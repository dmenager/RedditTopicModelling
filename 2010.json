Some species can (usually) be readily identified from a single photo, but these tend to be the iconic mushrooms like chanterelles, fly agarics, shaggy manes and the like.  The vast majority, on the other hand, will usually require a much more thorough inspection to be sure of the species.  There are, for instance, many medium-sized white-capped mushrooms.  Identifying features may include smell, texture, cap/stalk decoration, veil presence/appearance, volva presence/appearance, latex presence/color/change-in-color, gill color when young vs. old, flesh color/staining/time-it-takes-to-stain, substrate, nearby trees, etc.  Certain genera actually require a microscope in order to examine the spore size/shape!  \n\nI'll be glad to help where I can, just don't get your hopes up! ;)","subreddit_id":"t5_2r8ke","subreddit":"1000words"}

{"body":"According to Wikipedia: \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_World_War_II_Memorial#Freedom_Wall\n\nThe citation on the Wikipedia article is the following link:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_World_War_II_Memorial#cite_note-6\n\nEach star represents 100 Americans who died in the war.  So, whether or not that implies they were enlisted in the service or civilians on the frontline or both or including other casualties sustained on attacks of Americans abroad that were not directly fighting is unclear.\n\nAfter further reading the cited source I found this:\n\nWhy are there 4,048 stars on the wall? The designer says each star represents about 100 soldiers killed in the war. But the arbitrariness of this assignment of multiplication renders it meaningless. Worse, it vitiates the memorial's most profound purpose.\n\n&gt; A grim total of 405,973 members of the U.S. Armed Forces died in World War II. You do the math. More than a thousand have gone missing from the Freedom Wall. For so grave a fact in so momentous a setting, \"close enough\" isn't good enough. Imagine if a couple of dozen names had been left off the Vietnam Veterans Memorial for the sake of symmetrical design economy.\n\n(http://www.savethemall.org/updates/20040624.html)","subreddit_id":"t5_2r8ke","subreddit":"1000words"}

{"body":"i had this problem for a long time.\n\ni tried bumpfree razors, all kinds of shaving creams and gels, magic shave. i even tried facial depilatories. in my searches, i've ran across advice ranging from \"get your chick to pull out ingrowns every night\" to \"just grow a beard\"\n\ni realized that the problem really presents itself differently to different people, and i had to find a method that worked for me.\n\nAll that to say, my advice may or may not work for you. I have 2 techniques, depending on how you like to shave.\n\n**Close cut, no stubble**\n\n* Good News single blade disposable razors\n* use hot water and any kind of \"sensitive skin\" shaving cream or gel.\n* shave with the grain\n* wash face with a Buff Puff for exfoliation (CVS makes knockoff buffbuffs that work just as well).\n\n(the buff puff is the secret weapon here, as it helps free trapped hairs.)\n\n**Kinda-close cut. barely-noticeable stubble**\n\n* Use clippers (i have set of Wahl Balding clippers, and some regular hair cutting clippers-- they can both be used on the face, AND it looks kinda badassed to shave like this)\n* wash face with a chemical exfoliant (facial scrubs), or a buff puff \n\nThe balding clippers get very close, but you can still feel some stubble if you rub your hand against the grain. You can follow it up with a regular electric razor to try to clear out the stubble if you want, but i think its the very light stubble that prevents the razor bumps-- the hair never goes below the skin, so its less inclined to grow inwardly, and the exfoliation keeps them above the skin until the next shave.\n\nBut THE most important thing-- drink lots of water. Get your 64 ounces a day.\n\nI hope that helps. Good luck.","subreddit_id":"t5_2s36p","subreddit":"100BlackMen"}

{"body":"This is interesting, but I think you'll find a lot of those people's actions invoked the hatred of sports fans (whether or not the hatred is amplified by racism I cannot say).\r\n\r\n* Lebron left Cleveland with very little class, and was **narcissistic** enough to have a TV special for his decision. \r\n\r\n* Vick was part of a **dogfighting ring**. \r\n\r\n* Tiger woods **cheated on his wife**... a lot (people paid way too much attention to this I think). \r\n\r\n* Terrell Owens is a dick and has said many stupid, **egotistical** things.\r\n\r\n* Barry Bonds used **steroids**, as did A-Rod. \r\n\r\n* Kobe Bryant had a **rape** trial, as did Big Ben....\r\n\r\nI don't know about Kyle Busch, and I don't see much reason to had Sid.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyways...

Originally two, but for most of the project, just one, Wes Paugh.\n\n3.  I love nothing more than the development experience.  Of course, some elements of it were HELLISH, such as creating the logo.  We must have spent 100 hours overall on different logo designs.  I guess that's what happens when artists, NOT designers, try their hand at design.\n\n4.  Mm, yeah, something like that.  They've been OK, very good at first... we're still hoping for a big sales push once we can get published to IGN and GameSpot (who for some reason havent covered us yet).\n\n5.  As I said, the game had been in development for 18 months, so the game was *not at all* released early.  It was more a matter of, it's WAY WAY over budget, we can't afford to NOT release it.  We apologize for the buggy nature on the first few versions.\n\n6.  The genie-beetles no longer drop potions?   Are you *sure*?  I'm fairly certain that's not correct.  Generally, I want the bosses to be on the easy side, which is why I've been nerfing them.  This is because of the fact that they aren't random, unlike the rest of the game.  It still needs tweaking, though.  I don't mean to be heavy handed.\n\n7.  Shops are coming for 1.06 which should be in a few weeks.  We're already working our asses off on the new world (Hell), and after that we'll start on the Skellyman Scoundrel which will be the first new class.  We estimate that Hell will be out in 1-2 months, and the skellyman will be out maybe a month or two after that... although these are very rough estimates.\n\n8.  Some Korean guy posted pics from the end movie, although I don't know if he just cracked the game.  Anyway in 1.05 (which pushes to Apple Monday) Satan has been wildly nerfed.  If you got that far you should be allowed to see the damn ending movie =]\n\nThe information that the last 3 levels, enemies get far too strong is good.

{"body":"First-off, I have to say I love the idea of the game - an accessible roguelike / diablo style hybrid. I've had it since 1.00 and have played on and off a fair amount. The current implementation is almost stable, but the road to it has been pretty bumpy especially given the price at launch.\n\nI've written a lot here, hope you can find the time to respond :)\n\n- How long did it take you to develop?\n\n- How many coders were there? Were you on the coding team, or just design?\n\n- Did you enjoy the development experience? Would you do something like this again?\n\n- How have sales been? Enough to pay the rent and work on the game more?\n\n- There seems to have been a general lack of basic QA this far, it's shipped (even after patches) with bugs that even basic use would pick up on. Was there a lot of pressure to release early? Would more coders on the team have helped?\n\n- If you were under pressure to release 'as-is' and then incrementally fix / patch / implement the game as you wanted it to be, how long do you think it'll be before the vanilla game is bug-free and stable?\n\n- Since launch, it seems you have short release cycles and are trying to prioritise fixes?  Patches and game balance seem to be fairly arbitrary and heavy-handed (such as the [genie boss exploit](http://www.100rogues.com/forums/technical-issues/overheal-genie-boss-battle-exploit/) which was 'fixed' by preventing beetles spawning with potions at all, or the genie dropping potions upon death and reducing its overall hp; turning the fight from an interesting one into a normal 'hit until it dies' encounter), and patches have fixed certain things while breaking others.\n\n- Do you have a timeframe or scedule for implementing new features (such as the closed shops in-game, more levels, new classes, etc.)?\n\n- Has anyone ever legitimately beat the last boss? By the time I get to the lower levels (dungeon 3, 4) enemies hit like trucks and I don't really see feasible ways of getting through apart from abusing the various bugs and exploits around.\n\nI think the perfect roguelike is a game where, when you die, it's the player's fault and they get the sense where \"if I had *just done something differently* then I might have made it\". A game where you are encouraged to dive in again and again to get further. 100 Rogues is neat, but I think as it currently stands player death is normally either due to the game itself (i.e. bugs and crashes), or due to the design (i.e. reaching the last 3 levels enemies suddenly get far too strong and the player won't have enough potions or food or gear to go toe-to-toe with them, even when really lucky and super-careful all game).\n\n100 Rogues has the potential to be an iPhone classic, I think, but it needs some careful love and polish.","subreddit_id":"t5_2rv9v","subreddit":"100rogues"}

(perhaps the ones that blew their digits off while cleaning a Glock, or the victims of unsupported .40 chambers)\n\nOr perhaps people with a shitload of adrenaline and other OH SHIT THERE IS A DUDE RIGHT THERE HE IS TRYING TO KILL ME WAT DO chemicals in their system, which is a pretty surefire way to fuck with fine motor skills.

But a lighter recoil and a higher capacity are pretty strong arguments in favor of 9x19.  \n\n&gt;The fact that the kitchen smiths are building dangerous 1911s is NO argument for it being an unfit defensive gun.\n\nOf course not.

You either have to manipulate an external safety or pull a hammer back (and on many 1911s, this isn't even an option because the gun can go off if dropped with the hammer down on a live round), or carry with a hair trigger.  The same trigger that makes it pleasant to shoot at the range is what makes it dangerous to carry cocked and unlocked.\n\n[[Grip safeties can cause malfunctions at the worst possible time.](http://www.neardeathexperiments.com/smf/index.php?topic=4723.0;wap2)\n\nThe reliable 1911s are the ones with loose tolerances.  The accurate ones are the ones with tight tolerances.  Now, the accuracy won't make much of a difference at defensive firearm ranges, but it's still an annoying characteristic.\n\n9x19 will kill you dead just as well as .45 ACP.  Shot placement bru.

But like I said, it's one more level of derp.  And there's a lot of derp that happens in \"oh shit\" mode.  A DA trigger pull will be heavy, but it'll fire.  If you have a second or two, and the presence of mind to do so, then you can use that time to pull the hammer back.  Of course, if we're talking about a Glock, then the \"DA\" trigger mode is light enough that it'lll be fine.\n\n&gt;Recoil: Are we talking 8 year old girls here? \n\nNo, we're talking human beings in panic mode.

If you have a budget of $1000 for \"guns 'n stuff\" and you can spend $500 on your defensive firearm instead of $800, that's $300 more practice.  $300 more practice could mean a lot.  Obviously, it'd be nice if everyone had the cash to spend on Nighthawk 1911s and custom shopped SIGs and whatnot, but most of us have a limited budget to work with.

{"body":"Since Running_Bear23 isn't the only one I've seen hate on SAO, can I legitimately ask what's wrong with it compared to shotguns and rifles? I really cannot think of a single DA/SA longarm, yet in the handgun market they seem to be everywhere. I kinda laugh when someone who doesn't know about guns asks about \"the safety being on\" in regards to a handgun, real life or movies or whatever, not realizing that few handguns today even have them.\n\nMaybe it has something to do with, like Running_Bear said, some people being scared that they'll forget to take the safety off if the time ever comes to use it in defense, but I've never really had that fear since I've practiced enough times that it's just muscle memory now (and really so should everyone who's carrying). To me, if that's such an issue, why aren't military rifles DA/SA with a decocker, since they're the ones with the most chance to actually have to shoot someone and are, therefore, in the most situations to forget to flip the safety off?\n\nI guess the biggest defense of DA/SA is that you can learn to transition between a heavy first pull and the light subsequent pulls, but I just don't see why it's necessary (I guess it isn't, but more of a luxury, like automatic transmission vs. manual). SAO makes the gun more simplistic, which in turn makes it more reliable based on the idea that you have much less actual engineering inside the gun. Of course, you could go the Glock route and have SAO and just leave the manual safety out all together, haha (Glocks are cool by me, though, just FYI).","subreddit_id":"t5_2rtpo","subreddit":"1911"}

Some disturbing backstory on why, [here](http://www.semp.us/publications/biot_reader.php?BiotID=191):\n\n&gt; Why did the US Weather Bureau (forerunner of the National Weather Bureau) in St. Louis and Chicago not include a tornado forecast? Akins writes: \u201cThe answer lies in the official regulations of the time. *In 1925, the US Weather Bureau forbade government meteorologists to use \u2018tornado\u2019 in forecasts or in official reports, fearing such scare words might alarm citizens and curtail the general flow of commerce.* The word \u2018tornado\u2019 appeared only in summaries published months after the severe weather occurred.\n\n&gt; \u201cThis restriction had not always been in effect. As early as the 1880s successful tornado forecasting was evolving under the direction of Lieutenant John Park Finely of the US Army Signal Corps, but General Adolphus Greely, new chief of the Corps, put an end to this research in 1887 although he realized the danger from tornadoes. He banned the word \u2018tornado\u2019 in public forecasts, reasoning that the exact point of touchdown could not be predicted (even today exact predictions are not possible)\u2026.Writing in the Weather Bureau\u2019s Monthly Weather Review, in April of 1925, the editor summarized the prevailing ignorance: \u2018it must be reluctantly admitted that there is little hope that the actual conditions that initiate a tornado vortex will ever be experimentally observed.\u2019\u201d (p. 4)\n\n&gt; When was the ban on tornado forecasts finally made by the US Weather Bureau? It occurred almost exactly 57 years ago on March 25, 1948, when two scientists, Major Ernest Fawbush and Captain Robert Miller, assigned to Tinker Air Force Base near Oklahoma City, made their remarkable forecast of an imminent tornado after years of studying Finley\u2019s approach and weather conditions preceding and accompanying tornadoes.\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2s1dv","subreddit":"1920s"}

Another one like the 1925 tornado and the 1900 Galveston hurricane was [the Wisconsin Peshtigo fire in 1871](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peshtigo_Fire). Check out the map for the area it burned, it's *huge*. Most deadly fire in US history. From the wikipedia page:\n\n&gt; The fire was so intense it jumped several miles over the waters of Green Bay and burned parts of the Door Peninsula, as well as jumping the Peshtigo River itself to burn on both sides of the inlet town. Surviving witnesses reported that the firestorm generated a tornado  that threw rail cars and houses into the air. Many of the survivors of the firestorm escaped the flames by immersing themselves in the Peshtigo River, wells, or other nearby bodies of water. Some drowned while others froze to death in the frigid river.\n\nAnd it's ironic that this Peshtigo fire is overshadowed by the Chicago fire, yet the Chicago one was nothing compared to it. The Peshtigo fire wiped out all human settlement on that peninsula in Wisconsin, killing most people there. \n\nI think when things are bad enough, people just clamp up about it.

{"body":"Alright, here goes it:\nThere was a facade of problems in the 1920's. Right now I'm going to be focusing primarily on Taylorism (\"Scientific Management\"), the role of women in the household, Feminism in general, Racism, Fordism (Late 1920's, but still relevant), and how the roots of stifling innovation in the technological field were planted. \n\n1.**Scientific Management**\nScientific management, invented by Frederick Taylor, was a plague upon the 1920's that went on for far too long. Ultimately, Scientific Management was created\n&gt;To prove that the best management is a true science, restuing upon clearly defined laws, rules, and principles, as a foundation. And further to show that the fundamental principles of scientific management are applicable to all kinds of human activities, from our simplest individual acts to the work of our great corporations\n\nSo what did this lead to? Effectively using Americans as slaves (Note that outsourcing at this time was not available, so exploiting the Chinese like we currently do now was not an option). Here is a good video explaining Taylorism for you: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wa4_ihxT9rI Were you to watch those two videos, that is probably all that would need to be said in my argument.\n\nQuotes from \"A trade Unionist Attacks Taylorism\"\n&gt;...he has four specailized shop foremen: \"speed boss,\" \"repair boss,\" \"gang boss,\" and \"inspector boss\" (who) ... tell him exactly what feeds, speeds, tools and machines to use; how to hold the work, etc., leaving nothing to the workman's judgement. This eliminates skill and common laborers are used. Mr. Taylor holds a stop watch on the best workman while working fast, and leaves out the time on all such movements as he thinks as unnecessary. This gives a tremendous incentive to a man to exert himself to the utmost. **Mr. Taylor insists on individual agreement, and in any insistence on organized labor methods will result in discharge.** *\"...(it has) reduced the men to virtual slavery.\"*\n\nLenin on Taylorism:\n&gt;\"...like all capitalist progress, is a combination of the refined brutality of bourgeois exploitation and a number of the greatest scientific achievements in the field of analysing mechanical motions during work, the elimination of superfluous and akward motions, the elaboration of correct methods of work, the introduction of the best system of accounting and control, etc. The Soviet Republic must at all costs adopt all that is valuable in the achievements of science and technology in this field. (**Please note that this last sentence continues to go on to talk about the glories of Taylorism to suppress citizens and get work/money out of them to promote socialism/communism**)\n\nThere was widespread chaos due to Scientific management. There were strikes daily. One of the more notable strikes took place in 1913 at a military production plant. It was dubbed the \"Arsenal Strike\". Strikes occurred frequently,  but were hard to manage because trade unions were effectively banned.\n\n\n\n2.**Women in the Household**\n\nTo be written at a later time\n\n3.**Feminism in General**\n\nTo be written at a later time\n\n4.**Racism**\n\nTo be written at a later time\n\n5.**Fordism**\n\nTo be written at a later time\n\n6.**Stifling of Innovation/Radio regulations**\n\nTo be written at a later time\n\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2s1dv","subreddit":"1920s"}

{"body":"Install some kind of antivirus. Microsoft security essentials should be fine if you don't want to buy anything. No matter what anyone says about how \"they're careful\" and don't need an antivurus they are just kidding themselves. Everyone makes mistakes, even the most careful of us. Me personally, I'd rather be safe than sorry. Use a firewall, personally I use the firewall in ESET Smart Security and have my firewall mode set to interactive. This way whenever a program wants to access the internet it blocks it until I specifically allow it. At first it's a pain but once you get all your usual programs in you shouldn't notice it at all, and IMO it definitely works well against preventing any sort of keylogger or trojan from sending data from your PC without your knowledge. Obviously if you blindly allow whatever pops up it won't be that effective, but if you take a second to read what program is trying to access the internet you can usually make a pretty conscious decision.\n\nProbably the most important thing is.. **don't be stupid**. If something seems suspicious then don't be stupid and install some random \"codec\" to watch a video online. Sometimes they try to trick you by making it SEEM familiar when it's really not. Also watch out for exe downloads, only run what you KNOW you downloaded. Only install stuff like Adobe Flash/Shockwave and Java from their official websites. Also look out for a kind of popup telling you that you have viruses and you need to install some anti-virus program just ignore it.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is to keep your software updated (antivirus especially).

{"body":"Veralynn\nATT has network equipment that either can or cannot handle 6M, it also depends on whether you are connected to a remote facility or directly to the central office. The ability to get higher speeds is limited based on whether your location is serviced by one that can handle it or not. Generally the closer you are to a big city the better your chances are to be able to get a 6M connection. Unfortunately with ATT the problem is that if your connection is going through an older network card and there are not enough request for higher speed locally they will never change it as they are expensive.\n\nIt is indeed very possible(and most likely) that at your location they are lagging behind in technology. DSL has its own bandwidth between your home and the central office because it runs on its own pair of copper lines, once at the central office all the connections share the same bandwidth as they are routed through a DS3, fiber, etc.. so if there is enough traffic a bottleneck can still happen.\n\nI would call ATT tech support and ask them to provide you with a footprint of your connection, basically tell them you want them to verify sync at the NID and want to know exactly what the footprint is at the NID, tell them you have a chronic issue. The NID is generally located at the back of your house(Telephone box) or very close depending on your neighborhood, ATT is responsible for everything up to the NID, past that is the customer's responsibility, ie inside wiring, etc... With the proper information you can determine if the issue is at your end or theirs.\n\nA footprint will look like this:\n\nPort: Admin State: UNLOCKED, Oper State: IN SYNC\n\nRate: Up: 384, Down: 3552\n\nNoise Margin: Up: 25, Down: 23\n\nBandwidth: Up: 36, Down: 44\n\nAttenuation: Up: 4, Down: 8\n\nCustomer Port Status: Port Statistics Within Normal Parameters\n\n\n3 things we look for\n-Noise margin: on a 1.5M connection anything under 7 is marginal and indicates a problem\n-Bandwidth: the lower the numbers the better, might indicate noise in the line, unfiltered devices, etc..\n-Attenuation: the lower the better, is the loss of signal over distance. \n\nGet a footprint and post it here\n\n\n\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2rv00","subreddit":"24hoursupport"}

{"body":"Some additional tools that can help:  If you are using Firefox, get [AdblockPlus](http://adblockplus.org/) and [Web of Trust](http://www.mywot.com/), and optionally [NoScript](http://noscript.net/).\n\n**AdblockPlus** because lots of sites run flash-based ads that are served by third parties, who in turn let *fourth* parties (the actual advertisers) create and submit the ads that usually go *immediately* into rotation *without* any kind of vetting process.  This makes for an easy vector of transmission for flash-based exploits.  Too many links in a weak chain of trust makes for easy breakage.\n\n**Web of Trust** adds a community-sourced ranking for trustworthiness to links in search engine results and off-site links on blogs/forums/etc..  It is similar to the safe link toolbar that comes with antivirus products, like AVG, but the community sourcing of the ranking means that its system can respond to developing threats perhaps more nimbly than a corporate-managed solution.\n\n**NoScript** protects against XSS and sets a default for *disabling* Java, JavaScript, Flash and other plugins on most sites.  How do you know you want to trust a site to run all that stuff in your browser before you've even visited it?  Start with everything off, and if the site seems to work fine, leave them off.  If the site doesn't work as expected, start turning them on.  Notice that many sites have externally-loaded widgets that allow third-parties to track your online activities.  Those things can be permanently disabled.  The thing about NoScript that makes me consider it optional is that it adds a lot of active decision-making to web browsing, which is an activity that many people would prefer to have be a lot more passive, like watching TV.

{"body":"With wireless there are many reasons you could be losing connections.\n\nMy first suggestion is to check how many wireless networks are in your area (via your wireless PC) and determine if they are operating on the same channel.  Overlapping access points cause interference with each other.\n\nIf the ISP manages the Netopia routers you can call them and look for technical assistance.  If you bought the routers though you are on your own.\n\nAs far as the wired connection goes, an easy test to determine if your ISP is causing the slowness is a ping or traceroute test.  These can be done from the OS command line.\n\nping www.google.com\ntracert www.google.com\n\nSlowness will be indicated by response times.  I wouldn't expect Google to return anything more then 60ms and there should not be any dropped packets.  The trace route will indicate where along the path to Google the connection becomes slow.  If it begins showing slow response times or packet drops beyond your Netopia routers then it is an ISP issue.  If the trace route begins showing * then try plugging your PC directly into the ISP modem (if there is one) and try it again.","subreddit_id":"t5_2rv00","subreddit":"24hoursupport"}

If the clicking only occurs while it's spinning you can be pretty sure it's coming from your drive.\n\nAs far as the clicking becoming more or less quiet under other power settings, most modern OSs restrict use of peripherals when on a lower performance / power saving setting. I imagine hard drives are in this category.\n\n**Power Adapter** - Just because a power adapter is new doesn't mean it isn't broken. That brick on the adapter is built to act like a surge suppressor. So if your laptop got a power surge, it would burn out that brick instead of your machine. Granted, this would mean that the power supply wouldn't function at.all... but it's just intermittent for you which sounds a LOT like something that's making the connection between the PS and the computer is failing. Usually if the failing piece is on the power supply unit itself, you can see damage, whereas most of the time it's on the motherboard, you can't.\n\nAll-in-all, it might be worth finding someone with a laptop that is the same brand / similar make to yours and testing out their power cable... just because it's a difference between a quick $50 fix and potentially having to replace the whole system.","subreddit_id":"t5_2rv00","subreddit":"24hoursupport"}

I've never played Arkham Asylum on PC before, so I'm not intimate with the strain it puts on a machine, but I'd be fairly surprised if you could get a framerate above 10 without playing in 640x480 resolution. Now as far as your processor making up the difference, I won't outright say that a processor *can't* make up for a slower graphics card, but it takes one hell of a processor to do so. This is because CPUs and GPUs are very very different inside. Without getting into stuff you really don't care about, a CPU has a small number of actual processing units but a lot of space to store stuff that it's processing, where a GPU has massive amounts of processing units but small memory spaces because it is doing mostly very repetitive, parallelized processes. In fact, a GPU can be several thousand times faster at parellelizable processes than an equally fast CPU. Plus, the talking between two physically separate parts of the computer is a crawling pace compared to how quickly different segments of an individual component communicate.

When I've seen or had a power supply fail, it usually won't do anything: won't power the motherboard and won't show any sort indicator lights anywhere on the computer. In the one worst case I've seen, it started releasing that horrible, acrid blue smoke that told me it was time to unplug the power supply from the wall and replace it.\n\nAs for it not responding to the power switch, that could simply be where the problem is, and, like AnonymooseRedditor said, one of the small wires that connects the power switch to the motherboard that tells the power supply to turn on could either be unplugged or faulty. On most motherboards, that indicator light that seems to be always on, even if the computer itself isn't, is a way to identify if the motherboard itself is receiving power from the power supply. If that's on, as you've said, it might not be the power supply that is the issue here.\n\nI can't be too certain, obviously, without knowing more or actually working on the computer myself, but for right now one of your best bets is to check the wire connection the power button to the motherboard to see if it's unplugged or looks visibly damaged. If you're not sure which wire it is, try to follow any wire coming from the power switch and heading to the motherboard. They usually connect to the motherboard through one or two pins, but the wire itself could be bundled together with a bunch of other wires that connect to the front of your computer for the hard drive indicator light(s), the reset button (if you have one), etc. \n\nIf you have it still, check the manual that came with your motherboard as they usually have a diagram showing exactly where the pins are (and therefore were the wires are plugged into) on the motherboard. If the computer is from a manufacturer, chances are they didn't ship it out with the motherboard manual, but you can usually find a .pdf version of the manual on the computer manufacturer's website.\n\nHope this helps.","subreddit_id":"t5_2rv00","subreddit":"24hoursupport"}

{"body":"I spent the rest of the day working this out, and I finally stumbled upon a conclusion. If you were to look at my workspace right now, you would see quite a mess that I don't feel like cleaning up.\n\nI ended up taking out the sound card, the HDD, and the GPU individually (and in combinations!), each time rebooting ten times, timing how long it takes for it to POST. If it took more than a minute, then I listed it as a no-boot. I switched over to using an old HDD from my basement (a fantastic 6 gigs) after figuring out that it will never POST without a HDD, and I had to gut my father's computer to steal his GPU. I even managed to draw blood during these processes.\n\nIt turned out that the problem was with the video card. I don't know how the whole inoperative-keyboard thing works into this, but I had 20% success rate with my 8800GT, and 100% success with my dad's 8500GT. In addition (icing on the cake), on one of the times that I managed to get to Windows with the 8800GT, I decided to play for as long as I could, and I got some graphical artifacts.\n\nIn an attempt to save the 8800GT, I flashed the card's BIOS, but the problem persisted. A driver reinstall wont help; I did so recently back when I was getting BSODs, and it won't have anything to do with the problems during POST.\n\nI wonder still: **Is my GPU not getting enough power, or is it a bad card? Is a better PSU going to solve my problem, or must I replace the card? How can I test?** I'm 80% certain that the card is bad somehow, but I can't feel too secure.\n\nEdit: I have a spare power supply in my basement. Only 400 watts or so, but I might be able to hook that up so just the six-pin is plugged into my 8800GT, so all of the power on the +12v rail can go to the card. I'll have to wait until morning to test it. All other ideas are welcome.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEdit 2: **I bought an EVGA GeForce 9800GT off of NewEgg to replace my dead 8800GT. Not exactly the best of upgrades, but it was only like $80, a helluva lot less than I paid for my 8800GT back in the day.**","subreddit_id":"t5_2rv00","subreddit":"24hoursupport"}

If it does try \"reseating\" (ie, put it back) the DIMM you removed and see if it works still. If it reverts to the fail-state, dud RAM module likely. If no difference before and after pulling out/reseating, do not rule out dud RAM as there is likely to be RAM integrated onto your motherboard as with 99% of notebooks on the market. *PM me for detailed instructions of how to test this out.\n2. Do that memtest86+, let it run for a while. Try it with the extra memory both in and out (assuming you have extra RAM)\n3.

DISCLAIMER: only for the bold: Pull the notebook apart and clean the contacts for the monitor ribbon cable with methylated spirits (as this doesn't leave any residue or damage the copper).

{"body":"Ok I have read your post and some of these comments. Heat may definitely be an issue. If you have a spare box fan take the side of the case and just put the box fan next to the case. It is very ghetto but it works.\n\nSince your case is open, check loose wires/connections and look for a blown capacitors. If it is dusty you will need to blow that dirt out. Honestly canned air doesn't do much, but usually that's most peoples only option. If you have access to an air compressor with a nozzle adapter, use that. You need around 60psi. If you go this route, have small screwdrivers handy to stick in the fans because that much air will destroy the fans ball bearings making them unusable. On that note, boot up the computer and make sure all your internal fans are spinning properly.\n\nEnter the BIOS and do a \"restore to default/system settings\". The splash screen suddenly appearing means something in the BIOS has changed. It could be a glitch. Does anyone else have physical access to your machine? It could also mean your CMOS battery is dying. Next time you're in Windows make sure your time is right. That is the easiest way to determine if the battery is going. You can change the splash screen setting from within there. If you disable it again, and then it starts showing up, that is another sign your battery is going since it cannot retain your BIOS settings. If you have access to a multimeter, you can remove the battery (when the system is powered off and power cycled) and test it to see if it is at 3.3V. \n\nAnother easy thing to do is reseat the RAM. With the system powered off and power cycled, remove each ram stick, blow on the contacts to ensure they're clean, and place them back into the board. Since what you describe also sounds like video errors, you can reseat that card. Also, what is your GPU? Nvidia recently had a big screwup with a new set of drivers where the cards would be overworked, and therefore overheat and many people had cards burn up. Do a simple search on your manufacturers forums and see if anyone is having similar issues.\n\nOnce you can get back into Windows, stop playing all games for the time being. Check your computer properties to ensure your CPU is listed at the right frequency and you have the correct RAM showing. You should also install some form of temperature monitoring software and make sure your temps are in order. \n\nThese are all off the top of my head. There's many more things that can be checked/done, but do these first and hopefully one of these will fix your issues.","subreddit_id":"t5_2rv00","subreddit":"24hoursupport"}

The only thing I could think of that could break were the transistors.\n\nSo... I took each of them out and tested them one by one. There were about 25 on a single board.\n\nSure enough one of them was broken, but Sony had scratched away the surface of the transistor (because they're assholes). So I didn't know exactly what type of transistor to buy.\n\nRather than making a guess and breaking something I managed to find an old TV of the same model with a completely smashed screen. I bought it, and replaced the inverter, it cost around $70 for the broken TV. I salavged any useful bits and the rest of it was put in the skip.\n\nMake sure you don't go straight to the CCF bulbs in the back, I actually had a look at them first but came to the conclusion they would probably never break unless someone snapped them. After all it's a glass tube full of gas.\n\nI also had no LCD experience whatsoever but I still managed to get it fixed, my boss was very pleased, I was too. :D\n\n**TLDR: Strip it down, get to the inverters, test stuff, try to find an appropriate replacement.**\n\nOh, I also entered the model of the TV online and found a site that sold service manuals for about 4$. I bought one and that helped with making sure I put everything back together properly.\n\nEdit: You might find that the service manual will list all parts, as they're only meant to be given to the service engineers.

{"body":"Judging from Windows not reporting any software or kernel errors before it hangs it would be some piece of hardware is failing under load. So it's time for some puzzle solving!\n\nFirst remove any unnecessary hardware, this includes anything in your PCI slots that isn't essential eg sound card, network card. Any hard drives or cd-rom drives you don't need as well as anything in the USB slots, firewire whatever. Then attempt to see if playing games crashes it again as it could be external faulty hardware, or all external devices could be drawing a lot of power. Unlikely though but better check in case or you are wasting your time with the next steps.\n\nRun the (Intel burn in test)[http://downloads.guru3d.com/IntelBurnTest-v2.3-download-2047.html]  for at lest several hours on your computer and see if it hangs up. Note the results. If it does hang up on high CPU load CHECK THOSE CAPACITORS! \n\nNow assuming your overnight memory testing went without any errors then what you will have to do is invite one of your mates around with a similar computer to yours. \n\nIf the computer hangs then I would first try the PSU. Generally though never buy a second hand PSU again and the cheap PSU that claim 750watt (which is a ridicules amount btw) are not usually of a high quality. A genuine 750 watt costs about ~$150 new.\n\nSo take your friends PSU out and connect it to your computer and attempt to reproduce the error by using the Intel stress test and 3dmark on loop for several hours. If it doesn't crash, PSU can be assumed at fault.\n\nIf it doesn't crash during the CPU stress test or if the replaced PSU still fails then I want you to swap out your friends graphics card and ram and repeat the stress tests like above until you know what fails and what doesn't.\n\nAnyway's you get the idea, narrow it down until you have replaced everything including the motherboard and you will find what piece of hardware is at fault. Then replace that and you should be sweet.\n\nMy best bet though is if the crashes are becoming more and more frequent and occurring quicker each time it would be your capacitors leaking. The capacitor are generally situated in rows like (this clear example)[http://www.pctips.org.uk/assets/images/autogen/a_Capacitors.jpg] and as you can see the fat one with brown on top is leaking which is putting more pressure on the other capacitors and in return are getting fatter and starting to leak as well.\n\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2rv00","subreddit":"24hoursupport"}

It's easy to spot (lots of sticky residue) and it'll set off moisture stickers under the hood.\n\nSecondly, if it isn't booting after 48 hours, it isn't apt to due it again.\n\nI trashed a leased Dell laptop this way, and rather than trying to make up a fake story on why it wasn't working, I just told the help desk the truth. They laughed for quite a bit and explained that while I wasn't the first person to destroy his laptop with liquids, I was the first person to fess up to it. So they repaired it for free. :)\n\nThe good news is that typically the hard drive is on the polar opposite end of the computer. Even if your motherboard is trashed (as well as the components around it) the data should be easily recovered. I doubt any liquid got to it, the hard drive typically has a decently isolated cage for shock absorption.\n\nHow old is the computer anyways? How much did you spend on it new (or what are the specs)? There's a good chance it's not worth repairing and you should buy a new laptop instead (you don't have to go all out and spend two grand if this is the case.)","subreddit_id":"t5_2rv00","subreddit":"24hoursupport"}

You can easily take apart the LCD bezel (Look under those stupid rubber footies, there are screws under there to take out, from there it just snaps apart w/ pressure switches) and get a part number off the back of the LCD, get a new one on ebay. For a dv5 should be looking around 95$ for a new screen (might be a bit more or a bit less)\n\nAs far as the part number; first look for an HP sticker that has a 6 digit-3digit number on it (like, 417854-001) the second set will almost always be a 001 (actually everyone I've seen has been 001 heh.) Search ebay for that number; find someone with a whole crapton of sales (make sure to flag the \"New\" and \"US Only\" options on the left side) and buy it. When you install the new screen its just a matter of plugging the cable in and letting it fly (figuratively.) One tip - When you replug the cable back in, put a piece of scotch tape over it to hold it in place (it usually has a fabric tape on it but this just makes sure nothing comes loose)\n\nOdds are with a repair service it'll cost you around 150 for a screen (40% and higher markup is average, and you can bet they're getting their parts from ebay probably unless its something like Best Buy) and usually 50-80 in labor on top of that depending on the shops labor charges.","subreddit_id":"t5_2rv00","subreddit":"24hoursupport"}

{"body":"The hard drive replacement on a MacBook is rediculously easy. If its the hard drive the Mac should power on and chime. If it doesn't chime try doing a PRAM reset (hold Command+Option+P+R and then hit the power button, continue holding those buttons until you hear the machine repeat the boot chime for three times). If that doesn't work you can try resetting the SMC as well. Pull the battery and remove the charger cable. With NO POWER hold the power button for 10 seconds. If you still get no chime or you get one long tone then you might have a bad ram module. You can remove one module and test, then swap the modules and test again to try to isolate a bad module. All MacBooks are DDR2-800mhz compatible (with the exception of the 2010 models, they can be destiguished because they have NO firewire 400 port) which is a highly available spec of RAM and can be found on sites like www.newegg.com for CHEAP. If one of the sticks is bad then replace it (or both) with a matching chip.\n  \nIf it still doesn't chime then its likely a logic (mother) board issue and needs some serious repair. If you get a chime at this point you'll likely see a flashing ? or a folder icon with a ? in it. This would indicate that the drive is dead and needs to be replaced.  \n  \nGo to www.ifixit.com and find your machine (you can find your model printed on the bottom of the macbook or in the battery bay.

Or you can go to an Apple Store and purchase Snow Leopard. All MacBooks are compatible with Snow Leopard.  \n  \nEDIT: Some people might also tell you that the GPT table on the drive might have just been corrupted and you can just reinstall the OS. I can tell you from experience that you'll save yourself a headache and have the piece of mind of having a nice squeaky clean drive if you just buy a new drive. You got a FREE computer.

I found an old website that showed some reasonable benchmark times for the 250, and I just compared them with the Mustang's for comparison's sake.\n\nHaving driven a mustang as well, and gunned it with both, I can more or less attest to the sensation of acceleration feeling very similar as well. It's mainly meant as a very broad statement to avoid nitpicking details, and to give a relative experience that most people will have felt at some point in their life (if not a mustang GT, then some similar sports car).","subreddit_id":"t5_2s4o3","subreddit":"250r"}
{"body":"Here's a couple things:\n\n* In case you were wondering, the pre-gens ('86-'07) have enough ground clearance to jump curbs, but do it slowly. Edit: The new-gens probably do too, but I don't have any experience with it.\n\n* If you do any maintenance on the bike **make sure you have a good, accurate torque wrench** and make sure you *know how to use it.* If it's in foot-pounds, make sure you can set it low enough for the small torque values some bolts need. If it's in inch-pounds, make damn sure you're really good at conversions. \n\n* The pre-gens *don't* have a separate oil pan. Your oil drain bolt screws directly into the lower half of the engine casing. The engine casing is made of aluminum, and strips very easily. If you fuck it up, you either have to tap it out to the next size, or [helicoil](http://www.emhart.com/brands/heli-coil) it. Ask me how I know.\n\n* The bike is *light*. Really light. This is good for handling and if you ever have to push start it or walk it to the next gas station. It's good and bad that it only takes two people to lift it into the back of a truck: If you break down you don't need to call a wrecker, but some asshole thief with a friend can just pick your bike up and drive away with it. \n\n* The stock 250 **does** have enough power to wheelie. You have to have it in first and you have to rev the shit out of it (for my highest wheelie I popped the clutch when I was at about 11k. seriously.)\n\n* Speaking of revs, this might be the most important piece of advice I give: **Don't be afraid of high RPM.** It depends on your bike and any mods you've done, but the powerband generally starts at about 8.5k and goes all the way to 11. Max torque doesn't happen til something like 11,500. It you're cruising around at 6-7k, the bike is going to feel sluggish and underpowered, and it's why a lot of people dismiss the 250 as slow. \n\n* Eventually, somebody is going to give you shit for riding a 250. It will more than likely be a 20-something-year-old on a literbike or 600 supersport. **Ignore them.** Don't *ever* feel like you need to have a big bike to be a good rider. \n\n* Fun fact: with the aid of a bungee net, the pre-gens can [carry a case of beer on the back.](http://imgur.com/myVQW.jpg)\n\n* Use your trip odometer as a fuel gauge. I used to fill up around 180 miles to be safe, but your gas mileage will vary depending on how you ride it. Just for reference, the tank (on the pre-gens) holds 4.8 gallons and the reserve setting on the fuel petcock lets you use the last .8 gallon. It'll get you another 50 miles or so. \n\n* As a kind of design flaw, the engine will burn a little bit of oil if you run it at high RPMs for a long time. Check your oil level before every ride (you should be doing T-CLOCS anyways) and add as needed. Unless there are oil spots under the bike, don't worry if it's a little low. \n\n* If you're itching for better throttle response, there's a [very simple, nearly free mod you can do](http://www.ninjette.org/forums/showthread.php?t=26270) to get a little more zip when you twist the throttle.\n\n* The top speed is somewhere around 100, so don't expect to keep up with the literbikes in the straights. Another 250 owner I know is into land-speed racing, and his modified 250 has only hit an actual (not indicated) speed of about 118. \n\n* With a good rider, the 250 will handle better than any literbike. Once you get good enough, expect to be passing bigger bikes in the corners. \n\nThat's all I can think of for now. There's probably more. \n","subreddit_id":"t5_2s4o3","subreddit":"250r"}

{"body":"I just purchased this 07 Ninja 250 two weeks ago and was riding it home from work yesterday when I heard a terrible engine sound like someone threw a handful of pebbles into the cylinder head and then the motor cut out.  I coasted to a stop and checked for physical damage, leaks or smoke and finding none I tried to turn it over again.  The starter turned freely with no resistance like it wasn't spinning the internals.  I wheeled it into a parking lot and called a friend to bring me my tools.  \n\nI popped the valve cover off and it was immediately obvious what the problem was -- the timing chain was off of the exhaust cam gear ... not only that but the whole timing gear was snapped off of the camshaft and one of the cam splines was cracked.  One of the bolts that secures the gear to the camshaft had apparently backed out and fallen off (or backed out far enough to snag on something) causing the catastrophic unraveling... that bolt was wedged in the front of the head between the wall and the broken gear.\n\nI had it towed home and am contemplating my options.  Looks like a new cam and gear is going to cost as much as a used engine -- not to mention I have no experience with getting the chain back on and re-establishing the proper engine timing.  Then there's the issue of the untold number of metal bits that are now distributed inside the engine.  Just kinda wanted to vent but if anyone has any input I'm open to hear it!\n\n**Edit** Bought a complete cylinder head with valvetrain for $100 locally and bolted it up this weekend.

{"body":"torque and engine displacement tend to have a relatively direct correlation. however Horsepower is derived from the torque and the RPM the engine spins. so with newer technology, muliple cylinders and a very high RPM redline something like an R6 will make about 110HP at around 14 thousand rpm. it makes about 45ftlbs of torque. a 600cc single cylinder will make about that same torque but will only spin up to about 7 or 8 thousand RPM, thus only putting out a peak torque around 50 HP.\n\nIf two engines make about the same torque, and are running at about the same speed, then they will have equal acceleration, assuming they weigh the same. However this race would not last long, after the bikes have reached about 7K rpm, the single cylinder runs out of revs and horsepower, while the 4 cylinder continues to rev higher and higher, building much much more acceleration as it nears its 110HP peak.\n\nThere are mitigating factors of course. the single will likely make more torque over a wide range of rpm, while the 4 cylinder has been tuned for higher torque at a higher RPM. The single will also weigh considerably less.\n\nSo in terms of what happens when you are cruising along and suddenly open the throttle, the Single will jump forward faster, but the sportbike would scream past you a second later.\n\nthis post of mine explains better probably \nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/dyop5/turn_40_next_month_was_going_to_get_another/c13xa8b\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2s4o3","subreddit":"250r"}

I have like six or seven of them sitting on my shelf at home, and I've reread them each about a dozen times because they're so. damn. funny.)\n\n* Jane Austen (she's been mentioned elsewhere, but she's wonderful.  Pride and Prejudice is my absolute favorite book ever and I read it about once or twice a year.)\n\n* Zora Neale Hurston (she wrote a book called *Their Eyes Were Watching God* which is devastatingly beautiful to read.  It's got one of my favorite quotations of all time, which goes thus: \"The inaudible voice of it all came to her. She saw a dust-bearing bee sink into the sanctum of a bloom; the thousand sister-calyxes arch to meet the love embrace and the ecstatic shiver of the tree from root to tiniest branch creaming in every blossom and frothing with delight.

{"body":"I'll respond a bit!\n\n\u2022 Realism. There's a writing style known as realism that, if you're exposed to it, can be very very dull indeed. Realism is ALL ABOUT the details, and not at all about the action. I find this one of the most compelling things about Tolkien's writing- his attention to the finite details that allow me to imagine almost perfectly in my mind what he sees in his. This also allowed the movies to become the vision that so many fans experienced while reading the novels. I was floored when I saw Rivendell come alive onscreen- it was so close to what I personally created in my mind as I read.\nIf you're reading the books with the expectation of a movie-like pacing, you'll be sorely disappointed. This is an issue you will find with many older books that you attempt. They are slower, pay more attention to the details and yes, sometimes, nothing happens. And that's fine, because the books arne't about the plot, they're about the world created within the pages, and the plot is secondary.\n\n\n\u2022 I feel very connected with some characters, and not at all with others. I actually think he wrote the characters brilliantly, but if you can't connect with them, sometimes that's just how it is.\n\n\n\u2022 there are many men, and very few women. And honestly, I couldn't give a damn.

Octavia Butler is hard to find but good female-focused sci-fi, mostly about relationships, sex, aliens and the future, and quite unlike the male-focused sci-fi I have read. \n\nI really enjoyed *The Vanishing Act of Esme Lennox* (on putting young women in mental institutions for ridiculous reasons in the 1930s), it was hard to put down. I'd certainly love to read something by Maggie O'Farrell again. I'm also looking forward to the next novel I read by James McGee (historical adventure, spies). \n\nI have Ken Follett's *World Without End* on my night-table and want to read it. I'd gladly read Neil Gaiman or Sidney Sheldon again, thought-provoking or no. \n\nAs for picking books as a group, I wonder how we go about this?

It's like rowing a boat through white water rapids. Stopping the rowing gets you taken off somewhere quite strongly at times. Adjusting the breath is like adjusting the strength of rowing in relation to the stream. This brings about equilibrium. \n\nThe bodily fabrications are first to be stilled but they have a reciprocal relationship to the mental fabrications. Relating everything back into the frame of the body lets you attend to the rising and passing of mental fabrications by setting up a contrast between the body and breath. This time, tranquility was attained without much of a fight, but so what? The important part of this sit was having the freedom to go with one of the fabrications to see its drawback, then reel the mind back in to the breath.. sort of like fishing where you need to release the line to tire the fish out and reel it back in.  \n\n.

{"body":"Perhaps it would be helpful to  use stages for your meditation when doing 10 minutes or more? That usually helps me with relaxing and not worrying about how much time has passed.\r\n\r\nOne classical way of structuring a mindfulness of breathing meditation is the following four stages:\r\n\r\nStage 1) Count the breaths up to ten as you finish them, ie &lt;in-out&gt;1, &lt;in- out&gt;2,... \r\n\r\nStage 2) Count the breaths as they are beginning, ie 1&lt;in-out&gt;, 2&lt;in-out&gt; ....\r\nThis usually helps in sharpening the mind and being present through the entire breath.\r\n\r\nStage 3) As your mind gets calmer and more focused, let go of the counting and just follow the breath as it is. \r\n\r\nStage 4) Focus your concentration on the feeling at your nostrils as the breath enters and then leaves. Feel the sensations, if it's hot or cold, quick or slow.\r\n\r\nYou could try using your two timers as a signal to shift between stage 1 and 2.\r\n\r\nRegarding your other issue, you're right that trying to keep thoughts out is rarely helpful. An accepting attitude towards yourself and your mind is important. One  parable I like is that meditation is like watching a pond with a lot of ripples and waves. As one continue focusing on ones breath, going back to it whenever drifting away, the waves slowly disappear and the mind becomes clear. The key is to not try and stop the waves (thoughts), but to have patience and observe them, giving them time to recede on their own.","subreddit_id":"t5_2ryuk","subreddit":"30daysit"}

I set [Mindfulness Bell](http://www.fungie.info/bell/) to 5 and 10 minute intervals and focused on my breath. One of the biggest distractors was worrying about posture. I was just sitting on a chair, I don't have a cushion and I can barely even sit cross-legged for 15 minutes comfortably. At this point I think I need to focus more on besting mental distractions, rather than physical ones.\n\nI ended up continuing for much longer than I originally planned, for a total of about 50 minutes. I kept switching up the object of my meditation but my goal was to work on my concentration. After a while I became aware of a space in my consciousness that didn't seem to be the room I was in. When I focused on the space it got larger and seemed to surround me. I felt really large, like I filled up the whole space. Soon I decided to try saying \"om mani padme hung.\" I wasn't getting much out of that until I decided to concentrate on my whole body. The experience was almost overwhelming; I could feel the changes in sound on my whole body, and the experience of sensing my actual body started to fade in comparison.\n\nI'm still not quite sure what I should be focusing on, so hopefully it becomes more apparent over the next few days.

{"body":"40 min. After the first three steps in mindfulness of breathing, my mind calms. There is very little of the thinking mind at all, but in its place is another kind of momentum. A constriction of the mind that comes from grasping. Imagine the grasping that goes on with the chatter of the thinking mind: the imagery, the words, the fantasizing. Now wipe all of that out and keep only the volition of the grasping. \n\nThis persisted throughout the sit. Once it became clear what was going on, the choices were basically two:  either let the grasping motivate and distract the focus or allow it to just be there and put more energy into concentrating only on the breathing in the body.\n\nThat this happened makes a lot of sense and it has to do with prematurely going into analysis of mental qualities. This pattern remains constant. To break it, I allow anapanasati (mindfulness of breath) to be linear then nonlinear, moving back and forth between the stages as I need to. This \"refines\" the focus and undercuts the clinging. Things get more and more subtle. During this sit I didn't move back and forth between the stages so much as I did bulldoze my way into calming the mind (and that bulldozing had grasping for sensual desire as its intent) :D","subreddit_id":"t5_2ryuk","subreddit":"30daysit"}

{"body":"It seems the normal introspective sit for me has changed.  The last couple of days I've noticed that just sitting and looking into the internal world does not produce the PCE experiences.  However, I think I found a way to get the PCE to stick when sitting.  \nI have these desk plants, if I look at them in wide eyed wonder and notice the individual leafs and how the light bounces off those leafs it seems to make it more likely to happen.  This reminds me a lot of, \"beginners mind\" in zen.  What's interesting is that thoughts still happen, but not when in the mode itself, which is obvious if colors seem more vivid and \"shiny\".  However having a timed amount for sitting seems almost counterproductive.  It's really a regular life sort of practice.  \n\nSome questions:\n  \n* Does subvocalization (reading something and hearing the words in your mind) still happen when getting into this state 'deep' enough?\n\n* Also last week I was in a largely Dark Night territory, which seemed to impact the ability to get into it.  I was still able to go outside and wander about which seemed to work, but DN makes all this harder to do.  \n\n* Aside from the obvious lack of regular emotions (which is really a good thing), do thoughts remain or is thought a sign that you're not in that mode? \n\nEdit:\n\nThere was a minor shift in how I look at things.  It seems that the perspective has changed slightly, now it's more like the PCE is the default state, and then everything arises within that and move you about (it seems the thoughts themselves are intruding upon this state), and whether or not thoughts are present changes how I would act.  We'll see how long that lasts.  Might have been a shift into equanimity, since there is a bliss thing in the background, although not really paying attention to that.    It's a different equanimity experience than when doing vipassana though, and largely is in the background.  \n\nEdit: Seems that's reverted itself again, mostly in an introspective mode now.

{"body":"&gt; As I was remembering, I was working to decide if time in meditation should be used only to let thoughts pass by, or if it's okay to ruminate on something.\n\nWell...it's not NOT okay to ruminate on something, but it's not really what we're doing in mindfulness meditation.  \"Meditate on something\" = yes!  Why don't you try starting with your breath?  Sit nice and straight and locate the sensation of breathing at one place in your body.  The abdomen, maybe, or the tips of your nostril. Focus your attention on the breath going in, out, in, out.  When you find, inevitably, that your attention has wandered, with as much kindness, gentleness, and lack of self-judgment as possible, just note \"thinking\" and bring the attention back to the breath.\n\nIf your mind is really going bonkers, it can help to count your breath: \"One\" inhale, \"one\" exhale, \"two\" inhale, \"two\" exhale, and so on up to 10, and then back to 1.  When you realize you've lost count or have stopped counting, gently go back to one.","subreddit_id":"t5_2ryuk","subreddit":"30daysit"}

What's also interesting is that the cycles of insight are non observable when you really get into it.  \n\nI'm slowly coming to the conclusion that eyes open/closed has vastly different territory to explore.  The difference seems to be extraspection (focusing on the outside) vs introspection (focusing on the inside, which vipassana mostly focuses on even if those sensations seem to come from the external world).  I don't think the distinction has to do with where the stimuli comes from, but how one inclines the mind.  I know it seems a subtle distinction, but it seems that it has something to do with the method of inquiry + what 'you focus' on.  ","subreddit_id":"t5_2ryuk","subreddit":"30daysit"}

{"body":"40 min. Focusing only on the first 3 stages of anapanasati. There are two ways my energy drops as I get focused. \n\nFirst, I get very calm and the calmness itself throws my attention into \"calm\" and into fuzziness rather than focusing \"into\" the breath. When this happens, a foothold is created for the hindrances to take root and start the mind running off.   \n\nSecond, concentration in samatha develops and strengthens, but not to the degree to which it would be appropriate to go too far in analyzing the mental fabrications. Analysis is required for samatha, no doubt, but there is juuuust the right amount of energy I can put into analyzing mental fabrications before they carry me off or the hindrances arise. There is a back and forth with this that strengthens discernment exactly like doing bicep curls makes your arms strong and able to lift more.\n\nAs that discernment develops, less of my time is wasted spiraling off and I can catch it a bit quicker. \n\nThis is my last sit tonight, so I missed one.

I did some more testing, and it seems that I still can read, and subvocalization doesn't occur, it seems it's more automaticly picking up and understanding the material.   However, I'm not sure, because to contemplate the concept of subvocalization snaps one out of this state.  \n* Dark Night refers to a specific meditation territory that you come across if you practice vipassana:\nhttp://web.mac.com/danielmingram/iWeb/Daniel%20Ingram%27s%20Dharma%20Blog/The%20Blook/740E1DCD-75A5-4859-8530-13214BE1BA33.html\nBasically the stages from an emotional point of view start with lazyness, depression, anxiety, etc.  Sensations themselves seem to be slippery, and it's basically like your mind is buzzing and uncomfortable.\n* Again, I'm talking about a specific mind state, thought in general flips on and off in other territory as well, if you get deep enough into the concentration jhana's thought is mostly absent, as well as if you do vipassana long enough, thought is just another sensation that rapidly disappears.  However, it still arises into awareness in the first place in the case of vipassana.  What's interesting with this state is that it's outwards looking, not inwards, and if you get into it enough it seems thoughts don't arise at all, at least so I've tested.  It seems though that the cycles of insight (which include the dark night), are largely pushed to the background when in this state, and not in the same way as with concentration. \n\nAt the moment I'm just exploring PCE mode, and haven't refined it into a concrete concept just yet.\n\nNope, never saw that song.  Basically the Dark Night sucks, you feel miserable, sometimes paranoid, and down in the dumps.  It's right after the Arising and Passing away, which is usually very energetic and manic, and afterwards the DN you hit into equanimity which is a very peaceful bliss and spacious (I have some stories about this in my comment history if you want to look for it, or just ask if you want a story).  There's really nothing you can do to escape it after you hit the A&amp;P, so just sitting for a couple of days and slogging through it is probably the best thing to do.  Except perhaps this practice, which is rumored to work as a permanent method, but that question is just being explored right now.  \n\nEdit:\n\n[Hurricane Ranch: Tarin and Daniel on AF Part I](http://www.interactivebuddha.com/files/01%20TandDonAF1.mp3)\n\n[Hurricane Ranch: Tarin and Daniel on AF Part II](http://www.interactivebuddha.com/files/02%20TandDonAF2.mp3)\n\nThat's the discussion on this mode of experiencing.  So far what they're talking about makes sense and I can replicate to a certain degree.  I haven't tested going into jhana from this mode.  And other claims they had.  \n\nI think however this has been done before by the zen guys, despite what they say in the talk.  I definitely remember somewhere of a zen master and therapist news story, and they mentioned the elimination of all affect, and it seemed legit in the way it was described, as opposed to just rumor.  \n\nAs for the other Buddhist people, I can only speculate.  Some of the stuff they talk about is seemingly familiar to this state, however they aren't very clear with what they mean and talk in riddles, or they could only be talking about the non permanent experience of this state plus arahantship only.  \n","subreddit_id":"t5_2ryuk","subreddit":"30daysit"}

I've learned not to fear 'negative' thoughts, as all phenomena are impermanent. Have you seen the [ten oxherding pics](http://www.expressionsofspirit.com/10bulls/tenbulls.htm) before? They can be very helpful in seeing our relationship to our mind.","subreddit_id":"t5_2ryuk","subreddit":"30daysit"}
{"body":"&gt; Do you basically mean that things happen automatically? \n\nRegarding the instrument/artist reclassification: A certain amount of trust is established between internal and external worlds allowing flow to occur. I have examined the teachings on non-duality and find them to be wholly correct so far. I accept all experiences that the day brings to me, though sometimes more skillfully than others. Still subject to anger at external circumstances. However the focus is rarely far away from the internal world, observing the mind leap from station to the next, searching for its home. Instead of controlling the mind as it casts about I give it space. Stretch it out. Things arise, I acknowledge them on the spot. They disappear. In the words of my teacher, \"leave the front door open, but don't invite your thoughts to tea.\" I am very much connected to the sensate phenomena. For me at least, the senses are our gateway to the world. We literally become the food we eat, the people we entertain, the shows we watch on the television. And in that way, we release from the prison of the separate ego and allow the forces of the world to make us pliant and humble. \n\n* Both sitting and walking are daily practices. I freaking love walking meditation. It's truly a joy to go barefoot down the road or through the bushes. Feeling *everything*. I also include working meditation during the 9-5. Eating meditation to practice compassion for the living beings that gave their lives so I could sustain mine. Taken together I spend a lot of time watching the mind. I look deeply at my emotions whenever they bubble up. I am still learning to practice skillfully, and some people/places/things trigger cascading anger, but the battle is almost won. My mental culture is radically different from when I started practicing 18 months ago. \n\n* I used to practice only eyes open. But these days I spend a lot of time with eyes closed. I like to alternate. Eyes closed represents transcending the senses, whereas eyes open is accepting the input with equanimity and non-discrimination. The jury is still out on this one, the experiments not yet run to conclusion. But at the moment it seems that eyes closed is better quality for observing the workings of the mind. \n\n* The main focus is on observing mind. But I do use breath as a prop for framing mind's activities. My mind wanders with high frequency. I steer it back to the present moment many times during a sitting or walking or whatever. When mind is especially restless I allow my breath to serve as a facilitator. As Thanissaro Bhikku puts it, the breath is like a watering hole. All the animals of the forest at one point or another during the day arrive there to have a drink. The water is our breath so we should use the breath to meet all the animals (different thoughts, somatic phenomena, etc). My zen instructor stresses that we should move toward doing away with anchors like the breath and eventually perceive mind in mind, thoughts in thoughts, sense objects in sense objects. But I still lean on the breath quite a bit. While maintaining awareness of the mind's scattered nature, I've developed really strong concentration as an unintended consequence. When I have the luxury I can sit for 40 minutes in really solid zazen. No anxiousness. No thoughts on when this sitting will end. Patiently waiting for whatever arises. \n\n* Thank you for the opportunity to blether away on this topic. I have tried to convey the essentials in detail for you. Please let me know your approach to sitting/walking, to eyes open/closed, and focus. I would like my practice to deepen and widen. Hearing about others' ascent up the mountain helps me map my own way. \n\n&gt; There are also insights into pain itself, where you notice that pain does not equal suffering.\n\nToo right. Such a big moment to see them 'separated.' Suffering for me includes the fear that \"I can't make this pain in my back go away .... ever!\" Pain is the process of realizing, the actual physical sensation of pain that occurs in my back is actually minuscule compared to the fear of never-ending back pain. Pain is an acquaintance these days. Pleasure is not to be trusted. \n\n&gt; You just do things.\n\nAh, the Nike teachings. Strap on those size 10's, and Just Do It. Sounds like we have some similar experiences. I'm definitely more receptive to the Vipassana method as I practice more. Something tells me that Zazen is a delight, but it may not be the right path for me. I got into the practice of Zazen because I was an empiricist, an atheist, and zen was the least compromising and least devotional of the flavors of Buddhism. Well, so it seemed at the time. The more I practice just sitting, the more I believe in the unseen workings of the mind. It's an intuitive belief at this point, not based on actual observation. But it's one of the things I truly dig about this practice, the freedom to play and experiment. When I find something that really works, it opens up the motivation to practice beyond mere dilettantism. I don't have much time though. I'm 30. This life goes quickly, and I do plan to master a set of teachings, be they Tantra or Vipassana or Zazen. \n\nI have a question I'd like your input on. I've heard that Vipassana emphasizes looking deeply. If you practice this technique, have you encountered anything like a \"deeper\" layer of the mind? I have a feeling sometimes that my surface mind is not always in harmony with my subtler, basal mind. Please weigh in on this if you can, in any way possible. Many thanks. Sorry I didn't get back sooner but this has been such a good dialogue I wanted to set aside the time to do it some justice. Plus I needed the time today to mull things over and, verbose though this reply may seem, I wanted to distill my experience into the most salient points I could muster.

{"body":"Undetermined amount of time drawing, lightly tuning into pure action sensations (well, what arises from action, although it can't be directly observed), and letting the body do it's things.  I think this is a manifestation of the Pure Conciousness Experience mode that's being explored here:\n\nhttp://www.dharmaoverground.org/web/guest/discussion/-/message_boards/message/600967\n\nI agree with their description, the cycling when doing this practice is pretty much gone, and it seems only very light sensations seep through once in awhile.  When in it, everything is very clear, direct, solid (as opposed to vipassana sensations arising in and out of awareness in a vibratory manner) and perfect.  \n\nIt seems to be best achieved for me when either drawing or walking, and giving into where reality wants to take you (with drawing, let the pen move on it's own, with walking, relax and let yourself walk wherever you walk), having a childlike fascination with the sensate universe also works for awhile, but you get tired of this after doing it a long time.  With the walking thing, it's interesting in that this mode doesn't respect property rights :-P (Telling yourself not to play in a persons lawn snaps you out of this mode).  I suspect there is a difference between outside and inside (nature vs sitting inside a room), but I haven't compared them side by side yet.  \n\nWhat's interesting is my prior investigation into concentration states, one pointed and wide don't seem to be this state either (none of the jhanas).  Same with just sitting with wide open and closed eyes by themselves.  What's interesting is that it seems the eyes wide open has something to do with it, however, in my regular practice of just sitting it doesn't seem eyes open equals this state which I'm talking about.  In fact, I think sitting itself and attending to the introspective world is part of the problem.

Feelings of guilt. This is not how a meditation challenge should feel. Overwhelming and forbidding.

Instead of a full month of commitment, it could be one week at a time. That way if someone gets overwhelmed in their week they can easily jump back in. \n\nI greatly appreciated the effort everyone put into the 30 Day Sit. Well done all of us!

{"body":"30 minutes. Three of the hindrances were prominent:  restlessness born of aversion and sloth as a separate hindrance in and of itself. The interesting thing to note was how energized I was on aversion prior to starting the meditation. \n\nI spent time discerning where skillful attention should be developed by slipping off of the sensation of the breath into the sensation of restlessness. I amplified the restlessness by focusing on it and discerned that its sensation was in the body, especially around my eyes, back of the neck and chest. Next, focus was placed back on the sensation of the breath and it was held there relentlessly. I discerned the calming of bodily fabrications as my muscles softened and tension exited the party. The momentum of thoughts slowed significantly but wasn't yet stilled.\n\nThere would be moments where aversion crept back in as a bodily sensation, not necessarily as thoughts, each time a bit lesser. Each time it crept back in, it was discerned and noted that ardency was required. Putting strong focus on the breath, breathing in long, I discerned the hindrance cease and that the focus gave rise to ease and stilled the thinking mind. \n\nUpon giving rise to ease, my focus slipped off of the breath into ease rather than letting ease persist while remaining ardent. No joy was present, no singleness was present. The experience was diffuse. This opened a foothold for mindfulness to slip and for discernment to weaken. Once my discernment was weakened, indulging myself in ease, I fed the hindrance of sloth and gave it fuel to persist. Mental chatter was stilled but a blurry haze came over me. I took deep breaths to feed ardency as a factor for awakening and to starve the hindrance of its fuel. \n\nThe bell rang and it became clear again of the need for mindfulness off the cushion. Had I not slept at such an hour last night, this physical sluggishness wouldn't be such an obstruction to developing concentration. \n\nPlan of action for the next sit tonight:  a cup of coffee and using the concentration to explore the feeling of sloth in the body. Where is it sensed in my body primarily? Slack posture? A sense of heaviness in the muscles of the skull? A sensation on the eyelids? \n\nIt's clear that today is all about deep sharpening of discernment and ardency on the trickier subtle sensations. \n\nMore later.

{"body":"In terms of the [five hindrances](http://www.audiodharma.org/series/1/talk/1808/): You give rise to clinging to sensual desire which gives birth to aversion. This is awesome and a chance to gain insight into a very important topic. The Buddha said there are four types of experience along the path: fast and easy, fast and painful, slow and easy, slow and painful. Everyone is different! :D \n\nNow lets talk about the breath... \n\nWhen you breathe, it affects the whole body. The mechanics of breathing in and out causes the chest and belly to rise, the throat to open and close, feelings of coolness or heat, change in heartrate, etc. There are many ways to pay attention to the breath. Go through all of them and explore what it feels like to breathe. I start at the tip of the nose, then feel the breath go through the whole body, then I chop it up. I go to the nose, then move attention to the throat areas, then to the top of the chest, the middle of the chest, then the left lung, the right lung, both lungs, then the belly, then everything together. I spend about 5 or 10 breaths at each area that I just listed, then I focus on the one that feels most comfortable.  When my mind is racing at the beginning, I focus on a bigger area like my belly. Once I get more calm, I'll bring the focus to a smaller area like my throat, and finally to my nose when the mind is really calm. \n\nAs you explore the breath in the body, notice how your mind will release its clinging to the idea that it needs to be in any one place and focus can be global and fluid or narrow and exclusive. Neither way is better or worse in and of itself, especially at first. Observing this for yourself in your own body is insight. That insight builds discernment which allows you the freedom and control to gently refocus yourself.\n\nLet your meditation be about that for now. Don't try to shotgun yourself into the jhana. It doesn't happen that way. Read my account to see what happened when I tried that. \n\nIn addition, this is a good time to learn about what exactly goes on in the mindfulness of breathing. The 16 steps of the practice are outlined in the [Anapanasati Sutta](http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.118.than.html). These are stages of developing the focus on the breath that one goes through. These stages aren't necessarily linear when experienced but they're plotted out that way in the text as a guideline to mastery.\n\nThe language might seem a bit archaic at first but let's have a look:\n\n[1] Breathing in long, he discerns, 'I am breathing in long'; or breathing out long, he discerns, 'I am breathing out long.' \n\n[2] Or breathing in short, he discerns, 'I am breathing in short'; or breathing out short, he discerns, 'I am breathing out short.' \n\n[3] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body.' \n\n[4] He trains himself, 'I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication.'\n\nNotice how important discernment is. In the beginning when we sit, we take in a few deep breaths to come to attention on the actual sensation of the breath entering and exiting the body. Notice EVERYWHERE in the body that this effects. Explore it. Notice the effect of trying to restrict the focus to any one place, notice the effect of the whole body without regard to any one place. \n\nGo through and feel it in the nose, then place your attention in the areas of the throat, then the areas of the chest, the middle of the chest, the lungs, the belly. See how these muscles effect your entire body as you breathe. Do you feel tension anywhere? What happens if you focus on that tension? Do you discern the contrast between focusing on the tension present versus focusing on the breath itself (where ever its strongest in your body)? \n\nIn terms of the [Anapanasati Sutta](http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.118.than.html):\n\n[1]\nThis is how you build discernment. First do it for breaths that come in long by purposefully breathing long. Discern the sensations of long and fast, long and slow, long breathing at medium speed. Discern these sensations in relation to the body as I've just said above.  \n\n[2]\nThen do this same thing for breaths that come in short. Make your breathing short on purpose. Short and fast, short and slow, short and medium speed. Discern them in relation to the body as you did the long breaths. Discern also the contrast between what you've learned about long breaths versus what short breaths feel throughout the body.\n\n[3]\nNow that you've done that and discerned the differences between long and short, let go of purposefully trying to control the speed or length of the breath and just allow your body to breathe. Now whatever breath comes in, discern it throughout the entire body.\n\nThe Buddha constantly uses a metaphor of a lute string being neither too tight nor too slack. This is the middle way. One has to adjust if something is too tight, or has to adjust if it is too slack. The only way to know how to adjust is to build discernment by exploring all of the aspects of the breath in the body, not just attaching to one brittle sensation at the expense of the whole of experience.\n\nEven all the way into the jhanas you constantly make finer and finer adjustments that lead to final Unbinding (Nirvana). \n\nMy final suggestion is when the hindrances arise (ill will, desire, sloth, restlessness, doubt), then your practice is advancing and it's time for you to learn about the five hindrances. [Gil Fronsdal's series talks](http://www.audiodharma.org/series/1/talk/1808/) are one of the most accessible, in depth and clear resources for learning about them.  \n\nI hope this helps.

{"body":"* Interesting.  When you mean:\n&gt;myself as the instrument and the practice itself as the artist.\n\nDo you basically mean that things happen automatically?  Is there an internal world?  Or do you just mean that sensate phenomenon flow, where mental sensations have a certain flow to them (by mental I mean internal and external sensations, because when doing this, they both seem to exhibit flow)?  Usually when I 'just sit' nowadays, there are flickering sensations, and I let them take me, so I let myself have thoughts about people, or get into conversations, or try to dissolve sensations, or concentrate on things, but it sees it's just part of the flow of sensations and these sensations stop after awhile on their own.  \n\nI'd actually be interested in what specific things you do in your practice:\n\n* Sit/walk?\n\n* eyes open/closed\n\n* focus on certain things (breadth, changing sensations, etc)\n\n* the more detailed the better.  \n\nPerhaps I can replicate what you're saying as well.  \n\n&gt;My only goals were to annihilate the ego, pierce the illusion of a separate self, and to usurp the pleasure/pain dichotomy as the ruling force in my life\n\n* That's pretty much what enlightenment is (at least from the vipassana perspective), seeing that all phenomenon are empty of a continuous, separate self.  The enlightenment they talk in the book doesn't eliminate the ego per se, you just notice that every sensation is just how it is, and it arises and disappears of it's own. It's not the elimination of the ego, it's realizing that the ego is just a multitude of sensations that 'you' don't identify with.  There are also insights into pain itself, where you notice that pain does not equal suffering.  I just throw it under the whole concentration/vipassana umbrella though.  Since at a certain point there is always a mixture of both, although you can focus to get into jhana or focus on sensations doing their thing.  What's interesting is that sensations of moving towards jhana or away from things are also just sensations.  Another interesting result of this is that the person who thinks about your friends, (thoughts themselves), are a very different person than the sensations which actually hang out with your friends.  There is some agreement, but it seems memory is just a memory about certain key events.      \n* Yea, the inner gaze is fulfilling to an extent.  With arahantship, the sensation of seeking is seen to be just another sensation and 'seeking' stops.  However this outward gaze (PCE mode) seems to eliminate the internal world, at least temporarily.  And if you relax a bit, it's not seeking anything at all.  You just do things.

{"body":"Day 15: 7 minutes.\n\nSunday 8/15/2010 was my first sit in several days. Work has been very tough on me this week, and I've discovered that meditation is actually strenuous mental work, not just an opportunity to relax. I am, however, quite committed to meditating every day despite my failures.\n\nHere are three thoughts on which I would be interested your comments:\n\n* I received the \"Mindfulness in Plain English\" by Bhante Gunaratana this week and had a false start reading (started, but didn't get far enough to matter). I woke with a clearer mind this morning and began again. The first three chapters are consistent with my previous understandings of meditation - except I had characterized meditation as a practice which is relaxing and brings more relaxation. I think I was confusing the concept of bliss with relaxation, which is somewhat misleading. Now that I recognize meditation as work, I am somewhat daunted because I am looking toward meditation to make my life less complex. I think the correct understanding is that meditation is a journey that will require much hard work, but it will make many other things seem as if they are not hard work, i.e. meditating will correct my perspective on the world.\n\n* My mind always seems groggy when I begin meditating. I don't know how to explain it, except I feel tired and have difficulty maintaining a meditative mind. This seems a little contrary to my daily life, where I generally feel sharp minded. I begin with counting breaths, and as embarrassing as it is to say it, I have actually forgotten what I'm doing a few times. After ~20 breaths things seem to clear up quite a bit and I seem to have a clearer mind. I thought his was my own flaw until I re-examined [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/30daysit/comments/cvu7n/my_first_real_experience_with_meditation/c0w0wch) comment and now I believe my mind simply needs some time to calm down - is this accurate?\n\n* When I begin my sit, I close my eyes with lots of anxiety and stress. My longstanding coping mechanism is to identify several of my top stressors and take action to reduce their impact. (i.e. if a project is stressing me, so I write a time-line to accomplish the project and complete the first few steps). While I'm meditating, this coping mechanism tends to creep into my thoughts repeatedly. It's weird, because this coping mechanism has been very helpful to me for several years, but now that I'm trying to look beyond it, it beckons me. While I was meditating this morning I inadvertently developed a \"nuts and bolts\" plan to reduce my stress today. I considered utilizing my coping mechanism to reduce stress before I meditate, but I'm concerned I'll lose my opportunity and get distracted by other tasks.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/NHUDS.jpg","subreddit_id":"t5_2ryuk","subreddit":"30daysit"}

I've even sometimes just let me thoughts roam free and bounce from one to another until the kind of just drop off and my thoughts slow down.

After I abolish these goals, I will most likely seek unbinding. You rock for sallying forth into the great mystery.\n* The inner gaze is the most profound strength and satisfaction I've yet known. As long as I understand outer searching as fruitless and distracting, I find I'm more forgiving and tolerant of any foray into the external world. As always, it takes mistakes -- and the awareness of those mistakes -- to find one's footing on the path again. \n\nGood shit. Thanks for the knowledge. Very satisfying to go back and forth in an ecumenical exchange like this. Perhaps because on some intuitive level I have great respect for the Vipassana, though I haven't begun asked for its teachings just yet.

But subvocalization is a sign I've left that state. Well, subtle mind ever-present but the voice/dialogue is what reminds me I haven't built up the concentration to abide there. \n* Maybe your 'Dark Night territory' is the same thing as my dung heap. When life hands me a huge, steaming, eye-watering pile of dung ... I welcome it gladly into my life. Especially if that dung takes the form of betrayal or any other major emotional trauma. It's important to be there with the shit because understanding is the first step in setting about planting a flower garden. \n* Thought for me is a sign I'm not fully present in the subtler aspects of mind. Normally thinking just reminds me to steer back into mindfulness of the present moment. However, if a thought, especially a negative one crops up again and again, it's usually a sign that I had better turn and acknowledge it. Name it. Ask where it comes from. Tell it that I'm grateful it's here. Ask to take down any messages it may have for me. Otherwise the thought can get stronger and stronger until it violently hijacks my zazen.

I don't, though. Ultimately, it depends on one's school and it's beliefs. My practice is very realist. I/we look at it this way: the intention is to continue mindful practice, always. Sitting in zazen helps reinforce that; a type of exercise that should continue to benefit the mind long after the body has stood up, extinguished the incense, and rolled up the sleeves for work. The best way I've ever described it (and, unfortunately, the most Yoda-like) is this: Practice matters not \"when\".

{"body":"Again, sorry for the confusion.  The format I took with the initial post was, if I do X, then Y will happen.  It seems you're mentioning a few different practices at once, which might be confusing the matter.  \n\n&gt;I freaking love walking meditation\n\n:-) If you want to get into what I call PCE mode, it seems the best way I've found is to walk barefoot and look at the outside world in childlike way, and just frolick around in nature.  If the world gets very clear, and colors seem more vivid and 'shiny', and the internal world effectively disappears, you're in it.  \n\n&gt;We literally become the food we eat, the people we entertain, the shows we watch on the television.\n\nThere are different types of nonduality.  I've noticed a few different ones, but here's a short list:\n\n- There is merging with the object, the sensations of 'you' and the sensations of the 'object' seem to merge into one thing.  Which seems to me a more concentration approach.  \n- From a vipassana perspective, the duality itself is its own sensation. \n\nBy \"Z perspective\", I mean that I'm using some of those techniques to do look at the mind a certain way.  \n\n&gt;But at the moment it seems that eyes closed is better quality for observing the workings of the mind.\n\nI agree, eyes closed is better for getting into the introspective world.  However, I'll give you a little trick: notice the sensations of the outside world and notice how they pop into awareness and disappear. ;-) \n\n&gt;My zen instructor stresses that we should move toward doing away with anchors like the breath and eventually perceive mind in mind, thoughts in thoughts, sense objects in sense objects.\n\nThat's essentially vipassana right there.  Different traditions have different techniques, but that's pretty much the results you're looking for.  \n\n&gt; Ah, the Nike teachings. Strap on those size 10's, and Just Do It.\n\nI was talking about a very specific form of 'just do it'. ;-).  From the PCE mode, it seems that your external behavior seems to happen on it's own.  You walk wherever you walk for example.  In this particular instance, I'm not talking about how the internal world operates, because from this perspective there is none.  \n\n&gt;I got into the practice of Zazen because I was an empiricist, an atheist, and zen was the least compromising and least devotional of the flavors of Buddhism\n\nPretty much the same reason I got interested in Buddhism.  I have problems in particular with Zen because they don't spell things out in a very clear manner (koans, bah :-P), however I like their atheism and need of very little belief.  If you read some of my comment history, you'll get an idea of my particularly brand of empiricism. :-P \n\n&gt;I've heard that Vipassana emphasizes looking deeply. If you practice this technique, have you encountered anything like a \"deeper\" layer of the mind? \n\nWell maybe, vipassana's focus is to see things as they are right now.  From that perspective, there are no deeper levels of mind, since the sensations you experience now are it. \n\nHowever, if you take a hybrid approach, the ability to 'penetrate' sensations which is something you learn with vipassana can get you into deeper concentration states.  Sit eyes closed, and slowly spread your focus, notice the sensations that make up the 'edge' of your awareness, and then penetrate those, soon those will disappear and you'll experience boundless space.  If you then focus on the sensations of 'space' then you'll penetrate those leading to even deeper states. ","subreddit_id":"t5_2ryuk","subreddit":"30daysit"}

You feel joy arise from this. \n\nThe goal of the 4 frames of reference is to develop discernment to such a high degree that as you go on in daily life you're able to make skillful choices, ones that don't engage in pulling you back into (or \"feeding\") the five hindrances. \n\nJhanas themselves are impermanent and only last while you meditate. The lessons learned in stilling what are called \"mental effluents\" and abandoning the five hindrances (Buddhist jargon) are then carried out in daily life.

But the other day at the temple my instructor said something, a quote from Shantideva (?). Basically, there are a thousand predatory people in the world that surrounds us. In order to snuff them out we must kill the predatory thought within us. It reminded me of the story behind the [Metta Sutta](http://mettarefuge.wordpress.com/2010/08/07/the-karaniya-metta-sutta-and-healing-through-loving-kindness/), where the monks were trying to practice in the forest but the local evil spirits were bothering them. They went to the Buddha for advice and he gave them the discourse on loving-kindness. The monks went back to the forest to practice the teaching and their whole situation changed. The spirits were moved by the monks' compassion, and ended up building them a safe haven to practice. While I cannot speak for the supernatural, I can wholeheartedly confirm the Metta Sutta's general blueprint for turning the hostility of the world into a place of safety. It blows my mind sometimes.

{"body":"I've been through a few sits where my breath would get so uncomfortable that I would just stop and then get pissed for the rest of the day.\r\n\r\nSometimes, I noticed especially after going through thoughts of hate and of being wronged, my diaphragm would get tensed and pulled upwards and it would affect my breathing adversely. Each breath would feel incomplete and I'd feel as if I'm being starved of oxygen even though I know it is not true, that I'm fine and it is just a mental impression of it. I would try to fix my posture and relax my belly but usually the diaphragm wouldn't respond in kind and I'd be stuck with chest breathing instead of belly breathing. Chest breathing tires me out pretty quickly, so whenever that happens I'd have to resort to distractions (like reading books, surfing the internet or just plain old napping) to relax my diaphragm.\r\n\r\nSometimes the entire breathing meditation would go very smoothly but the concentration would be so fine tuned that I can sense every bump and irregularity of my breath in the nostril and it would keep breaking my rhythm of the in and out breath. I would have so much expectation of how my breath should be and how the bumps would refuse to occur at the same intervals but instead would happen randomly and every time it happens I would be frustrated and that feeling of frustration accumulates and turned into full blown self hatred. I'd try to keep the frustration in check but sometimes nothing I can do in terms of changing my attitude towards the breath can calm the discomfort. Usually I'd just stop then and get off the cushion because my mind would find someone to blame for the discomfort and generate a lot of hatred in the process.\r\n\r\nThat's about it.

{"body":"30-40 minutes. I didn't use a timer or bell. Yesterday I was so eager to go into jhana that I fueled the hindrances more than concentration. Today, I separated out the experiences of bodily and mental fabrications in that order. So many of the mental processes have a strong effect on the body if we pay attention. The moment I discern it in the body, I refocus on the breath and this can require quite a bit of ardency. As I do this I simultaneously pay attention to the effect that this attention has on reducing the bodily fabrications and increasing calm concentration. \n\nThis is what I mean by \"discernment\". I notice that attention on one thing or another amplifies it at the expense of something else. For example, attention to bodily fabrication amplifies the sensation of those fabrications **at the expense of** attention to the breath and the ease coming from placing attention on the breath. I'd keep cycling through this and splitting things up into finer and finer distinctions up until I ended mental chatter and calmed the mental fabrications themselves. Rather than going into jhana, I kept the attention firmly into remaining concentrated in calmness/samatha. Tricky things arise here and it's important to experience how slippery it can get. I'm satisfied to remain here for a while and build the strength of concentration. \n\nThat's all for now. ","subreddit_id":"t5_2ryuk","subreddit":"30daysit"}

Sometimes if I've had a tough day I'll sit right when I get home from work before I cook dinner.\n\nI have a dedicated yoga and meditation space in my \"office\". The yoga space faces a wall of mirrors and on the opposite side of the room is my altar and sitting space. I sit on a Smile Cushion (by Carolina Designs) which allows me to sit for up to an hour with no issues in the legs. The space is carpeted so I have no need for a zabuton. I currently sit in sukhasana (Easy or Burmese pose) but am getting closer to half lotus. My altar has images of my teacher, Krishna, Jesus, Buddha (small and large), an ankh, and close friends and family. I have agarbhati (incense) from India of a few types and only burn it occasionally as it fills the space very quickly and I don't like to breathe it in too much. \n\nThe room is generally dark, in the morning there is dawn light, in the evening I have one of those himalyan salt lamps to provide gentle light. \n\nI always do yoga and meditate in silence as I so rarely experience silence throughout my day.

{"body":"2 of 5.  40 min. I was intent to stay strictly with the breath. I went through the first 4 stages of anapanasati sequentially because that seems to get my mind focused and then increase the focus by the 4th step. Once the bodily fabrications are calmed, it creates a physical sense of joy. \n\nThe only way to explain this is that \"calming the bodily fabrications\" doesn't mean to suppress them. It means to seriously be intent to let them be there while your primary focus is on the breath. To GET the focus on the breath, you have to \"train yourself\" to do it. There is a strong element of will in steps 3 and 4. The breath with take over your awareness and everything else going on will relate to that as your frame of reference. \n\nI gave rise to joy in this way:  Not giving a shit about anything other than \"being delighted in vigilance\", meaning learning to be excited about how powerful simply staying with the breath really is by experiencing it. When sensual desire arose in the form of pleasant thoughts, [it was a trap](http://friendsoftheprogram.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/its-a-trap.jpg)! I experience it in the body as loosening of the posture, crookedness, the head tilting upward, irregularity of the breathing, drifting off into a diffuse fuzz.. \n\nWhen sensual desire came up as craving, it was due to having a delusion about how the experience I was craving SHOULD BE, rather than letting the experience unfold and delighting in that process. I experienced this as a type of heat in the body, a flushness of the skin, accompanied by a feeling of constriction. \n\nRegarding aversion to pain, the aversion itself is a hindrance. When pain arose (right now I'm in a great deal of discomfort due to some skin infection.. gross) one strategy was to forcefully stay on the breath as a means of blotting it out. This constricted my mind, constricted my sense of space, constricted my breath, constricted the muscles around my eyes and caused my body to sweat. \n\nToo little energy/focus on the breath, though, threw me into a whirlwind of aversion. I experimented between these two extremes and found that what I was looking at was the arising of the hindrances. This allowed me to let the hindrances stay there just as pain stays with you as you breath. Noticing them as the hindrances, giving them the space to be (not clinging, not averse), and refocusing on the breath caused them to dissolve. This also caused my sense of space or mind to \"open\" and become relaxed and enlarged. This gave rise to joy.\n\nNow I need to get a fucking doctor's appointment for tomorrow.  :)  Sorry for the long post. This sit was important and I had to recount all the steps of how I got there.

{"body":"Thomson Reuters is a company that provides information to a wide range of clients\u2014lawyers, accountants, scientists, reporters, broadcasters and a host of others. I even have seen Ministry of Finance using it for their financial data reports. For the most part, they have nothing in common but the need to get information. Providing that information is what Thomson Reuters is all about. Thomson Reuters calls itself \u201cthe world\u2019s leading provider of \u2018intelligent information\u2019 for businesses and professionals.\u201d To live up to that billing, they need to do more than simply deliver search engine results, a lot more. They pull distributed information together; they analyze the information first to ensure it is what the customer wants; and they provide methods of data delivery and retrieval that help their customers get what they want.\n\nThey have a hybrid solution using walled garden (closed environment) as well as an open garden services for the community to access the information such as their twitter . As you know, there are many limitations using Twitter. It has no applications rather than other sites like Facebook, Friendster and MySpace. It also has no groups, videos, blogs, classified ads, forums, marketplace and other unique and popular social networking menus. You can only upload one picture, which is your avatar and must be small, compare to other social networks which you can upload pictures as many as you want. You also cannot upload music files here on Twitter, but you can upload on the other social networks.\n\nFor their premium customers (pay business model), the system works this way:\n1. A customer accesses the Thomson Reuters information service, which can be a web application or a Windows-based application.\n2. Once a search is initiated, that request is passed to the Thomson Reuters intranet to the Thomson Reuters Web Plus service layer.\n3. The service layer begins two actions concurrently: It applies its custom business logic to the request, culling relevant information from it.\n4. The service layer returns the information to the client.","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3rt","subreddit":"346class10week7"}

{"body":"Drop the music.  It's completely unnecessary.  99.9% of the people you'll be sending your reel out to will be playing it without sound.  Of that remaining .1%, at least half of them will not like the music.  A demo reel is not the place to show off what kind of music you like.  \n\n\nThat said, the content of the reel doesn't really show much that is impressive.  I don't mean to sound harsh here, but critiques are a HUGE part of improving as an artist, and so this should not be taken as an insult, but rather, something to learn from.\n\n\nModeling:\n\n1.  The model designs aren't all that inspiring.  There's really nothing that jumps out as being really unique, clever, fun, or anything like that.  They're just very \"meh\".\n\n2.   Along the lines of the model design, they're very simple.  There's really no complex forms here.  I'm not really seeing anything that shows a firm of grasp of edge loops, etc.  That's not to say you lack such skillsets, just that I'm not seeing them here.\n\n3.  Another problem with the model designs is that in the turntable renders, you're only showing them in the standing straight up, arms outstretched pose.  That's all fine and well, but you really should either ALSO show a natural pose, or scrap the arms out pose for a more natural one.  Take the guy with the big tanks on his back for example.  The character design would be helped so much by simply hunching him over.  Show him in his natural pose.  Show him struggling to carry such a heavy burden.  \n\nThe brain creature suffers from this problem too.  That vertical pose just totally ruins it.  \n\nTexturing:\n\n1.  Everything is way too flat.  And \"smooth/shiny\".  Try incorporating some spec/reflect/diffuse/etc maps to break up the surfaces a bit. Everything is waaay too uniform.  Fur, hair, skin, cloth, etc, should not have the same properties.\n\n2.  Maybe try and play around with some fur or hair simulation or something as well.  \n\n3.  Textures/surfaces/materials and models compliment each other.  You need to work on them both to bring out the best in each other.  You should also be showing your various maps (and UVs) with the models.  \n\n4.  Sort of related to the above, but also fits in with the modeling - you have only shown the sculpts without showing the base mesh and displacement/normal maps.  It's not necessarily crucial to show the base mesh and displacement/normal maps, but if you're creating a model for animation, you should include them.  \n\n\nAnimation:\n\n1.  Not seeing much here in terms of good timing, proper weighting, and it's all sort of very jerky and clunky feeling.\n\n2.  In terms of timing, take a look at the campfire scene, when the \"monster\" (or whatever it is) takes the food and throws it into his mouth.  It's all too quick.  It's all too jerky.  This would be more expected of a smaller creature.  Not something twice the size of a man.  Same goes with the spear bit when he's thrashing around with the spear stuck in him.\n\n3.  The end of the animation part really highlights and shows a major problem with your animation in general.  When the guy does the \"facepalm\", it's all very.... stiff.  The additional body movements do not seem natural at all.  It's almost like they were tossed in there just because you expect the rest of the body to move, without understanding why or how to accomplish it properly.  The same thing with the guy bending over and side to side towards the end of the reel.\n\n\n\nGeneral stuff:\n\nAs convocator said, don't put the speed paints in.  Also, you misspelled speed.  You spelled it \"spead\".  You really should be proof-reading what little text is there.  To not do so comes off as sloppy.  Anyway, a demo reel should be your very best work.  Don't add things in just to increase the duration of it.  Put your best stuff first.  You need to capture their attention.  Most demo reels are turned off after the first few seconds (or within the first minute).  Don't try and wow them by saving your best for last.\n\n\nAnd again, I'm not saying this to be a dick, but you need to look at your work and ask yourself a couple of things:\n\n**Is this the best work I can do?**\n\n**How does it compare to other works I've seen?**\n\n\nCombine those to ask yourself if you should really be showing off your work at this point in time and shopping your reel around.  By all means show off your work, and even make demo reels for personal use to track your progress if you like, but until you're really comfortable with sending it off to studios, hold off.  Now, you might be extremely happy with the work you've done, but you need to take a long, hard, critical and objective look at your work.  This can be hard for artists.  They're often either their own worst critic, or they extremely proud of the time and effort they've put in.  In either case, they're not necessarily viewing their work with the required objectiveness and critical analysis that needs to be applied.\n\nIn terms of comparing your work to others, do not be afraid to try and copy another artist's work (but also don't feel compelled to do so).  It can be a good learning experience.  Sometimes trying to \"copy\" another artist's work can give you insight into how others work, and this can improve yourself.  (Obviously, just don't try and pass it off as your own unique creative vision or some such).\n\n\nI don't know how to say this without sounding a like a dick, so I'm just gonna be out with it:  Your work looks like something that might pass for OK 10+ years ago with mid range software.  With the abundance of tools, and the quality of tools out there, there's just so much more potential to be had.  There's also an abundance of quality training available out there these days, especially in the video training department.  Of course, all the tools and software out there won't magically make up for skill, but it certainly can make the artist's job easier.  It looks like something you might expect in a very low budget children's show or video game.  The reason I say this, is because you have to ask yourself if you're okay with that.

I have never done it this way, however I'm going to try it next time.  there is a way to retopo in zbrush and it apparantly works very well.  \n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Fdog0y9jVQ  \n\nthen you can also use zbrush to unwrap and generate the normals.  however I've never done it this way.\n\nthe way I'm doing it now is I export the high poly into 3ds max, and use the graphite modeling tools to create the low poly.  the graphite modeling tools allow you to create polygons right on the surface of the high poly model.  it's really convenient and nice, I know for a fact that maya has something similar but I can't for the life of me remember what it is called.  anyways make sure that when you create the low poly models you use proper edge loops to make it animate correctly.  if you do it correctly you can make the low poly look almost as good as the high.  \n\nas for your next question the way to get your normal map, this is for 3ds max and don't know how you would do it in maya, but maybe it will help.  \n\n1.  open up the render to texture window\n2.  make sure the low poly mesh is selected, and the high poly is directly on top of the low poly.\n3.  turn on enable projection.\n4.  pick the high poly model as the source\n5.  choose normals map in the map slot\n6.  pick the size of the map 1024 x 1024 should be the minimum size you go.\n7.  create a path.\n8.  render/bake your normals.  if there is any red in the render then that means it did not get the height information (was outside of the cage) you can fix this by moving the verts on the projection cage.\n9.  if the render is correct, you can apply it by creating a material, put the normal map in the bump channel as a normal bump.  turn it up to 100 or a bit higher, and apply the map to the low poly.  \n\nviola your low poly looks like a million polys.  then rig and have fun!","subreddit_id":"t5_2r4ei","subreddit":"3DMA"}

{"body":"Hey\n\nSo there are a couple basic ways you could do this.\n\n1. Select your eye objects and then parent them to the Biped Head object (using the Select and Link tool)  This will make the eyes a Child of the biped head, and will follow along with it exactly.\n\n2. Before you skin the model, select your body and attach the eyes to your mesh, so it is all one polygon object, that way when you skin the eyes will move with it, later on you can get fancier with this by adding in bones to control the eyes, with look at constraints to control the direction.\n\nThose are the two simplest, i personally would do option 2, as i come from the games industry it's just how we handle things.  With that option though I can add in bones to control the eyes with look at constraints (always have them looking at an object i can control later).  And have those bones control others to deform the area around the eyes. For just a simple animation as what you're doing, linking them to the head would be easy.

However, you'll have to adjust the levels and masking of each layer for it to look right.\n\n\nI took a shot at it here: http://i.imgur.com/YaIRJ.png (If you rendered and saved the image in a 32-bit format, you won't get the banding by the sun that I got.)","subreddit_id":"t5_2rlfs","subreddit":"3dsmax"}

The way the tutorial explains adding direction to the eyes is by adding a simple texture of a white background with a black circle in the centre and using the material editor to add it to a sphere.

{"body":"@skylercloud222 - I have seen a lot of people come right out of college to do great work. I think the problem is people graduate and just go \"give me a job now\". Bad Bad mentality. You said \"You pretty much need a good network and years of experience to land anything in this economy.\" is totally wrong. In this economy what studios want are snipers. They want a guy to come in get the job done fast and right. So my suggestion is to keep learning and working on your core area of expertise. You seem to sound like while you were looking you weren't looking for an internship. Get on that! An internship is worth its weight in GOLD! Speaking from experience here.\n\nWhen a student gets out into the industry he is no longer competing with other students. He or She is now up against everyone in the world. So take your site and really look at the work you have and put it up against the talent out there right now. You are up against veterans that might have taken a break for a vacation or someone between contracts. Hell, you are also up against artists at big shops that might even be looking to transfer cities or companies. So yes you are up against EVERYONE.\n\n@Omeba9401 - You don't need a package to take you into the field, you need talent and drive. The software doesn't make an artist. Its just a pencil. So if you want to use blender use blender who cares. Some studios are picky about packages but they will always talk to you if they see core artistic merit. And a good studio will train you in the package they need.\n\nThose are my two cents!\n\nand the comment below from rad_thundercat is a REALLY good suggestion.

{"body":"You can use the eye dropper tool to load it up into the select material port in the material editor off of the model, it's a multi/sub-object material.\n\nThe material is rather complicated with 87 layers it looks like. Unfortunately all the links for where the textures go were broken when this was exported as an fbx. I'm sure there is a way to export so the maps are in place, but I don't have light wave so I can't help you there.\n\nAlso you could just manually go in between lightwave material and 3ds max and place the maps where they need to go. But there are a mix of opacity maps and such so that may prove to difficult. If this was a model you unwrapped and textured that wouldn't be to hard but that's not the case.\n\nOne other thing I noticed was that unwrapping looks funny in max. Some of the verts are outside of the workable area in the uvw editor, so I dont know if that will cause issues when you try to apply the maps. \n\nFiguring out how to export the model from lightwave so it doesn't lose the mapping would be the best solution. Other than that I'd recommend on just making a new material. You could use a material from : http://www.mrmaterials.com/component/remository/?func=select&amp;id=2. The downside is you wont have the cool details like the emblems and pin striping. But a nice metallic material may look cool.\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2rlfs","subreddit":"3dsmax"}

I haven't played with this so I don't know if it's what your looking for. \n\nAlso you could try experimenting with geometry that has self-illumination. That way you can make whatever shape you want as the light source. I've done this with success before, I've even applied materials to single polys on an object to have them act as a light source.\n\nHopefully these solutions are in the ballpark of what your trying to accomplish.

{"body":"our D was very good today. ryan just threw one TD ... it's offensively where we sucked hard (no surprises there)!","subreddit_id":"t5_2rebv","subreddit":"49ers"}
{"body":"Carr was just as bad in preseason as he was yesterday. I wanted Alex Smith benched after he had those horrible turnovers that lost several games. Having looked at the stats now, and analyzed the situation the 49ers are in it's clear this is a coaching problem, not just a QB problem.\n\nCarr's stats are lousy across the board, he's thrown more INTs then TDs and any Texan fan can tell you he is not a good quarterback. If Carr wasn't taking reps or showing promise in practice I'm baffled to why Singletary nearly put him in the game a few weeks ago, or even why he is still the number 2. Again, a coaching issue.\n\nAs for my research, Troy Smith was the 2006 Heismen Trophy winner who had an average QB rating of 159.72 in college. In the few games he has played in the NFL he's thrown 3 touchdowns to 1-INT with a QB rating of 79.7. He likely would have been the starter for the Ravens had he not gotten sick giving Flacco a chance which ultimately got Flacco the job. His biggest downside is that he is 6'0 tall, although he weighs 217 (the same weight of Alex Smith who is 6'4), but he can also run the ball.\n\nNate Davis also put up impressive stats in college, and is 6'2 at 226lbs. His biggest downside is that he is dyslexic, and is supposedly not a very good practice player. However, his preseason appearance's have been impressive, and he can accurately throw a 60+ yard pass. Rumor has it the reason Singletary doesn't like Nate Davis because he would call audibles at the line if he didn't like the play called by the coaches. Granted, when he did call his own plays he accurately read defenses, and made plays. He's more of a gunslinger instinct driven QB, which is the reason I compared him to Brett Farve. Farve is also known for being inaccurate and sloppy during practice, but brings it come game day.\n\nOf course, Alex Smith was a decent college QB with 47 touchdowns to only 8-INTs. In the NFL his QB rating is around 70 with 45 TDs to 52 INTs. Being a decent college QB unfortunately doesn't translate to being a good NFL player, however in a spread offense Smith has proven to be much more successful, especially in the redzone. I recognize that most teams in the NFL would gladly trade their 1st string QB for Alex Smith, as any good coach would play to his strengths and not force him into a power run offense who tries to play protection with 3 or 7 point leads.\n\nWith Smith injured, I'd rather see what Troy or Nate can do then endure the shit storm that is David Carr's NFL career.","subreddit_id":"t5_2rebv","subreddit":"49ers"}

{"body":"Ick sorry for the typo, the article wouldn't let me copy and paste, had to type out the quote.\n\nAnyhow, I think this has been a major issue all season. Any team with a decent coaching staff watches our films, and figures out the various tells from our offense. This is the 3rd or 4th time I've read a quote from an opposing team after playing the 49ers stating they knew exactly what kind of play the 49ers were calling.\n\nThis would also explain why no matter what Troy Smith did yesterday the Bucs had the offense figured out. Troy looked bewildered after several failed plays, and I think the reason why was because he couldn't figure out why or how they knew what play the 49ers were running every single time.\n\nThe linebacker mentioned Frank Gore specifically, and I've noticed when it's a running play he tends to lean into it. If the Kanas City Chiefs, and Bucs can figure this out, pretty much any half decent coach or player can. I think this simply reiterates the poor coaching of the 49ers. They need to watch the film and look at what tells and giveaways our team is doing and coach those players not to do those things, or hell teach them how to mislead the other team.\n\nThis is clearly on the coaching staff, Singletary needs to be fired. We don't even need a good coach, we just need someone better than Singletary.\n\nAs my Dad put it, \"I never got excited once during that game, it was probably the worst football game I've ever seen.\" This is coming from a guy who's seen pretty much every 49er game in the last 30 years.","subreddit_id":"t5_2rebv","subreddit":"49ers"}

I'm not saying Carr is good, he's just not as bad as most people think.(I hope)\r\n\r\nMy personal opinion is that Nate DAvis was put on the practice squad because Alex was probably very nervous about him getting pulled if he sucked, so to appease Alex, Dingleberry put Nate on the practice squad (knowing nobody would pick him up because of his dyslexia it would take him 2-3 years to learn an offensive scheme) I think his dyslexia is a non-issue in this case because he's had 2 years in the system and dyslexic people can learn, just differently and take a little longer.\r\n\r\nAlex was good in the spread, which the 49ers do not run.

{"body":"I may be downvoted, or hated for saying this, but Frank Gore is not the end all be all for the 49ers. Brian Westbrook is an amazing running back (he was the Eagles offense for many years), and Anthony Dixon is a good powerback for a rookie. With Gore out of the lineup we're going to pass more, use more screens, and plays to take advantage of Westbrooks quick agility. Gore is an amazing power running back, but Westbrook is quicker, and has better feet. The Westbrook touchdown last night was a perfect example of just how quick his feet are, had Gore been in that play he would have tried to run through the defensive player, and likely would have been down at the 1. Westbrook was able to out maneuver him, and get in for the touchdown.\n\nAlex Smith and Frank Gore getting injured may just be the best thing to happen to the 49ers this year. It's forcing Singletary out of his comfort zone, and enabling guys like Troy Smith, Westbrook, Crabtree, and Morgan to make plays, and win games.","subreddit_id":"t5_2rebv","subreddit":"49ers"}

","subreddit_id":"t5_2rebv","subreddit":"49ers"}
{"body":"Quote:\nOFFENSE: B-\nAlex Smith's best game as a pro. Really a series of signature moments on the game-tying TD drive and 2 pt conversion. Great protection for him all night from the O line -- no sacks allowed. Frank Gore was an absolute monster. Running and receiving for almost 170 yds, he was the Niners best weapon. Vernon Davis got down field for a huge catch plus the 2 pt conversion, and Josh Morgan looked very good.\n\nThe knocks come from what could have been. First, the Crabtree Conundrum. It's a difficult problem on any team when your most talented player is questioned by others - for injury, attitude, or anything else. If he continues with 1-catch nights, the questions are going to mount. It's already obvious after 2 games that showing up during the preseason may have been a good idea for the team. Secondly, the effectiveness of Alex Smith was majorly displayed on the game tying drive. We saw it last year during comebacks, when the pace of the offense picked up so did Alex Smith's passer rating. He just seems better when the pace is hot. He's not a drop back pocket passer, and has seemed at home scrambling. It never looked like he was rushing on the final drive. He gets the ultimate football compliment: the drive was very Joe-like.\n\nThe major knock on the offense came from earlier in the game, when the Niners gave the ball away twice near the end zone. Filed in the \"most overused phrases in football\" file, you just can't turn the ball over and hope to win.\n\nDEFENSE: B-\nThey didn't create any turnovers, which has been a problem. Bush ran free most of the game, but they held Brees under 300 yards, and only the late 30 yd catch by Colston picking on Goldson (most appropriate Niner Name ever) separated them from OT. Most importantly, the defense tightened up when needed, nearly overcoming the turnovers. And when it counted most near the goal line, the Niners defense held the Saints to a FG, leading to the Alex Smith moments down the stretch. The run defense was stout... allowing only 50 yards on the ground, 2.1 per carry.\n\nThe negative is the last taste in our mouths. They allowed Brees to go 51 yards to set up the winner. He dinked and dunked and then found Colston. A shame after a solid Monday night effort.\n\nOVERALL: B+\nThe Stats on games where 1 team turns it over 4 times and the other team turns it over 0 must be about 1,000 victories for the team that didn't turn it over, and no wins for the team that turned it over. Yet.......... there we were: One nearly blocked, knuckling, ugly pig of an awkwardly spinning field goal separating the Niners from going OT with the Who Dat Champs. So they must have done something right.\n\nSo close, so close, so close. Within an hour of the game on Monday the words \"moral victory\" were thrown around 100 times. And just as many times, someone said: There's no such thing as a moral victory in the NFL. Actually, those people are very wrong. Maybe there's no such thing as a \"good loss\", but in the Niners case this game was definitely a moral victory.\n\nPainful? Yes. Disappointing? Yes. One they'd love to have had? Yes. One they had counted on winning before the season? No. That was the previous week against the Seattle. Against a team that the Niners should just beat. This was a gutty performance, a put-your-season-on-the-line performance. And they came up just short. A few seconds short. And after watching the winning kick over and over and over.... a few inches short, too. A blocked field goal there leads to OT. Maybe Alex Smith gets his hands on the ball first and wins the game. We'll never know.\n\nBut what you do know is how you felt this week compared to last week. Last week the Niners looked like a bunch of quitters. This week they looked like a group of winners. They just didn't win.\n\nhttp://blogblitz.nfl.com/san-francisco-49ers/entry/week_2_report_card","subreddit_id":"t5_2rebv","subreddit":"49ers"}

Mays also has some potential, and Goldson has his moments.\n\nOn offense, Lupati is a beast, Vernon Davis is a beast, Crabtree has great hands, Ziegler is decent, Morgan is decent, and Ginn has some moves. Westbrook in my opinion is also the better running back, better pass protector, and better receiver. I mean Gore has 4 fumbles this season so far, and hasn't broken for a major gain since preseason. Anthony Davis makes way too many rookie mistakes, but then again the kids 20 years old. Who the hell drafts a 20 year old? The rest of the o-line is pretty awful.\n\nThen there's Alex Smith. The best worst quarterback in the league. When he's not throwing interceptions, or fumbling the ball, he leads you to believe he's a decent enough quarterback, leads impressive opening drives, his stats are impressive in the redzone, comes back from deficits, but when the games on the line he folds under pressure and throws another INT.\n\nAs for the coaching, I don't know what to say. I really do not believe Singletary is a horrible coach, he's just not a great coach. I mean special teams has improved significantly, they drafted some good picks, picked up Westbrook, and fired Raye. He's actually made some decent decisions given what he has to work with. The defense is good enough, it's just when they're on the field all game they eventually get beat, and that's all it takes for teams to beat us, and honestly that falls on our offenses inability to score points, and turning over the ball more so then anything else.\n\nOn the other hand, if we had Brett Farve, Brady, or Breeze as our QB we would be 5-0 right now.

The more we spread the field, the better chance we have at breaking runs on the outside with Westbrook, then nailing it in with Dixon on short yardage situations. If I see another 3rd and long run play I think I'm going to throw up.\n\nThe Westbrook / Dixon combo will likely bring new dimension to our run game, and offense. Despite Gore being 40% of our offense, we've been losing. I'm not saying he isn't a great player, but that's too much to put on any single player, and it is not smart football. We need to establish the passing game so we can keep Green Bays d-line honest. I mean this is a team that's given up maybe 30 points in their last 3 games. Matthews is a beast, and makes Patrick Willis look like an equal. We're gong up against one of the better defenses in the league right now, and although their offense has spurted a bit this year, Rogers has the ability to spread the field at any moment and take the lead.\n\nI fear the biggest problem against the matchup against the Packers is our shitty pass rush. Aaron Rogers has the weirdest mechanics of a quarterback I've seen in a while, he does this weird little hop when he passes but it gives him a really quick release, and a level of unpredictability. With our horrible pass rush, I really don't see us getting to the quarterback. Although Clements, Adams, and Reggie Smith have been playing better I'm still not very confident in them. Also in the last two games we've given up two big plays when Spikes is set to cover an eligible receiver down the field.

{"body":"It's almost like the coaching staff doesn't realize the speed of the NFL today. The players today are bigger, stronger, and faster then they've ever been. It is a different game today then in the 80's and 90's. Our core coaching staff is old school in ideology and we simply get beat when we play faster teams. We try to eat up clock and slow the game down, but in today's NFL you only need a minute to score these days.\n\nToday our oline was destroyed, Anthony Davis made a few rookie mistakes, and that personal foul was uncalled for. The running game didn't happen, and the play calling never adjusted to open up the field. \n\nOur use of Westbrook was laughable at best, not because he did anything wrong, it was simply that the plays he was involved in where horrible. I mean seriously, we have two of the best running backs in the league and we don't even run splitbacks, and plays that take advantage of that fact.\n\nCould you imagine a d having to cover Crabtree, Davis, Gore, Westbrook, and Morgan?\n\nAlex Smith's only plays well when the oline is giving him time, and picking up blitzes. He's getting a little better at scrambling but usually puts too much on the ball, and over throws or guides receivers into being tackled or out of bounds.\n\nI was mostly disappointed with the defense. I mean Clemens our corner was dissecting plays and making more tackles then Patrick Willis. The Chiefs somehow we're able to couch around Patrick Willis the entire game. They simply almost never ran in his direction or passed to any receivers he covered. The d was always a second too late in pretty much every aspect, pass rush, tackles, etc.\n\nAll of our losses were from being out coached, not out played.

{"body":"Here's the text (copied from [here](http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5893441/Acapor_leaked_emails)):\n&gt;To whom it concerns,\n&gt;\n&gt;Over the past years, we have borne witness to a technological revolution. The individual has become free, in the most extreme anarchistic sense, to share ideas. Some of these ideas are shared behind proxies, darknets, or similar \"closed doors\". Nevertheless, the ideas are out there. There have been similar instances of such revolutions of the mind. Their effects on society are inestimably great. As in past times with the invention of the printing press, so it is today that the people embrace this revolution, this new \"anarchy\" of freedom to share, while their autocratic rulers seek to crush this freedom. \n&gt;\n&gt;In spite of censorship in the form of copyright law and other restrictions, the people have succeeded in distributing content to the poor, the underprivileged and the oppressed. The most numerous pirates are Chinese, as content filters restrict a vast amount of information in their country. Pirates are also numerous among the poor, as this demographic cannot afford things like college books or entertainment. Indeed, while often ignored by those interested only in bread and circuses, a vast amount of educational literature is available to the everyday pirate online. Piracy democratizes knowledge and makes education affordable.\n&gt;\n&gt;History repeats itself. There was a time when powers that be attempted to silence the printing press, the blank cassette and the recordable CD. All of these previous attempts at censorship have failed, and future attempts of this nature are doomed to failure. Indeed, the sequestration of human knowledge for the benefit of extremist capitalism is treason against the whole of humanity. All should have the right to listen to a melody, experience a plot and learn from the aggregate of human knowledge available online.\n&gt;\n&gt;The man on the street already knows this. He knows it when he illegally [1] gives his unused software to a friend or acquaintance. He knows it when he gives that old college book to a person in need. However, he also knows that something is wrong.\n&gt;\n&gt;He knows that something is wrong when the artwork of little girls is raped in the name of copyright [2]. He knows that something is wrong when solicitors use copyright to blackmail thousands of people sharing information [3]. He knows that something is wrong when corrupt organizations seeking to stem the free flow of information lie through their teeth, produce false documents and spread misinformation about their opponents [4]. \n&gt;\n&gt;He knows that it is not right when his leaders inexplicably support massive capitalist enterprises over the majority opinion of their own people [5]. He know they are wrong when they use illegal means to get what they want, while hypocritically deprecating their opponents for doing the same [6].\n&gt;\n&gt;If one were to pursue the propaganda of various community-reputable organizations such as...\n&gt;\n&gt;    * The Motion Picture Association of America [MPAA]\n&gt;    * The Recording Industry Association of America [RIAA]\n&gt;    * The B. Phonographic Industry [BPI]\n&gt;    * The Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft [AFACT]\n&gt;    * Stichting Bescherming Rechten Entertainment Industrie Nederland [BREIN]\n&gt;\n&gt;...they would come across many a morality play suggesting that, if they 'pirate' a film or an album, they are depriving a simple artist, actor or crewmember of their rightful wage. This worker won't be able to break even for their next lot of groceries because the pirate robbed them of their money. \n&gt;\n&gt;Of course, these organizations carefully omit the fact that only a small percentage of the profits made by big media ever make it to those who actually produce it. Do they ever disclose how small of a percentage most script writers, novelists, etc., actually make? Of course not, and there is a reason why. Do these anti-piracy organizations truthfully disclose how much they receive in donations, and from whom? Of course not, and there is a reason for this also.\n&gt;\n&gt;In the end, our DDoS efforts have been compared to waiting for a train [7]. What must the people do to be heard? To what lengths must they go to have their pleads taken seriously? Must they to take to the streets with noose and handgun before those in power take notice? \n&gt;\n&gt;You are forcing our hand by ignoring the voice of the people. In doing so, you bring the destruction of your iron grip of information ever closer. You have ignored the people, attacked the people and lied to the people. For this, you will be held accountable before the people, and you will be punished by them.\n&gt;\n&gt;We will not stop.\n&gt;\n&gt;    We will not forget.\n&gt;\n&gt;        We will prevail.\n&gt;\n&gt;            We are anonymous.\n\n\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh4w","subreddit":"4chan"}

Almost everything that we have or do in today's society is derivative on the tens of thousands of years of people that came before us.  Thinking that something has to be secret in order to be special is just silly.","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh4w","subreddit":"4chan"}

{"body":"Naw, you can tell by the appearance of the skin: it's for realsies. See how the skin has a \"textured\" look to it? That's scabbing, and henna tats don't produce that as there's no breaking of the skin to scab over. Hennas work by mixing the powder of dried and sifted henna leaves with a mildly acidic liquid (commonly lemon juice) to produce a paste with a similar consistency to toothpaste, which is then smoothly applied to the skin. On the other hands, real tattoos inject pigment right into the skin, inciting an immune system response that prompts initial swelling and eventual peeling away of the damaged epidermis (the topmost layer of skin), leading to scabbing, especially on tattoos with large surface area. \n\nAlso, hennas don't get that wholly black - they take a reddish-brown appearance. If you leave the henna on for a looong time a dark reddish-brown is the best you'll do; it takes real ink for that pure a black.","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh4w","subreddit":"4chan"}

{"body":"True that.\n\nHowever, my *thought experiment*, if I can call it that was that having their government make a decision to censor their internet \u2014 the source of all of these blasphemous images \u2014 might raise awareness of the problems associated with such a closed mindset. Do they (or maybe even a significant cross section) *want* to admit these views into their society? Do they want freedom of speech in their society? Might such a scenario encourage people to try to understand the implications of their beliefs and actions?\n\nTo get back to the OP, maybe this or something like it would sway enough of their middle ground and give a bit more weight to the notion that there are other beliefs out there that can and have survived a bit of mockery and that if they want to be involved in what the rest of the world are up to, they will give this matter a bit of consideration.\n\nThere is a chance that history will reveal this comment as an utter load but I think an attitude of *They don't respect us, *therefore* we shouldn't respect them* isn't one I can subscribe to; that morally cheapens us to the point where they (and other observers, for that matter) have no option but to believe that they're dealing with an amoral society.\n\nAt the very least, I'm happy to just let them get on with it. It's a bunch of (on the grand scale) quite petty namecalling. The fact that a cartoon was banned from \u2014 or apologised for by \u2014 a newspaper simply leads me to the conclusion that I shouldn't trust newspapers.

A \"Dr. Drugs\" moved into the office next to my doctor, then one month later he was busted by the DEA and was out of there.  \n\nThen came this endless stream of Vicodin junkies who, as soon as they realized Dr. Drugs was out of business, immediately went into withdrawl, and came over to pester my doctor.  Putting a sign on the door did nothing.  Pretty soon he and his office staff were cursing at them and telling them to get lost.\n\nDidn't matter.  They were like the guy in the video.  Oblivious to anything but getting more drugs as soon as possible.\n\nThe most hideous part of it is that Vicodin is pretty much like heroin, and heroin costs half of what Vicodin costs.

{"body":"Right, I couldn't think of a way to express that without using \"open tags\".  Let's use a normal webform as an example.  Within each entry field, there could be operations happening due to user input, such as tags.  The most secure thing is to not allow anything but pure text.  That can't happen in a post submission (because people want to use italics, etc.), so at the least you would want to make sure that if I screw something up in one of my fields, it doesn't affect the rest of the page.  So if I forget to close an open italic tag, it doesn't make the rest of the page be italicized.  Expression Engine at one point screwed this up, and that's exactly what happened.  It's now fixed, in that open tags are dealt with before they affect everything else.\n\nI would have assumed the Reddit did something similar.  If they did, the process would look something like: get user input fields individually, get server fields, mix the two/render to create post.  *If* they did that, then that should also solve this issue, even though this doesn't relate to tags.  Again, I'm sure I'm missing something about the implementation.","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh4w","subreddit":"4chan"}

These threads typically move very quickly, and so unless you\u2019re relatively fast, you won\u2019t see the same thread that someone has linked to you.\r\n\r\nThat being said, treating members of 4chan as normal humans is a terrible mistake.  Child porn, aborted fetuses, butchered genitalia, rape, dead babies, porn, and a plethora of other inappropriate content can be found regularly on 4chan.  They don\u2019t care if they hurt others.  It\u2019s fun for them.\r\n\r\nMembers of 4chan typically operate as a single, destructive \u201csuper-entity\u201d whose only goal is to do stuff for the \u201clulz.\u201d  \u201cLulz\u201d are things considered to be funny at another person\u2019s expense.\r\n\r\nI feel very strongly that you should only use the results of the poll from a date before members of 4chan polluted the polls.  Telling 4chan members that what they\u2019re doing is \u201cwrong,\u201d or encouraging them to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d will not work.  You cannot convince these people to act with any sense of morals, logic, reason, or conscientiousness.  If anything, it will only give them more reason to mess up the life of someone else (namely you).\r\n\r\nBy allowing the polls to be shifted from members of 4chan, you are effectively having the votes of everyone that cares go unheard.  I urge you to not make that mistake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWtf who snitched","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh4w","subreddit":"4chan"}

It's definitely not an even split, though.  \n  \nSimilarly, I differ in my feelings towards the respective sexes, but instead of being a matter of equivalency, it's a matter of character.  I'm just more inclined to get crushes on guys, and find myself romantically interested in them.  But I notice the physical attractiveness of women more.  Then again, my tastes have also changed over time (very into older men when I was 18-25, but as I aged, guys younger than me, much to my surprise, began to be not just a tolerable alternative, but a rewarding experience).  \n  \n&gt; (not at the same time, unfortunately :P)  \n  \nBest luck remedying that, as I certainly found it worthwhile.  I had a recurring threesome situation with a hetero couple for a while.  Very circumstantial though, threesomes, I find.  In this case, I'd slept with the girl before, and was friends with the guy, so she was comfortable with me, and he was able to accept my affections happily enough, if not motivated by personal interest, as he was entirely hetero.

The man has \"carte blanche\" due to the Myth of American Omniforce (we are not all powerful). He denounces a very serious charge of rape as a \"CIA plot\", rather than let an investigation take its course. Odds are, nothing would have come of it, if he kept his drama queen yap shut about it, since it was \"consensual til the rubber broke\".\n4) I feel the same way about /b/. but the alleged DDOS against paypal (just accessed my biz account) harms more than amazon and big online retailers. It can damage donorschoose, save the children, threadless tees and a host of small businesses that only have a web presence. Assange should have asked that there be no retaliation. Instead, he gets to be a bigger martyr to his ego. He seems to forget that there are others who are wikileaks. He forgets about the havoc in their lives. Are the cables embarrassing? A bit.

{"body":"I think the difference between good taste in journalism and good taste in satire is that journalism has the expectation that noone will disagree with facts. Satire deliberately manipulates or exaggerates facts to provoke humor.\n\nFor the sake of argument, though, South Park has portrayed many, *many* figures as engaging in sex that would wildly defy their typical preferences. Far from being pointless, it did serve a (crude) purpose: it was designed to make people laugh. One may commonly associate the lifestyle of an atheist with someone with broader sexual criteria, living outside of the more \"moral\" church. It warped Dawkins into a caricature of himself, deliberately.\n\n(Also, I'm familiar with the episode you're quoting, and it *is* really good.)\n\nNow, onto your main point:\n\n&gt; it's pretty short-sighted to be judging someone who lived 1450 years ago with today's morals\n\nToday's \"morals\" are influenced by some pretty ingrained biological imperatives. A 9-year-old girl is not sexually mature. According to articles I've read on the topic of child molestation (oh that text will be used against me some day) a girl that young couldn't generally accommodate the penis of an average adult man. The term \"rape\" in this context takes on a whole new meaning here in my opinion where the victim is not simply emotionally violated, but physically damaged by the very act of intercourse.\n\nI don't believe that we've arbitrarily established our \"morals\" in the last 1450 years to exclude sex with a prepubescent girl. I believe there are biological forces at work which define what is healthy behavior and what *isn't*. (This, of course, is the conservative argument against gay marriage, but I don't believe the argument applies unless the folks involved aren't able to make a competent decision themselves, which brings me to...)\n\nFurther, sexual maturity aside, the intellectual maturity of a girl that young isn't exactly sufficient to agree to be married, is it? This girl was given away by her parents to be *consensually raped*. Whether or not the consent was given by the parents or by the 9-year-old, we have a man who acquired a living person for the purposes of \"marrying\" her well before she was capable of deciding whether that was a commitment she was interested in making. (Mind, also, that she was acquired when she was 7; he just didn't rape her until she was 9.)\n\nTo restate: The \"prophet\" Mohammed married a girl who was neither sexually nor intellectually mature enough to be in a sexual situation with an adult man. This is far and away a disgusting, insane, depraved moment in history. This young woman was raped by a \"prophet\" because of the religion *he invented*.\n\nNow, tell me again why the context of that situation is relevant at all?","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh4w","subreddit":"4chan"}

Whether that is how it's going to be, that is how it is now. That is why it is socially unacceptable for you to say nigger. If you want to say nigger, (or you want the word to be equally taboo amongst all ethnicities) then work on fixing the problem.\n\n&gt;but I think that the poor black communities are doing a great job of keeping themselves in squalor without the help of racists.\n\nRacism amongst people today is really not what's relevant, or what I'm talking about.

It's vandalism for its own sake, there's no message, no purpose. Nor is there anything about it that's particularly anti-censorship, since no form of censorship could have prevented this sort of attack. It's like saying that tagging gravestones is the \"inconvenient\" other side of freedom of speech. The whole point of 4chan seems to be to prove that nothing is sacred, nothing is off limits. Your average voter, myself included, wouldn't agree with this attitude (though in my case, it would be less out of knee-jerky moral outrage, but rather because I find the attitude nihilistic and crass). Having an anti-censorship campaign that actually has value associated with this kind of thing undermines it completely. ","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh4w","subreddit":"4chan"}
