Also, it could have been just to accelerate and gain some speed before making the ascent and turn which might require a faster speed to maintain lift.

{"body":"It's foolish to not appreciate the photography, and celebrate the lives of the victims, and hope for the worse of all the perpetrators, collaborators, and their supporters.\nBurying pictures like this, or videos, is dangerous.  Forgetting the event is ignorant.  Our children and ourselves, as we advance in age, need to embrace all of life's unexpected hiccups, and be able to reflect on the past hiccups, so they can make better decisions, and have a benchmark for what a good decision is, and remember who gave us the opportunity to make any decisions at all.\nThe Essay suggests that there was a mass suicide.  That's unfair.  These people took their last few moments to make their own last decisions, and took their end as far out of their assailants hands as they could.  It was living as much as they could, not choking on smoke and flames, with the time they had left.  I like to think the jumping was a part of these peoples lives, not their death. (Its hard when a lot of the people clearly had not \"come to terms\", not that there's any way to do that)\nI admit I know nothing.  But I told you what I told myself.

Designed to fall outwards in an earthquake.  The whole thing is seated upon some kind of teakwood floating dampers I don't understand.  Those sort of barberpole zigzag lines going up?  Optical illusion,they are flat.  The Arabic script around the doors?  Designed so it looks all one size around the door taking perspective into effect.  The marble is translucent, and glows in the sunlight, and is supposed to be amazing in the moonlight.  those designs are translucent Indian marble, one of the hardest stones there is, carved by hand, and has semi precious stones set in it in a glue that has been a trade secret since it has been built.  The guys who built it, imported from persia, were paid/encouraged/offered a deal they couldn't refuse  to never go home again to keep it from being recreated.  Their descendants still repair it, and sell marble art to tourists.\nSeriously,  this building is a piece of art that most modern humans cannot conceive of, all built out of the love ofa king to be a resign place for his wife.  And, due to a coup by one of his kids, he never was able to see it finished, except as a distant view on the horizon from a room he was imprisoned in.","subreddit_id":"t5_2r8ke","subreddit":"1000words"}

However, if it was a wider shot, for example an establishing shot the dining room the wine glass is in, then you'd probably shoot having more depth of field so your brain can create a setting for what you're viewing.\n\nFor me, having a shallow depth of field generally feels cleaner to me.

{"body":"\u201cMediocrity  Equals Hypocrisy\u201d is a work on canvas measuring 48 by 36 inches with acrylic paint, oil paint and ink. This painting is divided into three hierarchical parts. On the bottom are the masses of people assembled and bowing down to the television demigods that are on the second level of the painting.  A river of blood and gold is divided between the masses of people who are rendered colorfully to show a diversity of human types. However the predominate color in this work is red because the bottom  was red before I painted all the people Moving up the second level there are four television demigods who look the same as each other and each of them are dramatically taller then the humans  who they dwarf in size. The demigods have angel wings too and they are dressed in business suits and carry money bags and weapons, like swords. There is a fifth demigod who is the boss and who is taller and has a white, red, and black robe. He has a crown of gold and gems and a sword with genocide written on it.  This sword shoots energy into the crowds of people creating black matter explosions of destruction. Besides the demigods on the second level there is a temple behind them with a giant third eye and smaller temples off to the left and right representing bastardized establishments of power such as the media. There is a giant clock that has exploded and represents the end of time. The sun in his full glory with his evil smile and white glittering blood stained teeth he fires energy from his eyes into the crowds creating more dramatic explosions that ripple through  the masses. \nPowering the demigods is a puppeteer like giant satanic creature. This creature is on the 3rd level and he powers  and controls his demigods with marionette cables composed of flesh and human souls that are swirling upward and held by the master. The master\u2019s bones and flesh are showing and his skin is off because he is a God and has no need for such superficial things . The master is in the third stage  and this is the stage that humans and mortals cannot view. They cannot see the master who controls the demigods and absorbs their souls to give it everlasting immortal power. The master is mostly red with pipes and wires on top, oil  pumping through his veins, blood and human souls and energy shooting out of his powerful eyes. He controls the demigods who in turn control the humans in this hierarchy. To the right of the master is the factory of ideology where bloods are burning. This factory would be the place human ideas are manufactured and placed into their primitive brains. \n","subreddit_id":"t5_2r8ke","subreddit":"1000words"}

{"body":"**Day 1** Utter failure.  Went out Friday night with my cuz and hit up happy hour bar to watch the Sox-Yanks game.  Didn't open any sets there despite there being a couple of opportunities.  Later in the night, after some terrible practice at the driving range, we hit In-N-Out burger.  We order and I see this really cute girl sitting with her friend outside.  So I come right out the door, smiling, confident, and sit right at their table.  \"Hi.\" *SMILE  I start talking.  \"We're married,\" my target says.  The husband of her sister comes over.  I disarm him.  I am friendly, up-beat and an awesome guy.  My cousin comes over and is in his best \"normal-guy\" state (he's married).  He completely disarms the set further.  Now I am in deep rapport with the non-married girl.  She is Colombian and really cute.  We are talking about Salsa dancing.  I think I forget to disqualify myself.  They are leaving.  She lingers, waiting for the number close, I don't go for it.  Bah.\n\nMy cousin goes home about 10 and I hit my local club where I know the bouncers and a couple bartenders.  Place is hopping.  I enter the back and again, see a table full of girls.  Walk right up, introduce myself, hook.  They bounce somewhere, and I'm at the bar.  I hear a thick Long Island accent and go into Linda Ronstead from that SNL skit \"Coffee Talk.\"  The girls love it.  I've hooked them.  They drag me out back.  This set is funny because as I am talking to the two girls I hooked, the other two girls they with are shooting down guys who are approaching us left and right.  They form a circle around me and are basically protecting me.  It's fucking hilarious.  The mother bear comes over and looks me over, qualifies me and approves.  One funny thing that happened here is two girls were asking if I was \"part black.\"  Or if I had a \"black dick.\"  LOL!  How do you answer?  Agree and amplify?  Oh yeah, you can't tell because it's wrapped around my leg right now :)\n\nAnyway, that four set goes to the dance floor and says \"no guys!\"  Then one turns to me and says, \"but you can come with us.\"  *SMILE.  I really need to get better at reading very clear IOIs.  Anyway, I follow them for a little bit until I realize I don't want to dance and go to the bar.  Boom.  See the girl I've been lusting after since before coming to this community.  She opens me, \"when are we going running?\"  Me: \"Tomorrow.\"  Her: \"Really?\"  *Smile.  She's getting drinks and walking away.  This is it.  CLOSE!  I don't.  I am a choad.  Where have my balls gone?\n\nGo back outside.  Find my first set from earlier.  They were in a birthday party and the birthday girl shows up.  She's really cute and drunk.  We chat.  Her friend comes over.  Easily a nine.  Latina with tig ole bitties and just a cute as hell personality.  At this point I was probably too tipsy, but really should have closed either the birthday girl or latina.  Lights come on, club closes.  We go outside and I awkwardly # close one of the girls from my first set.  I really need to get better at this.  I end up giving her my number, walking away as confident as I can muster, then drunk dial my friend, lol.\n\nLessons learned: When in the field, it is not time to be getting sloppy.

{"body":"2-4 (9/2) - This one was surprisingly random. I have never really gone to a bar before, and I would rate (on a scale of 1-10) my night game to be absolute zero. I didn't know what the fuck I was doing there, and I did the AFC round, pretending to be a tourist (which I basically am) and checking out the local student bar (great happy hour deals). Everyone seemed to be closed out in a group already, so I found this guy who was sitting by himself. The happy hour deal favored pairs, so I figured \"What the hell, I need to talk to SOMEONE\".\n\nSo I walk up and ask if he was waiting for someone (kind of) and just started talking to the guy (figured I might as well meet a few locals and make some friends. We get talking, learn a little about him, and suddenly 3 more peeps walk up (2 guys and a HB7). Turns out they all just made it into a program together, and I get talking to the HB7 for a bit, learn about what student life is like in the area and joke about her studies a little. Suddenly, more and more people start to come in. The group eventually ended up being about 20+ in size.\n\nWith the next group I meet two more HB6's, and get cut off from the HB7 (but I don't really mind, since I'm here just to meet people anyway). Get talking, use basic rapport questions, etc. Eventually I can't think of anything to say, so I go with a standard question: What superpower would you have (I find it a fun way to learn more about people and a great jumping point for anything else). The conversation with one of them kicks into high gear, and I eventually snag a #-close.\n\nI switch around to meet a few more people, talk to a few new guys, and get bored (two guys I talked to were really hard to keep a convo going with, could never break out of the rapport Q stage) and ended up back in a circle with the HB6 and a new HB6. Get talking, fun convo, etc.\n\nLater after I left, I saw the new HB6 again, we ended up catching the same bus, and had a nice little convo on the way back.\n\nSo #2 was the HB7, #3 was the #-close, and #4 was the new HB6. Hopefully I'll see them around 'cuz they were great fun to hang with.\n\nLessons learned: Just fucking do it, holy shit. If I can get past the rapport phase and into a real convo, I can really keep it flowing. I just need to get to that point, and that will only get better with practice. In this case, using the superpower question was a GREAT way to move into interests and talking about whatever. Maybe I should think of more of these random Q's to ask in the future. I'll try them out and see if the results keep coming.\n\nNotes: There was basically no kino. I thought about it, but I couldn't think of a way to make it work. While it's not my goal, this is something I really have to get working on eventually. It's such a great way to build comfort. Hopefully this encounter helps me build some self-confidence so I can try this again in the near future. My goal this night was mostly just to meet new people, and I definitely did just that. I think I got lucky meeting a group of new people, and it was really easy for me to isolate the loner already (esp. considering you almost NEED pairs to work the HH deal) and move into the group. This is easy for me to pull off, but I need to be more confident to join a pre-existing group it seems. I almost turned into a huge AAFC (average awkward frustrated chump) and had to walk out.

{"body":"\nOK, busy day. Just got back from Bay Area Seddit meetup/night on the town.\n\nSchool was fine, even though I'd been up til 2AM finishing homework and was getting drowsy. It got off to a good start, had a chat with a girl in the elevator. Easy enough, 20 down, 80 to go.\n\nIn class we were hanging up our homework so I saw a chance to talk to a cute girl who sits pretty near me but always seems kind of unapproachable. My suspicions were unfounded, had a pretty good interaction and now we're pretty friendly. Cool!\n\nWent to meet up with they Bay Area Seddit crew, a real first class group of guys. I must have met like 8-10 new people, but I'm not sure about counting any of them because I wasn't very proactive with  my interactions. I've come a ways but it can still be hard to avoid lapsing into being a passive wallflower.\n\nWent to a club, Vertigo I think, to get stamped but I saw a really cute girl and said it's go time so I came in with my ol \"what are you celebrating line?\" Some minor confusion ensued, first interaction so I don't think I had my bar voice on but whatever, got my first interaction out of the way and I think I might have been the first in the crew to open that night. Interaction went decent, but it looked like she might be with a boyfriend so I didn't push it. Heckz tells me I could have, but we live and learn, 21 down, 79 to go.\n\nRoll into McTeagues, meet up with Kumar, good times. Just milling around, chilling. Not many good sets now, I can sort of feel the tension. I spot two girls behind our crew and I gird my loins, time to get going. I roll up and unload the patented \"What are you celebrating?\" We decide we're all celebrating Friday. One girl seems sort of open, the other is on her cell so I ask her how her stocks are doing. The end up telling me I look like a friend of theirs and that it's a good thing. I smile, say thanks and run out of shit to say so I eject. A good try, haha, 2 set so 23 down, 77 to go.\n\nHanging out with some of the crew and I see a two set at the bar. There's one asian girl I think is really hot, so I gotta try. I walk up and make eye contact, but she just give me this look that makes me think she doesn't want shit to do with me and I about face. I go back to my dudes and they give me shit so I turn around and walk back over and open the OK looking friend who didn't see me. It went pretty well, although the asian friend still seems a little this side of pissed off. Oh well, had a short but decent convo, but most importantly saved face haha. Gonna say 24 down, 76 to go since I honestly can't remember saying much to the asian before she pulled her friend away to meet her boyfriend/homosexual friend, couldn't be sure.\n\nWas hanging out with another sedditor who was British and the guys were joking about going up to a girl and being like \"who has the better British accent\" and the non-British dude just going super over the top with a fake accent. I'm trying to be the dude volunteering so I say lets do it and he goes to open these two chicks, saying I should join in in a minute. Problem is it seems like it's going well for him on my end and I don't want to fuck it up. But on the other hand I don't want to look like I spussied out, so eventually my fear of being a pussy boy wins out and I go up and totally spit my line. I can instantly tell it isn't the best move, but it's not the worst and I end up having a pretty decent interaction. Still feel a little bad but dude was real chill and gave me good advice about my posture. My nervousness is showing and I'm tensing up in sets, I end up working on it the rest of the night. Anyways, 25 down, 75 to go.\n\nHanging back with the guys, one decides to check out the back of the bar and invites me so we head back. Dude spots a two set in a booth like a pro and just sits down next to one girl and I sit down with the other. Both girls seem receptive but I was focused on mine and she was really friendly. Yes! We ended up havingg a really good 20 minute conversation, she was a super cool chick. I probably should have at least asked for the number, but I had a good time. Made the night worth it, for sure. 26 down, 74 to go.\n\nAfter the long conversation I had it was a little hard to get back into the swing of approaching. Ended up seeing a really super hot, in my eyes, girl walking around looking a little alone and lost. That's an invitation for me. I was super nervous, but I just rolled up and said \"Hi, I'm Jon.\" She was friendly, but it was a sort of courtesy friendly, her arms were crossed and she kept looking around the bar, but it was pleasent enough.  Part of me thinks I cared too much looking back and as such was a little too just \"friendly\" which isn't really interesting. The one time I really grabbed her attention was when I asked her what her favorite thing about San Francisco was and told her mine was all the homeless people. Good stuff, but I still have to say I'm having trouble dealing with outcome independence her, I'm getting to the point where just opening isn't as big a deal here and it's sort of playing with my mindset. Plus there's also the irony that I'm better talking to girls I'm unattracted to then the ones I am, this being an example. Things to think about, but the important thing is the approach! 27 down, 73 to go.\n\nAt this point it's like 12:15 and it may sound lame but I'm getting a little worn out. I'm not used to bars or approaching hot girls, put the two together and it's mentally tiring. I go outside to clear my head, but I'm losing interest. Still, I see a hot looking 3 set outside of Mayes and say guck it and roll up and ask them if it's any good since I've never been there. They say it's cool, we exhcange pleasentries and I tell them to have a good night. I did it, that one more approach past my comfort zone. 28 down, 72 to go.\n\nAt that point I was done, I had gone out without someone to constantly push me and approached girls, I did what for so many years had seemed impossible. Good times, excited to go out again.","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

{"body":"**Day 5**  I skipped a couple of days where nothing happened.  For instance, over the weekend I went to McTigues with other s'bayers and opened tons of sets.  None of them ended with a makeout and none of them got to the point where I would've felt comfortable number closing.  There were two sets where I had really good rapport and felt there was a mutual amount of attraction, but I am still not escalating aggressively enough, soon enough.  Definitely something I need to work on.\n\nHowever, there was SUCCESS.  Last night hittup DTSJ with some of the crew.  Opened a few sets.  Most of the night was spent looking for somewhere to go.  We found one place called SJ Bar and Grill.  They had beer pong going in there, so we checked it out.  ViperV and I played a game.  One girl I made eyes with while playing and then made a move, which she responded to.  I have been focusing more on my nonverbal cues lately.  She seemed receptive if I would have gone over and opened her, but I didn't.  Grrr.  One set I did open was a three set at the bar.  I was talking to this one girl and another girl came up behind me and started moving or something.  She was doing SOMETHING behind my back.  So I turned around and was like, \"What the hell are you doing back there?\" in my best cocky-funny voice.  She was like, \"Oh, sorry, I just ran into you.\"  Lol, shit test passed, obstacle disarmed.  I continued talking to her friend and tried to get her to root for me in beer pong.  I told her to cheerlead for me.  She said she wasn't a cheerleader but neither was I.  I told her she could root for me and it would be our secret.  \"Just send positive thoughts my way.\"  Lol, I'm such a choad.  Went back to playing.\n\nEventually we leave SJBG to hit up Dive Bar.  There aren't many sets there.  There's one set in the back so I go and open them, but they aren't hooking, so I just split.  As we're getting ready to go, this two set comes in.  I instantly start talking to the one next to me.  She's smiling and receptive.  We're talking about SOMETHING, who the fuck knows.  I say, \"Look, I've got to get going, but this is really fun.  We should hang out again.\"  She says, \"yeah.\" *smile.*  I say, \"How're we going to make sure it happens?\"  She says, \"I can give you my phone number.\"  **CLOSE 1**  God that took FOREVER.\n\nI wasn't that interested in her, but I just needed to get it out of the way.  Texted her when I got home last night, \"Hey!  Don't forget we have a date planned soon at the Dive Bar. ;)\"  Probably not the best thing, but w/e.  Three hours later (after 4am) I get the response, \"Is this the whiteboy in the hat?\"  LOL.  NOPE.  Probably won't text her again.","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}
{"body":"[Approaches #9-21]\n\nMen and women of gentle disposition, I attended a live music event last night, also known as a concert, and had to wait in line for about 30minutes. I have pretty good line game. I don't like waiting in silence, so I'm forced to talk to people around me. The band that was playing attracts a lot of young attractive cool girls so it's always fun. \n\nI'll write about it tomorrow as I'm quite tired from dancing but there were 13 people, 4 that i had met from cold approaches awhile back. good night for me!\n\nThere were two women behind me in line that opened my friend (girl) and I about a mutual friend. I opened her friend and we talked throughout the line. Two other women went behind them and I informed them about the progress of the line and got to talking about whether or not they give money to the homeless as a homeless man just passed us. Turns out they're all social workers; my sister is a social worker and I work within the field and know someone who just got into the program they're in. Boom, all four new people together. Fun stuff. Then one of their friends did a \"chat n' cut\" into our line and began to speak with us. Not a bad guy, not a bad guy. \n\nAt one point I opened the girl in front of me because she was by herself. She said she had some people on the way, chatted a bit. Turns out the people she had on the way were girls I opened way back on St. Patrick's Day, the hottest girl gave me her # but nothing came of it. That was about January I got her # at another bar. Anyway it's a lot of fun to talk to these girls. I shook hands with one of them and neither of us let go for awhile. I broke first, after like 15 seconds I should've definitely kept it. Oh well. I was making these girls laugh a lot and they were hitting me - at one point we were talking about some author and one said, \"Oh, I have a soft spot for him.\" I replied, 'I have a hard spot for him' and received indulgent giggles and arm hits. Not really clever, but quick enough. Unfortunately these girls left the line but I texted the girl later and said we'd be friends. \n\nAnother British girl behind me in line, she was out for her though, left for a long time and then saw me in line 20minutes later and asked if she could cut in where she was before. I said it wasn't my vote. She then started to tell me stories and justify herself for cutting in, I stopped her saying I didn't care and she replied, \"I was only trying to tell you a story, love.\" I didn't really like this behaviour so I ignored her I think. \n\nAnd then three drunk girls went right behind me. Annoyingly drunk. I opened them but they were too drunk and thought they were the shit when in fact they were tepid hoovers of popular culture. One of the girls squeezed her body against the rope and started to snake ahead of people. I called her out on it and of course she denied it and her friend started to give me the lip because I was being rude. \"I thought you were being friendly,\" she said: 'I thought you were behind me in line' I replied. I don't like it when people are clearly cheating you and then try to make you feel bad for calling them out on it through emotional manipulation. I let her know this. Called her out but they still snuck ahead. I was ticked but whatever we were going to get in anyway. The drunkest one was humiliated by the bouncer, asked her what the 14th letter of the alphabet was, asked how many beers she drank (\"only three!!!\" 'since you've been in line, or the whole night') - definitely a spectacle. People cheered him on. I finally got in, went to pay cover, cut in front of these same girls, the sweetest revenge.\n\nInside I was opened by another girl I was gaming awhile back. She seemed really down for me but OH how things changed. I'm not really for her anymore, she's put on weight and tends to drink too much for my liking. Still felt a bit flattered she kept hugging and touching me, spent a lot of time around my friend (who is a girl, again) and I dancing, found me again to tell me she had to go..lots of interest from her. She wants to go out etc.\n\nI opened the bartender because I see her in my neighbourhood all the time but she's always distracted with iPods etc. She said next time to high five her and stop and chat. I will most definitely. She's got a look for sure. Older...but sexier for it.\n\nLast open was the shexay cousin of one of my good friends. I've only met her once but she's realllly spicy. Talked to her whilst dancing and sent some smiles back and forth. Wanted to chat a bit once the music stopped but I left at the encore as I was beat tired from the day's accumulated exercise. \n\nOverall a pretty good night even though I went in really tired. Forced myself to go out and got a lot of experience for the challenge! Felt really great, I love talking to people it's just the open I need a pretense still...\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

{"body":"Ended up at a very small private party whose association to me is so loose, two years ago I wouldn't have even dreamt of being there. As soon as I found out it was this girl's birthday, I went up to her even though I've never met her and she was in a conversation with her friend, and said, \"Happy birthday!\" She positively beamed at me and I made some stupid comment about how I'm not going to try and guess her age (which I was already told, and which is high enough for it to be rude to mention). Then I walked away. I tried seducing her, and though she was receptive to kino and was acting like she was looking to get laid, I must've messed up somehow and she would drift away from me. Eventually she disappeared with another guy and returned much later but couldn't stop making out with him. So at least my read of her was right.\n\nAnyway, I talked to other girls there too, and even got the number of one (who I think is married) so I can invite her to a party I plan to throw. We texted playfully back and forth twice but I stopped responding because I wasn't sure what to say, since I'm fairly certain she actually is in a relationship and since I'm not really interested in her even if she isn't.\n\nOverall, I'll count this as 2 approaches. I couldn't *not* approach these girls at some point, since there were so few people, but on the other hand, I talked to all five girls there and technically approached each.\n\n1/10th of the way there!","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

I'm just having second thoughts about this whole business of approaching random girls, but whatever, a challenge is a challenge so I should just man up. I've done *some* approaches.\n\n#18. I was in Vegas for one night. Went to the pool area during the day and spent some time with people I know. I kept looking around at all these \"cool-looking\" people around me, including lots of girls and thinking, \"What the hell? Why am I not talking to them?\" Eventually walked up to some girl who was smoking and asked her for a cigarette. She seemed sort of confused but her friend frigging *swooped in* from like 10ft away to talk to me with lots and lots of interest. Did some chatting, really basic kino and then she said she had to go to the bathroom (I think she was actually being beckoned for a girl-talk by her seemingly gay male friend). I just said alright and went back to my group. Later, as I was leaving, I happened to run into her and told her she should give me her number so we can meet up later. She told me she didn't have a phone (she was from Canada) but her girlfriend who was in the bathroom did and I should go ask her. I explained to her that I am not going to stand outside the bathroom to ask a girl I never met for her phone number so I can meet up with her friend so she accompanied me to the bathroom, got her friend and gave me the number. We did a tiny bit of bantering and I said I had to go so we parted ways. She called me a cutie. I texted them later, but I ended up really fucking it up because I was too focused on playing poker and we never did meet up.\n\n#19. Also in Vegas, much later, with my buddy, looking for the club where these girls supposedly were. I tapped on the shoulder a really hot girl that was lagging behind her group and asked her where the club was. She explained it was just up the escalator and I tried to make a conversation out of it but failed, so I thanked her and left. We went to the club, it was $30 cover and I balked and decided to go play poker instead. Stayed up all night, lost $500 and felt like shit afterwards. Stupid.\n\n#20. At the climbing gym, commented to this girl about a crazy-looking jump she did, but didn't really bother taking the conversation out of bouldering.\n\n#21. My very first day approach! I was walking to my bus stop and there was a girl walking ahead of me. Some homeless-looking dude started hollering at her, telling her she's really beautiful etc. She was thanking him as she sped away. I wasn't going to do anything about it but then I surprised myself by catching up to her and  using this as the opener! \"Does this happen to you a lot?\" This is when I realized she was wearing earphones, but she diligently took them out and engaged me in a conversation. We walked for a few blocks and I think I was mostly doing alright. Sometimes I would pause thinking of what to say (or wondering if I should eject) and she would chime in, so I think she was somewhat into me. She was kind of half-checking me out. Towards the end of our walk, I meekly said, \"Do you want to get a coffee sometime?\" And she turned me down, mumbling about how she has a boyfriend. I said whatever, I don't care, but it's not cheating to have coffee, then said bye to her when we parted. In retrospect, I doubt she had a boyfriend, and I probably fucked up a bit earlier on (too lazy to write out an analysis, but I think I know where). Oh well, live and learn.

{"body":"[Approaches #21-30]\n\nHmm. Wasn't feeling too energetic this morning, only had 6 hours of sleep - which seems enough considering the lives of many around the globe, but isn't enough for me. I went over to my FWB girl and had middling to bad sex because I just wasn't in the mood but forced it for her sake. Sort of wish I hadn't because it put me in a strange frame. Oh well, it was first day of class and I'm always excited to see who's in with me..\n\nApproach #22: I was late so I couldn't really decide where to sit but I ended up next to a spicy enough girl. Laughed at the same things throughout class, had some little underthebreath comments; after class I simply said, \"Well, what do you think of that?\" She was pretty candid and open, we walked to the bookstore together. Sarah. Fun enough girl. Good to meet her. I left abruptly because I didn't want to wait in the line. \"Alright Sarah, see you when I see you then.\" Saw her 10 minutes later in the library ahha. \n\nApproach #23: Opened a girl working for The Globe and Mail before she could open me. I was genuinely interested in a subscription but this just seemed like a good small talk opportunity with an attractive girl too. Went well but I had to leave to eat.\n\nApproach #24-25: I went over to get my bus pass for the year and while waiting in line opened two girls behind me. Just made a few comments about a situation I was in about my student identification, wasn't really prying harder or plowing into the conversation as they had their own thing going on, but we still had a small back and forth. Good enough. \n\nApproaches #26-27: Opened two girls whilst waiting for the bus. Teased one about her flip phone, can't remember the last time I had a flip phone. The other girl was a nursing student and we shared a few things back and forth but they seemed somewhat nervous and didn't open up much. I felt good though. \n\nApproaches #28-30: Opened three people on the bus because I sat in their...quad set of seats. On this particular bus they have two seats facing forward, two sets in front of those seats facing the people sitting in them. Sort of like on a train, so you're staring at two strangers in front of you, or, more likely, two strangers in front of you are attempting not to make eye contact with you or brush their knees against you. I have issues with this seating arrangement, and I brought them up, to the hilarity of the group (2 guys, 1 girl, all strangers). Felt like Larry David. Hooked very well and the two guys were very friendly; the girl was/is an international student from Saudi Arabia, she was the last to leave but we still talked about culture shock together, etc. She asked me a few questions too. Neat. \n\nWith this I'm learning for my next challenge I'd like to do 100sets of DIRECT approach, with statement or implicit statement of sexual intent. I'm slowly learning how easily it is to talk to anyone, but that's just talking. Still, it's the first step. I'm so much further along than I was this time...well, especially since a year ago but even months. There's a girl in my class that I had a crush on last year in another class but never approached. Today I made devilish eye contact the whole class and I know I'll easily approach her Monday should logistics work or if I can catch her after class. Why wouldn't I?

{"body":"Crazy Weekend\n\n*Friday Night*\n\n**1** A buddy of mine invites two girls over to pregame a frat party. HB8 and HB7. I play pong against them and (of course) win. \n\nAfter we drink for a while, I suggest that everyone in the house plays a game similar to charades. I teach everyone the game, and completely get the feeling of \"taking over the room.\" I am DHV by teaching everyone something new and exciting. \n\nHB7 sits next to me and there's some light keno. When she gets ready to leave for a frat party, she asks if I'm coming. I can't because I am on a sports team that practices at 6:00am Monday through Saturday. Overall I think I built some attraction. I felt very Alpha. \n\n*Saturday* \n\n**2** I'm at a bar with a group of friends. I see a HB7 standing alone. It's late in the night. I walk up to her and say \"you're cute, but are you friendly?\" My first direct approach ever! Hooray! She smiles. We talk for a bit - typical conversation about majors and whatnot.\n\n I'm feeling good when some AMOG comes running in, puts his arm around her, and stands right between us. I am taken aback and just leave. My first time getting noticeably AMOGed. I guess this is a learning process. \n\n**3** I try the same line on a HB8 standing with two friends. She gives me this horrified look. I'm fairly drunk and this point, and just walk away. I'm surprised how little the rejection hurts.  \n\n**4** Walking back to my house I see a HB8 sitting down looking sick. I go over to ask if she's alright. She is with HB7 and HB7's boyfriend. We chat for a bit, and end up going to get some food. I talk to HB8 for a while, and eventually find out that she doesn't go to school, is only 18, and has a son. She's cute and I'm drunk, so I keep spitting game. She seems somewhat responsive. I end up smoking weed at HB7's house with HB8 and HB7's boyfriend. A bunch of new people show up, including HB8's baby daddy, so I decide it's time to leave. \n\n*Sunday*\n\nI have smoked less than 10 times in my life, but end up smoking for the second day in a row. My friend asks if I want to go to a house party. I'm pretty stoned, but think about how I'm determined to be more social and end up going. I get anxious when I smoke, and the social situation is completely overwhelming. There is a HB9 sitting and chatting with a HB7 but I'm too nervous to approach. \n\n**5** I see a HB6 that I had talked to a few days earlier at a club on campus. She remembers me vaguely. We chat for maybe five minutes, and it goes alright. Her friends come over to introduce themselves. Eventually, she says \"well, I need to go say \"hi\" to people\" and leaves. I get the feeling there's no attraction. \n\n**6** I am pouring myself a beer and say \"hi\" to a HB4 who is hosting the party. She is very friendly. I'm not into her, but talking to her is a good excuse to not socialize with others. I still feel incredible anxious. We talk for about an hour. Despite limited psychical attraction, I practice seduction, specifically strong eye contact. She gives me every IOI in the book. Eventually, I leave with my friends. Later that night, HB4s friend texts my friend to ask for my number. Apparently HB4 really wanted to see me again. I'm flattered, but decide not to give up my number. \n\n*Takeaways*\n\nI felt someone content with my effort. I didn't talk to a single girl for the entire summer, so just getting out and chatting it up with new people was a moral victory. Actually doing a direct approach was exciting.\n\n Overall, I think the big lesson of the weekend is that staying sober is critical for picking up girls. I'm looking forward to finishing 100 sets, and making this the best year of my life. ","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

{"body":"Last night I lost count of how many sets I opened, but I didn't plow through all of them. I'll just post five sets I did plow through.\n\n\nRecently, I've been ascribing themes to various nights so I can work on different aspects of my game. The theme for last night was vomiting, since I often have trouble continuing conversations past the opening. Talking incessantly makes it very hard to build attraction, but last night was more about building the confidence that I can carry a conversation. I also talked to hotter girls than I usually talk to, so that was nice.\n\n\n**Set 11**\n\n\nI walk up to a group of three girls, HB5,7,7.5, and say... something. I kept three things in the back of my mind to say in case the conversation stalled, and one of these was 'Do you guys observe labor day?' This question worked pretty well at the start of the night, but became less effective after midnight, either because people were too drunk to get it or I was too tired to deliver it well. We get into a fun conversation about Christmas, and I tease HB7.5 (from Finland) by talking about how weird the Santa Claus myth is over there. She claims she works at a movie theater, but surprises me with how much she knows about research. Intrigue on both ends here. The girls leave to go to the bathroom, but I've built up a fair bit of attraction just by being interesting. I didn't go for a close, so I'm not sure if this counts as plowing or not.\n\n\n**Set 12**\n\n\nA guy spills his beer near my feet. He picks it up as I turn around and he tries to blame it on me. I make a joke about how I was using it to stuff my pants, and he moves to intentionally spill the beer on me. I calmly grab it from his hand, tell him that what he's doing isn't very nice, and ask him what he would do if someone tried to do that to him as I slowly tip the beer bottle towards him. He backs off, and his HB7.5 friend apologizes for him. I sense attraction, and go direct, and she's digging it. Her friend pulls her away to the bathroom before I can go anywhere with it (2 BAS guys were standing behind me, come on!). I try to pick up the number later but I do it awkwardly and fail. \n\n\n**Set 13**\n\n\nI open a blonde HB7 by asking her why there are so many blondes in the bar today and tease her about the blonde convention. We move to other topics, and I try to describe the zoochosis sketch (about bestiality) which I saw on reddit earlier this week to her. She gives me a lot of shit for this and is fairly weirded out, but I stick in there and we start talking about real life superheroes. She leaves, but I see her several times throughout the night, including one time when I accidentally re-open her to our collective amusement. At one point, she remarks that I have 'great conviction,' because I'm unreactive to her constant bullshit. I guess all this plowing training must be doing something. Despite this, I'm not sure if I've built attraction, since she refers to us as 'frenemies,' and rolls her eyes whenever she sees me. I thought she was fun, but I fail on the number close because BALD ASSHOLE (who I mention below) decides to come in and AMOG me (# closing hasn't been a problem for me before this weekend, so I'm not going to make much ado about nothing).\n\n\n**Set 14**\n\n\nI see a three set with a black HB7 who I think is cute. Most black girls find me physically attractive for some unknown reason. As we start talking, BALD ASSHOLE comes in and engages the other two girls. I'm not one to waste a free isolation, so I engage this girl by talking about the stories behind Indian holidays. She seems attracted but unable to articulate her passion well. I actually noticed this with several sets, and I'm wondering if it's that some girls are just inarticulate, or I haven't built enough comfort/attraction for them to open up. BALD ASSHOLE turns around and tells me to stop talking to his girlfriend (what are you doing, asshole? You had two girls, don't rain on my parade ajsjsjfdkfas). I put my arm around her and she says 'I'm your girlfriend?' BALD ASSHOLE is undeterred, and pushes my arm off of her, at which point I get angry and start talking about teletubbies until both of them walk off (in retrospect, idiotic. I think I was trying to confuse him, but I ended up losing value). \n\n\nI'm much better at defusing clever AMOGS, since their egos are susceptible to wit. I just get angry when an idiot comes up, but I realize now that the best way to deal them is to just ignore them. \n\n\n**Set 15**\n\n\nI walk up to a seated three set HB 7.5,7.5,7.75, and, immediately, two of the girls start laughing. I roll with it and pace the reality ('I know that look, that's the I've been approached by 10 guys already today look'). I sit down and call them assholes. I've noticed that, if girls act like bitches, you can call them out on it playfully by calling them assholes, while avoiding the negative connotation of calling them a bitch. I engage HB7.75, who is very boring. T0dk0n and TofuTofu come in and talk with the other two girls, with t0dk0n getting a number (nice, dude!), and TofuTofu's interaction being slightly less lackluster than my own. I think I need to calibrate a bit better to quiet girls, since they generally aren't as forthcoming with IOIs. Or, I could just man up and assume attraction. At any rate, I didn't get the sense that she was attracted to me. We leave shortly thereafter, but I'll put this in the 'plowing' category because of the initial blowout attempt.\n\n\n**Takeaways**\n\n\nIt was a rough night. No success in terms of even a single number close, but I think that my game has progressed. It's the times when things aren't going well that define our strength as human beings, so I'm going to solder on through with measured optimism.\n\n\nTalking is not a problem anymore, but I have to work on everything around it. T0dk0n gave me some great tips on body language after we left the bars, and I need to work on my vocal tonality, pacing and volume. There are a few vestiges of AA which I need to blast away, but opening 10+ sets last night definitely helped with that. Finally, I'm gonna shift out of question mode and just make statements, while using my body language to indicate that the girl should respond in turn.

After about 5 minutes of banter and passing her shit test about me being a player (I tell her I play football and basketball) I ask her if she has ever played \"Big Buck Hunter.\" She says no. I guide her by the hand to the BBH machine. We play the arcade game. It is fun. High fives every time she does something good in the game. I tell her that she is so good and we need to play again sometime. I make her text herself from my phone to exchange numbers.  We go back to her group of friends. I tell them that this bar sucks because the only game is BBH. I suggest a bar that has pool. We bounce to the new bar. I order a pitcher of beer for everyone. Her friends want to take shots. They buy me a shot. I cheers to \"the best of times.\" I play pool with HB8. We make out. I fail to isolate and they all leave in a taxi. We flirt over text message for a week, hang out one more time where I joke about putting her in the friend zone. We never talk again.","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

{"body":"So 5th to 15th set here, basically the same M.O. I decided that since I spend a lot of time in the subway I would work on doing something there. Things against me:\n\n- looks weird to just change seats because you spotted someone\n- loud noise makes it difficult to talk\n- people are often listening to music, playing with their phones or reading\n- other people can easily hear and interact.\n\n\nWith all of this in mind I started by working slowly on smooth these rough edges, first I'd spot whom I'd like to talk with before going in the train or once in the train and sit next to them or across to them (not directly but across-right) without paying much attention to their faces.\n\n\nI started noticing how people (women specially) are constantly checking out people that pass infront of them, but really heavily doing so and I don't know if it's that I've been paying more attention or that they don't do it subtly but I can see when they do it 9 out of 10 times now.\n\n\nI worked the loud noise to my advantage, first it costed me and I had to make the conscious effort not to lean forward to hear them, now I just do and they lean forward if interested if not, I just start looking somewhere else and they do it afterwards or raise the voice.\n\n\nAbout them being busy, if people look a lot into what they're doing, I just don't annoy them otherwise I jump right in. I found out you can easily tell if people are really interested in what they are doing and will be annoyed to be interrupted or are just trying not to look around for being shy or some other reason.\n\n\nAbout other people easily hearing, I just don't care anymore.\n\n\nI also have to say that every time this women are either alone or a two set, which I've found is easier for me to begin with. \n\n\nSo sets 5 to 15 were pretty much the same I have been practicing my attention to detail so I spot something interesting they're wearing, doing and engage in conversation about that. Not much happens, and the first sets were pretty much ok, and just left after a while. However the last 3 I opened I noticed something changed, I didn't know exactly what with #13 and #14 but I found out with #15.\n\n\n#13[HB7], I noticed she had a beautiful watch and started talking to her complimenting her watch, from then we moved on to smalltalk and I was able to get her to tell me where she's from, what she's doing, what she wants to do with her life. However in the end I spotted myself leaning forward and investing myself too much and so I decided to cut it out and lean back, after I did so she leaned forward a bit and continued talking. We got to her stop (remember this is all happening in the time you have between 1 station and your stop which is anywhere from 3 to usually around 5 minutes more if you're lucky), and once we were there I just said nothing (chickened out) and she just plainly stood up, turned and looked at me and said \"well, very nice meeting you have a great stay in Germany\" gave me a huge smile and walked away.\nIn retrospect I could've asked for her number but oh well, I blew it and I was (am) learning so ok.\n\n\n#14[HB6] I spotted an (honestly) interesting ring on her and started asking about it, got her to tell me how her parents gave it to her about 10 years ago, what she was doing that day and how she wants to change jobs. Again, spotted myself too invested and stopped it. She however did not lean forward or was that interested so when her stop came she just stood up and told me she had fun talking to me and left.\n\n\n#15[HB8] I was waiting for my train and when the wagons passed I spotted a girl in a complete green jumpsuit, I walked quickly to that wagon (hoping she wouldn't notice) and got in there (because you know, I just HAD to do it I mean a green jumpsuit is SUCH an easy opener). \n\n\nI sat across her so our shoulders would be infront of each other (that is, I'm not infront of her directly) and I took off my earphones looked her in the eye and just plainly said \"I'm sorry, I gotta ask what's with the clothes?\" She looked at me and just laughed and started explaining me she was part of a publicity stunt for a company and she's part of a group of people who would be doing that for that day and the weekend. \nI then asked her if what was she supposed to be, and she told me, \"oh well, nothing just a girl in a green jumpsuit\" to which I replied \"really? I would've thought you had more imagination than that\" (with a cocky smile across my face), she just laughed it off and said she was an alien, I told her that was more like it and she should tell me where she was from but she should also come sit right next to me because the noise from the subway didn't allow me to here her properly (by this time I had noticed that I hadn't at ALL leaned forward - she was the one doing so actually) So she just complied and moved right next to me, turned her body to my and leaned forward while proceeding to explain to me she was from Venus (huge smile on her face).\n\n\nAfter a bit of chitchat I said \"so, when do I get to see the alien without the jumpsuit?\" (at this time I was basically working my kino over her thigh and hand and she was perfectly receptive) she smiled but then looked down and said \"well I don't think my boyfriend would like that\". I decided it was ok, and just went with it, telling her it was ok, and she added \"but you know, I'm wearing only underwear beneath this\" and I told her I thought so (you could see the underwear beneath the suit clearly\" and I just ran my hand across her underwear line over her butt and she was perfectly fine with it (surprising to me). \n\n\nIn any case, her stop arrived and she told me she was late so she got up, and left, but I think I just might go to that publicity stunt later today haha.\n\n\n**Quick note:**\nGotta say I, of course, have also been ignored a couple of times and well, I found out I just don't care anymore, they're being the rude ones so, whatever just move on. =) ","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}
{"body":"1. Two set (HB 3,4) waiting for the train at the platform, asked the time. Could have easily moved the convo forward (they weren't sure of the time), but didn't.\u00a0\n\n2. An HB4 on the train, she looked \u00a0tired, with bloodshot eyes. Sat across her, asked for the time. Got a smile and could have moved the convo forward easily, but again didn't.\u00a0\n\nNot really sure why I didn't move the convo forward in 1&amp;2. \u00a0One thing I am sure of though: it wasn't a conscious decision. I think it may be a residual AA, getting out of an uncomfortable situation the moment I accomplished the minimum requirements for the approach to count.\u00a0\n\nGood thing is that I've noticed the opportunities to move the conversation forward.\u00a0The realisation did come a few seconds after I ejected, but at least I noticed them.

As I went to fix my coffee, I noticed she was toasting something.  \"What are you making?\" \"A bagel.\" \"It's a little late for bagels.\" \"They make a good snack.\"  She seemed a bit tense, so I stopped talking for a few seconds and said, \"See you later,\" as I left.

I don't remember what I open with.  She points to the guy behind me who has a raccoon tail sticking out of his pants.  We laugh.  We talk about shit.  She says she's from Texas.  Eventually she says she's going to the Pats game tomorrow (this was a Saturday night).  As a Pats fan, I know the Pats are playing in Oakland and that anyone would call it a Raider's game if they weren't a Pats fan.  So when she said the Pats game, I go, \"Are you a Pats fan?!\"  She is.  I kino heavily.  We go into some rapport.  She says, \"OK, well, I'm not really from Texas, I'm actually from the OC.\"  I make fun of her for lying, she says she won't lie to her again.  I say that she's my girlfriend from now on.  \n\nMy wing comes over and says it's time to go, so I tell her, \"Look, I have to go, but I've really enjoyed talking to you.

She seemed to half-acknowledge what I say and take a large step back, I introed myself and she kind of acted in a \"wheres-my-manners\"-kind-of-way. She said she was really late to work (and seemed it... was in a hurry). I said bye to her (should have pushed for close despite odds seeming poor).\n\nThings to keep in mind are that I often do these in the morning when I am not warmed up at all (in fact this was the first thing i said to anyone). i am competing with the morning commute. they are probably also not warmed up and just woke up. and in general, i am approaching the hottest girls i see... like at a minimum 9s... honestly, mostly girls i'd say could be 10s. i expect a huge rejection rate with these... but really, if it takes 100 or more approaches for just 1 it's a fair effort methinks ;)","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

No response.\n\n\n52 - 10/31 - Walked up to a chick with a light up bra and told her I liked her costume. \n\n53 - 11/01 - Went up to a girl by the bus stop at school and asked her what classes she was taking and what she was up to. We talked for a minute before she got up and left(her ride was there).\n\n54 - 11/01 - Saw a good looking girl while switching buses. Started up a conversation on school. We talked about Halloween for a bit and I got her name.\n\n55 - 11/01 - Went to the library and saw a really cute girl with dreads. I hate dreads but I complemented her on them as an opener. Asked her what she was doing. Didn't get much out of her so I ejected.\n\n56 - 11/02 - Complemented a girl at school on her Dia De Los Muertos face paint and had a cool conversation with her. Didn't get to exchange names or anything but I'm sure I will tomorrow. \n\n57 - 11/02 - Saw a cute girl at the fiction section of the library. Asked her if she knew where the magazines section was. She helped me out but left before I could make any conversation. \n\n58 - 11/03 - Saw a girl with a Domo back-pack outside the library. Went up to her to complement her on it and chatted for about a minute. She was nice but seemed awkward talking to me so I left her alone.\n\n59 - 11/04 - I got off the bus at the same time as a really cute girl.  I asked if she knew where some street was and asked her where she was headed. She started acting weird so I stopped talking to her.\n\n60 - 11/05 - Sat down in front of a pretty girl on the trolley and talked to her until my stop came up. Got lots of smiles and IOIs. Asked for her number but she said she didn't have one.\n\n61 - 11/07 - Went up to a cute redhead sitting by the languages building. Asked her if she knew where some class was and complemented her on her hair. She said thanks but stopped making eye contact.\n\n62 - 11/07 - Walked over to a girl who always hangs out around the same spot as me and asked her for her name and introduced myself. We had a small conversation and I'll be seeing her every other day at school.\n\n63 - 11/07 - I was walking by a bus stop and saw a cute girl with red streaks in her hair. I went over to talk to her but she wasn't too responsive and her friend I thought was a chick turned out to be a dude.\n\n64 - 11/07 - Still walking around, I see a cute chick dressed all sexy so I stopped her to ask where some street was. Before I could even hit on her, she started acting all bitchy/uninterested so I kept walking.\n\n65 - 11/07 - I was on a date with this hot girl I had met on the bus. She had to go to the bathroom so while I was waiting for her to get back, this really attractive blonde walks by with her labrador. I reached down to pet the dog and started talking to the chick. I got her name and found out she was neighbors with a friend who lived next to that park.\n\n66 - 11/08 - Saw a pretty girl sitting in the back of the bus so I sat a seat away from her and immediately engaged her in conversation over the new school class catalog she had. We talked about school, beer, dancing, and she introduced herself. She was in a hurry and ran out of the bus before I could go for the number close.\n\n67 - 11/08 - Sat down next to a cute girl at school and asked her what she was up to. First few seconds went well until she clearly acted uninterested.\n\n68 - 11/08 - Sat next to a good looking girl on the bus. Saw she had a school catalog so I talked to her about school. I tried to keep the conversation going but she was being too quiet.\n\n69 - 11/08 - Saw a cute/hot goth chick I always see working at school at the trolley station. I went over to her and said: \"hey...I always see you at school.\" We talked on the trolley and I did a bit of joking around/teasing her and it worked well...got her smiling and laughing a lot. When we got off on our stop, I asked for her number. She didn't have a cell phone but she gave me her name instead to find her on FB. Later at night we talked for a bit and we're planning to hang out soon.\n\n70 -  11/09 - Saw a couple of cute girls talking by some apartments while I was skating and went over to talk to them. Started off by asking for directions. Got a half assed reply so I continued skating.\n\n71 - 11/10 - Saw a cute Asian girl wearing a shirt with Kanji writing on my way to the school library, so I said to her: \"I like your shirt.\" Completely ignored but I'm glad I got myself to do it.\n\n72 - 11/10 - On my way to class, I saw another really cute girl. She had pink socks pulled up pretty high, so I tried stopping her by saying \"I like your socks.\" She said: \"thanks\" with a huge grin/smile but didn't slow down. \n\n73 - 11/10 - I was hanging out by the CIS buildings and went over to a pretty chick and asked her what she was up to. Didn't get much of a response so I went over to the next set.\n\n74 - 11/10 - Still by the CIS buildings, I go over to a 3 set and ask them if they were in a CIS class and what they were doing. One of them said nothing and the other two just stared so I ejected. \n\n75 - 11/10 - While exiting the library by my house, I saw a really pretty girl sitting on a bench. I went over to ask her where some street was and asked her what she was doing. She kept nervously laughing and not answering so I just went on my way.\n\n76 - 11/11 -  Saw some lady walking out of a restaurant while I was walking by. I asked her if she knew where some other restaurant was. We talked for a little bit and she was really nice. Couldn't shift the conversation though so I just thanked her and walked away.\n\n77 - 11/12 - Went over to a hot girl sitting at a bus stop bench and asked her when the trolley came by. She wasn't very responsive.\n\n78 - 11/12 - Asked a lady on the trolley if she knew how long we were from the first stop. I don't think she spoke English though because she looked at me all confused and showed me her phone repeatedly.\n\n79 - 11/12 - Got off on the last trolley station on the way to a party and saw a really cute chick. I went over to her to ask if she knew where some bus stop was. She said she had no idea but offered to help by looking it up on her smart phone. After talking to her a while I found out she was from Florida and had just moved here. I got her number and we talked for a while longer. Out of nowhere, some random psycho went up to her getting really close to her and talking in a low voice. I could tell she was creeped out so I told him to back off. Almost got in a fight but the guy got the point and left. She mentioned to me it was a good thing I was around. I waited with her until her friend got there...also a cute chick whom she introduced me to. \n\n80 - 11/13 - The next morning, on my way back from the party, I was walking up my street and I saw some lady walking the opposite way. Tried stopping her by asking her if she knew where some street was but she just said no and kept walking. \n\n81 - 11/13 - During my break at work I went inside a clothing store where I saw a cute girl on a computer searching through the store's catalog. I went over to her and asked her if she was shopping on the computer. She just said \"no\" and walked away. I think she was really shy.\n\n82 - 11/14 - On my way to the bus, I saw an extremely gorgeous girl. I asked her how to get to some street to stop her. She actually stopped and I asked her what she was up to. I found out she goes to the same college as me. Got her name but for some stupid reason I didn't ask her number. Hopefully I see her again.\n\n83 - 11/14 - Moved seats on the bus to get closer to a pretty chick. Asked her if she was going to the same school (she was) and I asked her about her classes. She asked me about mine and we had a small conversation until it turned to me just asking questions, so I let the conversation die.\n\n84 - 11/14 - Saw a cute girl walking the opposite way so I asked her where some building was. She told me she didn't know, so I tried shifting the conversation but she was in a hurry.\n\n85 - 11/14 - Went to a little park I never go to a few blocks from home. Saw 4 really good looking chicks kicking a soccer ball back and forth. I went up and asked one of them where the public library was. She gave me directions and I asked her if they were in a group. She seemed nice and said they were just friends but she started walking away.\n\n86 - 11/14 - I went up to a really cute girl using the library's book searching computer. I asked if she could show me how to use it to start a conversation with her. She helped me out but she was in a hurry and walked off.\n\n87 - 11/15 - Got on the bus and saw a cute girl in the back section so I sat a seat away from her. I immediately recognized her from somewhere though I had never met her. I started talking to her and found out we had a mutual friend. We exchanged names but I didn't ask for her number because I have a date with her friend tomorrow and that could make things awkward.\n\n88 - 11/15 - Saw a pretty girl sitting on a bench in front of the parking lot in school. I asked if she knew where some parking lot section was. I shifted the conversation to school and we talked for a little until the conversation went nowhere so I told her I had to go.\n\n89 - 11/15 -  I went up to another pretty girl who was sitting on the grass on another part of school. Went up to her and asked her something but I got completely ignored.

{"body":"Yeah man it's super thrilling, especially when you get to that moment where you know you've locked her in - at least for the moment - and have an opportunity to really build something. \n\nAs great as Wygant is, to be honest he's pretty repetitive (just try and count how many times he uses Whole Foods as an example...impossible), so whatever you listen will probably be ok, he really hits the same points home over and over. There's a pickup podcast with him that's good, start there. \n\nFor my money though, The Blueprint De-Coded was much more helpful. Wygant, as good of a teacher as he is, is ultimately still coming from a \"natural\" viewpoint, and so it's at times hard to really understand what he's saying. It's the kind of stuff where I feel like if I come and re-listen to it a year from now, I'll get a lot more out of it. \n\nTyler Durden was as structured as PUAs come, and so his analytical disposition allows him to explain a concept as broad and difficult as \"being yourself and being confident\" down to very actionable and relatively easy to understand steps. His stuff on state game and \"resistance\" is very, very helpful. Start there. ","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

Just sit in that same spot, maybe get there early so she can make the decision to sit next to you if she wants. This ain't over yet!\n\nAs for improvising, that's a good insight. You know that perfect pick-up you have in your head? The one where everything goes right, you say this that and another smooth line and blady blah blah and it's like in a movie? NOT GONNA HAPPEN! It MIGHT happen once, after you've really been working your game and you have one of those nights you can't seem to fuck up no matter how hard you try. However, don't ever count on it. Pick-up is messy, it's a struggle but realize that if a girl is into you and you're not a total doug, she's gonna give you opportunities to make up for it. Don't sweat the mistakes, power through and keep at it.\n\nAlso, you don't need another opening man, forget openers! Just work on being present and yourself. Here's your opening: some comment about your professor, or the homework you just had. Just start a convo, don't get caught up in creating the \"perfect opener\", because it doesn't exist.\n\nSince you're a total n00b, I don't know how much you've read. I'm not much further along, but to save you some time here's some advice: a lot of pick-up advice is bullshit. Listen to David Wygant, watch The Blueprint De-Coded. Anything that has you focusing more on technical ability rather than inner game is a mistake. Inner game, inner game, inner game. Focus ALL your efforts on conversational ability, inner game and staying in the moment, don't worry too much about kino, etc until you are able to be utterly yourself in front of an HB10.

{"body":"Alright folks. I made some \"approaches\" the other night but I'm not sure if I want to count them or not. \n\nMy roommate had a few strangers over, girls and guys, and I befriended them all before I left for another party. \n\nApproach #1: I find it really easy to talk to guys. I'm a rather comical dude so I just free-flow with my personality and calibrate from there - if people dig it wild I go wild, if people are slightly put off I tone it down and see what makes them laugh and go from there. Anywhoo, these people were all quite friendly and friends of my roommate who I'm pretty close to so it wasn't much of a challenge. I know one of the girls is interested me schoolgirl crush style (roommate tells me and she makes it obvious) but I'm pretty put off by this girl - just something about her, even the way she smells (it's not bad, just a disagreeable scent to my olfactory). It's really great to be around her though because I feel like the man and naturally kino on her, do dominant things. It's the girls I'm attracted to and don't know that I have less experience with..\n\nApproach #2: I went to another party and knew most people there unfortunately. Talked to a friend's girlfriend (wow she's so hot) that I'd never talked to and got some sneaky eyes from her, which is always nice. I'd always been intimidated by how attractive she is but she's quite friendly and I had no trouble leading the conversation and maintaining eye contact strongly. Progress!\n\nBut this sort of social situation I don't want to be the norm for the challenge. I want to be approaching STRANGERS, preferably women I'm attracted to, in public. \n\nSo I've refined the challenge a bit. And it's for the better, as the girl I'm seeing has been talking more hold of me than I'd like to admit and I could be with a better woman, I admit. \n\nTime to get back out there!

I know it's a crutch, but this is where I am at right now. I ended up doing 4 approaches:\n\n#3. Went up to a girl that was wearing some sort of sash and other shit and asked her what she won. It was a bachelorette party and we ended up talking about the most embarrassing sex stories. I practiced avoiding questions and challenged her to tell her story. It was a pretty large group but it was just four of us talking. Her friend was pretty attractive, but I didn't get to build as much rapport with her. At some point, they had to go to their next challenge or something, whatever that is. I should've asked the friend for her number, but I didn't. Oh well.\n\n#4. My friend (who is a natural) was ogling some girls in a very large mixed group, wondering how to get to them. I told him to challenge me and just went up to the group, sitting down at an available seat, and asked them who they were, since they were so diverse. I got introduced to a couple of people but I got the most interest from one of the two hot girls we were interested in. Since it was loud, I just said I was going to sit next to them and shamelessly moved there. We chatted for a bit but they had to go after a while. I really should've asked the girl I was talking to for her number, but I didn't because it felt weird (which is a stupid excuse). We spent a few more minutes with the group that was left, but it was basically all guys so we gracefully ejected.\n\n#5. There were fewer people in the bar by now, but there was a group of 3 girls and 3 guys, which looked sort of approachable. After a bit of procrastination, I went up to them and asked them how they all knew each other. I got more or less ignored by 5 of the 6 people, but one girl responded. So I grabbed a chair and sat with them, and they opened up more. My friend immediately joined in, we chatted with the group for a while, and eventually I felt it was time to eject so we said bye to them and left.\n\n#6. This is the one I am most proud of. I guess I was warmed up by then. As we were walking away from the previous group, I saw one girl sitting there and just immediately went to her. I noticed there was a second drink on her table and said I was going to keep her company until her partner came back. She was quite receptive to that, so I sat down, and her friend, who wasn't attractive, joined soon after. She sat at an adjacent table but I urged her to join us, and my friend soon swooped in as well. The four of us chatted for a while, usually in pairs. I made sure to not try and compete with my buddy for the hot one, so that when he was talking to her, I was talking to the other one, and vice versa. Both girls were pretty interesting and fun, so it wasn't too hard. At some point, I realized I should really try for a number close on the hotter one and kept looking for a good opportunity. It was soon last call and the bar was closing, so the two girls were leaving. I said, \"Hey, you two are pretty cool, we should hang out some time. Give me your number.\" The hot one wrote down her full name (at my insistence) and number on a piece of paper, but one of the digits looked super iffy, so I'm not sure I got it right. I texted the number immediately (they left by then), but no response yet. If I get no response tomorrow, I'll look her up on facebook and message her that she wrote her number down illegibly.\n\nAlright, just 94 more to go!","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

I head home for a second at the end of lunch, run into the neighbor from upstairs. I've said hi to her once or twice but never talked. She's walking out, and I open with, \"hey, you feel that?\" She knows right away what I'm talking about, we talk about where we were when it hit, blah blah blah.

{"body":"#1: A few days ago, my dad was visiting me and we were in a cafe. This girl came in and sat down next to us. I noticed she opened up a calculus book so when she came back from ordering at the counter, I asked her what she was studying. Then I asked her what her major was. They way she responded made it sound like she was pretty happy to have a conversation with me, and it would've been pretty easy to change the subject at that point, but I used the fact that I was with my dad as an excuse to stop the conversation by wishing her luck with her studies.\n\n#2: It was a friend's birthday today and I didn't really know anybody there, except for one other friend who left early. At some point, I sat down next to a girl that was eating some sandwich, and said something stupid like, \"That looks really good.\" She asked me my name, and I weaseled out of it and managed to ask for her name instead, which she also weaseled out of, so I said I'll call her \"weirdo\" and she should call me that too. I bantered with her for a bit but decided it would be better to walk away, so I went and got a drink. I later chatted with her more, discovered she was married to somebody else at the party, and chatted with him too. I felt like she gave me a few subtle IOIs as her and I talked later, but I wasn't going to act on it for obvious reasons. I did a bit of friendly kino like touching her knee (actually more like her thigh :D) to empathize a point, but that's it. I'm sure I'll see her and her husband again, and I actually liked both of them, so I didn't want to make it weird.","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

There's a two-set at the bar I'm trying to get him to talk to, but it's not happening.  Eventually I just go in.  I sit to the right of my target and say, I don't remember.  Probably something along the lines of, \"so what's going on in here tonight?\"  Target says it's her first time, I say it's mine, too.  We get chatting.  Her friend reaches over and says, \"Hi, I'm Jessica.\"  IOI.  It was a funny interaction because she changed her name to London, but her friend was saying, \"Jessica\" still.  Then my target takes the \"Jessica\" moniker.  So I make fun of them for a bit about that.  My target says she was conceived in London and that her sister was born in Milan.  I say, \"So, your parents basically took a trip to Europe and fucked their way across the country?\"  LOL.\n\nWe talk some more and they try to get me to bounce to another bar with them.  Now, AFC NLA would've gone with them.  Not this guy.  I said, \"No, we're going home.  But why don't you give me your number and we can hang out again.\"  She ended up telling me she doesn't give out her number (probably a way to get around this that I don't know yet), and I was a little clumsy about it by not taking my phone out, but she took my number.  Her friends had left her at this point, so it was just me and her, and I of course took my sweet time in giving it to her, interspersing my digits with stories.\n\nLong story short, she took my number at 1a and at 3a I got a text from an unknown number: \"Hiiiiiii.\"  Lol.

I stopped at a table outside and asked for a cigarette for my way home.  They gave me a hard time so I stayed in set and played with them.  Apparently they did not own the cigarettes and had tried giving them away earlier and yadda-yadda, the owner came out eventually so I bummed a butt from her.  By this time I was hooked in the group.  Sat around talking.  They thought I was Canadian, so I played with that a bit.  The bitch I was talking to was a (self-proclaimed) bitch, but I disarmed her.  Bitches love it when you disarm them.  We were talking, so I went inside and #-closed her.  I'm not proud of this as I'm not that attracted to her, but I am proud that I went for it.  **Close 8**\n\nAfter the girls left, one of the guys I know from going to this bar tried to get me to go to the same club I was at last night.  I didn't want to go, but went anyway (one of my goals lately is to say \"yes\" more).  Did a mini-bar-crawl on the way there (wherein I opened every set I see) and eventually get there.  There's a band playing.  I open the first set I see of two really cute girls.  We talk about how the band currently playing sucks.  At some point I am outside talking with them about philosophy, god and evolution.  Wow, that was deep.\n\nBack in the club.  Two girls from the other bar are there (the one I #-closed and her cute friend).  A good band comes on and I tell those girls \"I'm going to dance like no one's watching.\"  Commence dancing.\n\nI dance like a madman talking to everyone I see.  I see a fat girl and her mom in the corner and try to get them to dance.  Mom is receptive, fat girl not so much.  I don't care.  I go back to dancing.  Talking to a hippy girl and her friend who won't dance.  Try to get friend to dance.  Yadda-yadda, I number close them both.

Next time I'll try sitting in the main shopping street and wait for girls to pass me, it sure beats walking around in the heat for ages.\n\nI'll try this again at the weekend, as there's bound to be way more people about, and hopefully my approach count won't remain 0!","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}
{"body":"December 14th-17th\n\n* Total: 23 \n\n* **HB Sets: 14** \n\nMemorable sets:\n\n* Start talking to a dude in the common area of the hotel we're staying in. He turns out to be pretty cool, from Spain, and has mad tips about places to party in a new city I'm visiting in a few weeks.\n\n* **I open an M/F set at a bar**. Turns out they're together, but still mad cool. I'm supposed to go fix their computer, and then we're going to get a drink and she says she'll bring a friend. We'll see if this happens\n\n* **A lot of kino with one member of an FFF 3set.** 3set is good, as I'm out in a group of 3. She turns out to be 18. They leave. We're offered a ride and end up bumbling and denying it. We should have taken it, as they expressed interest in getting high and we had weed. STUPID! But lesson learned. I was also out with SHITTY wings, I think if we were more together we would have pulled through on that one. They did wanna Facebook though, I'm down.\n\n* **I opened an FFF 3set**, and one of my wings ends up kissing a chick almost immediately. The power of the drunken caveman! I have a failed k-close later, but do #close. I'm not really into her and she is in a city I rarely pass through, so that's a dead end.\n\n* **Hitting on middle aged women in the line at the mall is awesome.** They're really fun to talk to.\n\n* I'm walking to a bar. It starts to downpour. We're by a gun shop, and they have a tent set up with a few people grilling under it. We go over there. They get us drunk, let us play with the guns in the shop, and are generally super fucking crazy. Maybe we'll go hunting sometime.\n\n* **At a club, I think I try to open 4 sets with HBs.** All are blowouts. 1 dance floor blowout, one smoking section stare of death, one girl is receptive to my chatting but some dude comes and takes her away, and my last set I open the dude in an FMF but even he isn't eating up my compliments on his really awesome scarf. It was awesome, seriously.\n\n* **#close but the interaction wasn't going well.** Wasn't surprised when number was fake.\n\n* **open a mixed set and end up #closing an HB2.** I feel cruel, it was only for my self-esteem and I was totally disinterested. She called me 2 days later, at midnight, and I didn't answer. \n\n* **[read a field report about a botched HB6](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/nhux8/fr_escalation_anxiety/)**\n\nThe biggest thing I've noticed about trying to game everyone is how much more interesting my life has become in just a few days. I think the idea of \"gaming everyone\" needs more promotion on seddit.

I could have continued the conversation, but coffee was still kicking in, and I just started to read the newspaper.  I said \"Good morning!\" to the bus driver and a friend of a girl who I went on a Day 2 with saw me.  I reintroduced myself and we talked for about 5 minutes until she had to get off.  The girl with the belt also got off and said, \"See you around.\"  I think I could have gotten her phone number if I had continued the conversation with her.  Oh well.

{"body":"100 girls...I have AA but it's not THAT intense. I make approaches, just not enough of them. I guess I should maybe write up a more detailed plan, but for example, at night I'll get too focused on one set. I think a big part of this is the fact that I wait way too long to open that first set. So for example, I'll open at like 12:45, bar is closing at two, I'll be in that set for half hour, and if it falls apart I just say \"fuck it\" and don't bother going for a second since the bar is closing in 45 minutes.\n\nCompare this to where I was say, 3 months ago...where I had paralyzing AA and would NOT approach anyone, even at a party where it's so easy because everyone knows everyone else through other people there. I guess I'm kind of at an in-between stage, where I want to focus on opening more often and transitioning more smoothly when I do open.

She then started talking to the bouncer, so I started talking to these two swedish guys.  I then introduced them to her (MISTAKE!) and proceeded to get blown out of the set as one talked to her and the other ran interference on me.  Jeez, that stunk.  \n\nSecond set was on Saturday afternoon on my way to work.  I stopped at starbucks.  I noticed some hottie was probably standing behind me, but I didn't look.  I ordered my drink and went somewhere.  She ordered her drink and went somewhere.  Once I got a good look at her, I saw she was hot and hispanic (my favorite combo).  So I went over to her and said, \"what did you get?\"  I thought I heard \"banana latte,\" but we later realized I misheard her and she said \"vanilla latte.\"  We fucking laughed about that.  Next we talked about salsa and I told her that I am just learning.  She said she's going to the \"Congress\" next weekend.  Here is where I get the phone-number but I just fail.

{"body":"I need to be better at updating this, it's mostly that nothing much has happened these few days so I sort of let them build up. From now on I need to post here like every day.\n\nMonday was a weird day for the challenge, I spent it with my roommate and didn't spend much time out of the apartment. We did go to gamestop and so while we were looking for someone to open. Ended up making some real awkward small talk with someone there about whether you can have too many video games. Anyways, 8 down, 92 to go.\n\nI also used my new found social skills to ask someone who worked there for info on a game I normally would have just looked up online. He gave me faulty information, haha.\n\nAgain, Tuesday I went to meet a friend for coffee and made some small talk with a dude sitting beside me while I waited. 9 down, 91 to go.\n\nHad a new class on Wednesday so I met a lot of new people, must have talked to 6 new people, a few people I've met before. I honestly would have opened everyone but I don't want to look like I'm trying to talk to everyone and in a lot of classes it sort of looks unnatural if someone talks to anyone besides who they're next to. Art students can be pretty introverted. So we jump up, 15 down, 85 to go.\n\nI think I made some other small talk but honestly can't remember, bad for the numbers game but honestly I'm just making meeting new people a part of my life and just being more open so now talking to a stranger isn't as groundbreaking as it used to be.\n\nSaw a girl having trouble operating the printer in the library, told her how to work it, small talk, good times. 16 down, 84 to go.\n\nSaw an incredibly hot and very tall Asian girl I recognized from one of my classes standing outside, so I went up and asked if she recognized me. She did, we chatted, it went relatively OK. She kept looking past me but she was waiting for a bus. But screw it, it went fantastic because I had the balls to talk to her even though she was hella intimidating. 17 down, 83 to go.\n\nMet up with a girl I know from class, got on the elevator and a hot girl starts talking to her. I get into the conversation, it goes well, I introduce myself and bam, we're on our floor. Really great interaction and this girl I know, short, quiet, shy girl looks at me with this great expression and says \"And you think you're shy?\" Haha, I had told her it can take a while for me to fully open up last week. I tell her I have to try hard to be this social and she says she can't tell. If that isn't proof this is working I don't know what is. 18 down, 82 to go.\n\nOpened some dude to ask ask what movie was playing on the communal TV at school, turned out it was Commando, had fun making fun of it. 19 down, 81 to go.\n\nAlso worth noting I saw a girl from last year that I had a big crush on. I still sort of do. It's kind of hard for me to read her emotions, she's a bit of an introvert and she's Korean, so cultural differences don't make it easier. Still, she was a little less happy to see me than I would have hoped, but it still was friendly enough. Honestly, it's small but just a short while ago small stuff like that would have gotten me down but now that I'm coming from a better placed with less of a scarcity mindset I was able to roll with the punches and I think improve my situation. \n\nAnd have a good time, the biggest thing about this is that it's just making my life more open and more interesting.","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}
{"body":"Alright made my first approaches for this last night. But was also got way too drunk so I barely remember any of the details. I did 3 though. First was an Asian HB7 on the dancefloor, just danced with her for a few minutes. Don't remember how the conversation went, just remember her claiming to be 30, I said that was bullshit and that she looked 23/24...she said she actually just turned 25? I don't get why she'd lie. Then started saying she was engaged. I said \"That's cool, it's just dancing\"...or something like that. At one point she left and said she'd be back but I didn't see her again. She was being smiley/positive though, not bitchy. Whatev.\n\nThe second one I have no idea how the conversation went, but it was at the bar while we were both waiting for the bartender. I do know I was making her laugh A LOT. But since I was a drunk idiot I wasn't even thinking about game so I didn't escalate the interaction or anything.\n\nThird one I got blown out by a group of girls on the dance floor. It was 4 or 5 and one fat, short dude prob in his mid-30s grinding up on the one girl and she was all about it. It made no sense to me. I started talking to him, saying \"You know something I don't man, tell me what you know.\" Then after I got blown out asked his name and pretended like I knew him with the girls, haha. That didn't work.\n\nAnyway, 3 down, 97 to go. Oh and I need to never drink that much again.

I see that the cutest girl in the set is talking very lively with her hands.  I say something C-F like, \"you must not care about what you're saying at all.\"  Something like that, I don't remember what.  It really doesn't matter what I say because somehow I hooked into the set.  I was rocking, making eye-contact with everyone and having a good time.  The guy of the set actually winged me.

I walked over to her and asked if she knew when the bus would get there. I asked her what she was up to and told her I was waiting for a friend. She said she was waiting for her brother to get out of school so we talked for a while. After the first few minutes, she opened up started talking a lot and we exchanged contact info. She didn't have a number but gave me her email and FB and said she'd take me to the mall next time she goes. She told me she didn't have a pic of herself on her FB so when I asked her why, she said she'd put one up for me. As we got up to go our separate ways, I put my arm around her to hug her and she went in for a kiss on the cheek. \n\n92 - 11/15 - On my way to the library I saw a really hot chick randomly standing on the sidewalk looking at her phone.

Asked her what she was reading and we talked about our classes for a while. We only exchanged names.\n\n95 - 11/16 - Told a pretty girl at school I liked her hair as she walked by. She said thanks but didn't slow down. \n\n96 - 11/16 - Switched seats on the bus to sit in front of a pretty hot chick. I turned around and tried to start a conversation. Got an uninterested reply and she didn't bother taking her ear phones off. \n\n97 - 11/17 - Walked by a good looking red head at school and asked her if she knew the location of some building. Complemented her on her hair but got the hint she wasn't interested.\n\n98 - 11/17 - Asked a really pretty girl walking next to me how to get to the tutoring center. Asked her what she was up to and we chatted for a little and exchanged names.\n\n99 - 11/17 - Got in line at a coffee stand at school and asked a cute girl who was eating something from it if it was good. We talked for a little bit but she started acting awkward so I went on about my business.\n\n100 - 11/17 - Tried stopping an attractive girl walking the opposite way on the sidewalk to ask her something.

I did not meet my aggressive deadline, but I will push out the deadline until 10/17.\n\nI'm trying to remember what I did last weekend - last Thursday night I bitched out so 0 for then.  On Friday 10/7 - I went to uptown Dallas with a wing and it was seriously crowded because of the Texas/OU game.  We ended up finding a place that wasn't too crowded - 6 opens here.  Last Saturday 10/8 - my car broke down so ended up being stuck with my co-workers and went to an arts festival.  I made it a point to talk to everyone there, but didn't do any true \"openers\" I guess.  Also made a realization that I don't want to hang out with these people anymore because they are too freaking negative.\n\n**Thursday night, 10/14** - I went out semi-solo in downtown Fort Worth.  When I go by myself, I find it best to bounce between a lot of venues to keep momentum going.  I tried a new diner before I went out, then hit up two nearby bars to that and opened a few sets at each of those places.  I then headed to the downtown area and ended up meeting with my wing.  We went to a latin dance-type club (and it's pretty hard to keep the interaction going there if you don't know the dances, but I found out that there is going to be free lessons next Thursday) - then bounced to a college bar.  \n\nI ended up spotting two girls I work with and talked with them for a bit, then my wing comes and sits down at the table and I found out after the fact that he had opened them without knowing that I knew who they were.  *This is the kind of situation I always feared and would play out horribly in my headt, but after the fact it really wasn't a big deal at all.*  Guys have been hitting on girls since the dawn of time, and my wing just moved on after chatting with them for a bit because there were plenty of women at this locale.  I said my goodbyes and bounced by myself to a different venue that I wanted to check out (also I don't want my coworkers to see me sarging).  The next venue was tiny and no one was there, so I jetted back to the latin club and finished out my night there with about 12 opens for the night.\n\nLesson learned - I *really* want to learn salsa dancing! ;) I have enough confidence to open on the dance floor and my sense of humor will get me through like two songs, but ultimately - the girl wants a man to lead and to be swept off her feet.  I had more luck talking near the bar then bouncing to the dance floor than opening on the dance floor, but still no closes at that place.

Sadly, she got up and walked away.\n\n#14. Sat down next to this girl that was sitting and introduced myself. I asked her what she was drinking and she said water. I tried starting a conversation but she wasn't very receptive. At some point she mentioned her husband so I asked where he was and she said dancing. I tried to make it out to not be a big deal that she's married (since I wasn't trying to sleep with her or anything), but she wasn't really into having a conversation with me and it was going nowhere, so I ejected by saying I was going to go get some water.\n\n#15. Danced up to these two girls and said something really mundane to one of them. Then asked one of them her name, and she told me and then told me her friend's name. It didn't really go anywhere after that, and I sort of danced next to them for a bit and then danced away.\n\n#16. Danced up to this girl and asked her if she was wearing a wig. She was but for some reason she thought it was rude to ask. After a really short exchange, she danced away from me. I'm really not clear why it's rude if she really was wearing a wig and I called it. Whatever.\n\n\nI #-closed the girl I came with, but that was before we even got there. I was hoping to get further with her but whatever.

{"body":"**11/18/11** -- went out with a few BAS'ers.  Best set was probably the first one of the night with some dancer at the bar.  Didn't number close her, but at end of convo she said, \"I'm sure I'll be seeing you again.\"  Later saw her and had a chance to reopen.  Wish I did, but c'est la vie.\n\nLater went to a different bar where there were shot girls.  Opened them and were talking to them for quite a bit.  Made some good attraction, but did not go for the number close for w/e reason.  I was feeling weird that night.\n\nLast bar was a bit of a disaster.  I didn't have any terrible sets, but no great ones either.\n\n**11/22/11**  Went out with boss to cheap bar with cute bartender.  Flirted with bartender a bit before going home.\n\n**11/23/11** Waiting for snarkymcchoad at our usual meetup spot.  I am sitting all alone when HB Cougar sits right next to me at the bar.  Everything's an IOI, so I open her.  We get to talking about stuff (her job, her drink, this bar, etc.) and have great convo.  Eventually, a couple of BAS'ers show up, so I introduce them into the set.  At some point we get to talking with this chick about being naked.  She casually drops in the convo something about \"my boyfriend.\"  But I am non-reactive, so I don't care.  I just keep plowing.  Eventually, it's time to leave so I say, \"Hey, we should hang out and get a drink at [bar from a previous conversation thread].  Gimme your number and we'll hang out.\"  As a side note, this #-close was in front of my two wings -- something I would *never* have been able to do before.  I used to hate closing i/f/o other people, but now it's no big deal.  I open up the \"new contact\" page on my phone and lock it in.  I think kennotheking gets a picture of us (good wing, man.).  **Close 21**\n\nSame night, we head to a different bar.  I open some chick as soon as I walk in by giving her shit about what she's drinking.  This is a beer bar, so I give her shit about drinking liquor.  I also see a twoset I had previously spoke to the week before at this same bar, so I go and reopen them.  There's another set I was talking to as well, but it didn't go that well.\n\nThird bar, and we're just chilling in the back.  I tell my boys to go open a set and a have a seat at the bar myself.  While the boys are in set, I see a twoset next to me and open them.  Turns out one of the chicks was from the second bar, so I have a bit of social proof and lock in.  I get some pictures with both girls (having the one take pictures of the other), then close the one I think was cuter.  I could have closed them both, but didn't for some reason.  I later sent one of the pictures to the girl I closed and have been texting a bit back and forth with her.  **Close 22**\n\n**November 26, 2011**  Go to a party with some close 19.  Full FR is up on my blog.  This same night, close 10 asked me out.  Anyway, at the party I am talking to everyone and number close this girl whom I think is real cute.  **Close 23**.  I try closing another cutey with FB close, but it doesn't happen, unfortunately.  She has a boyfriend but was showing me serious attraction.  C'est la vie.  I got three good closes last week.  What did you do? :)\n\n**Edit** turns out, not only did I fb close the cutey, but #-closed too.  Wow, I must have been on autopilot and totally forgot.  When I texted her the next day, I thought she was close 23.  Turns out she was **close 24**\n\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

I walk in, and am about to sit 2 seats away from an HB7.\n\nThen I remember to myself, \"Shit, I'm supposed to open 100 sets, what the FUCK am I doing?\" I move to the seat next to her and say, \"Hope you don't mind if I sit here, I think that seat's a lefty\", pointing out that the desk thingy was on the left side (excuse helped me with my AA and was a nice save to prevent an awkward transition).\n\nWe talk a little bit before class starts and we talk mostly about the school, the class etc. but then the lecturer gets started. \n\n10 minute break in the middle, we get a nice conversation going about why we're in the class, what we hope to do, and I joke around a bit about her major and everything looks good.

{"body":"**Day 10** Getting better.  \n\nWas feeling like shit Saturday night after being sick all day.  But I had made plans with an AFC friend, so said, \"fuck it.\"  I got my shit together and headed over to my friend's house to pregrame.  Stopped at the atm, which would not give me money.  NO WORRIES.  I AM UNAFFECTED.  Go to friend's house.  Meet his gf.  Get some beer to pregame it.  People start rolling in and we prepare to go out.\n\nBackstory:  The original plan was to head to a bar in Cupertino where my friend knew the bartender.  Apparently, the goal of the night was to get this one single guy laid (it's not my group of friends, I just know the main guy).  But, the girls we were going out with revolted against the Cupertino idea, so we are now going to downtown San Jose.  We were talking about/deciding where to go.  Being a leader of men, I suggested a bar where everyone could be happy (Tres Gringos for you locals), and my friend and his girl accept.\n\nGetting there:  We take separate cars.  I get there first and there is NOBODY else there from our group.  I'm feeling like shit still from being sick, but man up.  First order of business is to hit the restroom.  As I am walking back to it, I notice the ladies checking me out (something that is happening more and more as I tweak and improve my inner game).  All I can think as I'm walking is 1) game on; and 2) \"I'm taken\" (a disqualification routine stolen from Style).  I make a mental note of HB 2-set at the well of the bar and continue on.\n\nSET ONE:  Come out of the bathroom.  Tons of prospects in here tonight.  I make sure everyone sees me and keep a big smile on my face.  Next order of business is to get a drink.  I go back to the well of the bar where I saw the HB 2-set.  I slide in next to them and say, \"I can't stay long, I'm just ordering a drink.\"  I then say, \"what are you guys celebrating?\"  I wish I could remember details better for you guys, but I'm so in the moment it's tough to remember.  Basically, I try to mix heavy cold reads with great rapport and emotional connections.  \n\nCome to find out that the two HBs are sisters.  I get a good vibe going with them.  I make fun of them for drinking PBR.  \"Oh, high class are we?\" :)  The younger sister says I should buy her sister a drink but I say, \"I don't buy drinks for women unless I know them really well.\"  At some point, my friend shows up with a big smile and gives me huge social proof.  I order him and myself a drink.  The younger sister goes to the bathroom and the older one goes out to smoke a cigarette, telling me that's what she's about to do.  I say, \"I'll join you in a minute.\"\n\nThis set isn't even all that interesting.  Basically, it's a warmup set.  I get deep rapport going with the HB older sister.  She gives me a cigarette and stays with me until I finish mine even after she's done with hers (a compliance test I use).  At one point she drops the boyfriend bomb, and the younger sister isn't all that cute (HB7 or so), so I go back to my friends.\n\nSET TWO:  Go back to friends.  Find out who the single guy is.  Tell him we're going to talk to girls.  Find out his name (call him Shyguy).  Great.  I say, \"See those girls over there?  We're going to go talk to them.\"  I walk over.  I say, \"Hey, guys.  I want to introduce you to my friend.  He is the sunshine of my life and I think you should really meet him\" (lovingly stolen from Kumar).  They hook right away.  Great.  I pull Shyguy into the set and immediately iso my target.  She hooks.  Her friends leave and she stays.  Bingo.  I think about going for the kiss close, but miss my window.  NO WORRIES.  I get the number.  Basically hand her my phone and go to the bar to order a drink.  LIKE  A BOSS.  **Close 5**.\n\nI opened up two or three more sets for shyguy, but he couldn't stay in the set for more than a minute.  Also opened a two set by the door.  \"So, are you guys just going to stand there all night, or are you going to talk to people?\"  These girls had the bitch shields up strong and it took some work to break through, but I plowed through.  \"You guys should have fun.  It's my job to make sure everyone has fun.  So let's have fun!\"  I tell them they should hang out with my friends.  But they bore me, so instead of introducing them, I just go back to my group.  They look in every so often and then give off huge proximity alert, but by this time I am over it.\n\nSET THREE:  Go outside.  Steal a cigarette off of someone.  Start talking to this black girl and her hot blonde friend.  I am digging the black girl.  Finish my cigarette.  \"Listen, this has been fun, but I've got to catch up to my friends.  Here, give me your number and we'll hang out.\"  Hand her my phone.  She is skeptical, but puts it in.  **Close 6**\n\nCOUPLE OF TAKEAWAYS\n\n1.  JUST APPROACH.  I was feeling like shit all day.  Fuck it, I went out.  I had major AA at the venue.  Fuck it, just approach.  It may take you a little bit or a couple of sets to get warmed up, but just approach and you'll get over it.\n\n2.  Coming in indirect for a friend is gold.  Kumar, that one line (\"Here is so-and-so, the sunshine of my life.  I'd like you to meet him\") may be the single greatest opener of all time.\n\n3.  Girlfriends hate me.  Back when I was AFC, I could always be quick and easy friends with the girlfriends of friends.  But now, for whatever reason, they just don't like me.  Especially when they see me in the field.\n\n4.  Just approach.  I was with a group of AFCs.  They were all terrible wings.  W/e.  I got two number closes.\n\n5.  Be friendly with everyone.  Talk to everyone.  If you are the life of the party, people will want to be around you.  Example:  the girls kept saying how they were going to leave \"us guys\" at some point in the night.  They never did.  Sure, it may have had nothing to do with me, but I assume attraction.  So the only reason they stayed, was because of me ;)","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

{"body":"&gt;*As of Saturday morning on 10/1, I have about 88 left to go.*\n\n**Thursday night, 9/29** - I went out by myself in downtown Fort Worth.  I ended up running into a friend and chatted to him for a bit.  We then went our separate ways and I headed towards the bars.  It was dead.  The first venue I went into was very sparsely populated... I opened both sets and then left because there was nothing going on.  I sent out texts to see if there was anything going on in town, and no.  I wandered around to the other venues and it was pretty much the same story as the one where I just was, so I went home.  It had rained that evening and Texans apparently don't like that...\n\n**Friday night, 9/30** - Went out to uptown Dallas with a wing. Awesome night, opened a ton of sets - and it seemed like every set was hooking.  Me and my wing would point to sets for each other to open and then just charge in.  Interesting realization I had: I don't give a shit about being blown out by 7s after being in a group of 9s and making them laugh and having fun with them.  \n\nAnother realization - your opener doesn't matter a whole lot.  I had opened a few sets with \"I don't know if this is sexist, but have you ever met a female mechanic?\"  A few groups commented that I shouldn't be using that as my \"go-to line\" *and then proceeded to talk about the topic!* \n\nAfter I had a few openers down, it didn't really seem to matter what I opened with so I experimented a bit.  Over the course of the night, I managed to get free gum, a free drink, and a number (the girl lives an hour away though unfortunately).\n\nMore learning - at the end of the night (everyone was drunk at this point).  Some dude started giving me shit, telling me to fuck off, etc.  I respond neutrally - mainly because I have no freaking idea what he's so pissed about - and he's getting more aggressive.  So I open his female friends (9's!) using eye contact giving them the wtf look, and they apologize.  The girls are giving me and my wing strong IOIs, but the dudes keep \"accidentally\" bumping into me.  Wtf is this, high school?  Well I'm not about to fight four drunk dudes (2 v 4 is hardly fair and they each had a bit of size on us), and I don't think there was really a way to diffuse the situation being what it was so I had to eject.  I think I handled it exactly as I should have, and I find it enlightening that holding your own frame is so damn attractive to women!\n\n\n**What have I learned so far?**\n\nI need to push harder (in terms of escalation, etc.).  There is a lot that I can get away with that I am not going for.  I didn't meet any sort of \"red lights\" during the evenings or even get blown out that badly, which tells me that I should just plow on through until I get that feedback so I know where the threshold is.\n\nAlso, inner game is important and I am working hard to get that part of my life settled.  Last night was great for me in terms of solidifying some aspects of inner game.","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

Again, *just as I was about to do something* (yeah, sure) a wild guy appears and starts interacting and dancing with her.

{"body":"**DAY 12**  Good night.  There's been some interactions between days 11 and 12, but nothing of note.  Just normal flirting/ABG'ing.  \n\n**EDIT**: for TL;DR, skip down to \"The Good Stuff.\"\n\nOrganized the weekly south bay seddit meetup for last night, but it appeared no one was hanging out.  About to give up on the group when I got a text from justdoitt.  Says it's on, so I head home, shower, eat and change.  I head out to the bar.\n\nGet to the first spot.  It's pretty dead, but it's my spot so I like to use it as a jump off when I can.  As I walk in I make eye-contact with HB8 who has two drinks in front of her.  I was going to sit down in the open chair next to her (she was facing me full frontal and giving me a smile), but see it has a drink i/f/o it.  I haven't sarged in a bit and am a little miscalibrated, so instead of sitting down there like a boss and opening her, I sit in the chair next to the empty spot.  I say my hello's to the staff, order my drink, and watch highlights of the game.=  At some point, HB Tall comes and sits in the empty seat next to me.  It turns out they are a fourset of HBs7-9.\n\n&gt;= Optional Sidestory 1:  While I was there, these two choads came in and had no idea what they were doing.  I saw them come in and they basically just stood behind me the whole time.  I was sitting next to the only good-looking girls in the bar, so they were obviously waiting to open them, but had no fucking idea what to do.  Thank god we are all past that stage.\n\nAt some point, a cop comes in the bar and opens the fourset.  I'm just sitting there laughing to myself, texting and checking seddit to see what's going on.  HBCougars come in at some point and give me proximity IOIs, but I'm not all that interested.  That and I'm having some AA.  Eventually I say, \"fuck it,\" and open the girls to my right (the one where it was an empty seat when I walked in).  HB Tall is a 9 and closest to me.  Her cute friend, HB8 is next.  They are split from their two other friends who are talking to the cop.  I say, \"OK, who brought law.\" *smile.  HB9 qualifies, \"Oh, it wasn't me, I would never do that.\"  \"Listen,\" I say, \"if you gotta drop the dime, just tell me.\"  *smile.  We go into some playful banter about how she \"never buys drinks.\"  She's totally stuckup and I'm not fully in state yet, so it really doesn't go anywhere.  Plus, I forgot to engage her HB8 friend, who I was probably going to be more interested in.  The logistics were all wrong as I stayed in my seat and didn't move at all.  At some point I eject from the convo before I die of boredom and open HB Cougars to my left with, \"What's good in downtown San Jose on a Thursday night?\"  We talk a little, then it's time for me to jet.\n\n**LESSON ONE** Use warmup sets.  THEY ARE THE BEST WAY TO GET INTO STATE.\n\nHaving opened all the sets in the last bar (lol), I'm on the move.  No idea where the other BAS'ers are at this point, so it looks like I'm running solo.  Walk down the street and see something that instantly picks me up: there are these two guys talking to these two HB8s outside of a club.  They are completely cool and in charge.  It totally reminded me of my goals and what I'm looking to get out of this community.  It reinvigorated me.\n\n**Lesson TWO** Remember your goals and use them to propel you to success.\n\nSo I get to the second spot.  It's a complete Dive bar,  but tonight it's actually really crowded.  I ask the bouncer what's going on,^ and he says, \"here.\"  Lol.  So I'm in.  There's a seated fourset that I don't open right away even though they watch me come in (FUUUUUUUUUCK!  everyone has AA, guys).  I order a PBR (told you it was dive) and go to the bathroom to collect my thoughts.  Somebody knocks on the door.  When I come out there are two girls there so I tease them about the knocking.  At some point another girl comes out of the bathroom and talks to the two girls.  I tease her about blocking me in.  \n\n&gt;^ Optional Sidestory 2:  I always talk to the bouncer on my way in.  This is VERY important as it not only gives you social proof later, but it gives you social MOMENTUM as you walk in, and as one of the few people who gives the bouncer the time of day, you will be protected first in a fight if one should ever happen.  Just something as easy as, \"Is it good in there?  Any girls?\"  etc.\n\nHead back to the bar.  I see that the seated fourset has turned into an 8-set.  No fucking way I'm going in there.  Fuck.  Go to the front.  Having a good time.  There's a standing fourset that just arrived giving me proximity IOIs.  OK, fuck this shit.  I'm going in.\n\n**The good stuff**  This was a fourset I saw earlier when I stopped at the atm.  They were singing Sound of Music or some bullshit.  One chick had major sideboob and I decided if I saw them again, I'd open them.  I go in.  \"Hey.  Were you the guys singing earlier?\"  I open HB Sober (7), but HB Tall/Birthday (8) responds.  \"Yeah, probably.\"  Me:  \"You must be theatre majors.\"  HB Birthday/Tall.  \"I am.\"  Me: \"I thought you were wandering minstrels.\"  HB Drunk chimes in, \"What?\"  Me, ignoring her, \"Yeah, just wandering around, singing songs for a silver.\"  HB Drunk: \"Whhaaa you say?  Wandering menstrals?\"  LOLO.  Neg, rapport, repeat.  They are hooked.  Find out it's HB Talls birthday.  They are doing shots.  HB Drunk has me count down.  I am a baus.  The set is hooked, I'm in charge, they're laughing, they love me.  I say \"brb,\" go outside.  Try to bum a cigarette.  Nothing doing.  HB Drunk comes out, get one from her.  Mother hen who was buying the shots comes out.  She takes the cigarettes from me.  I say, \"Hey, easy there.  This one owes me a cigarette.\"  \n\n-Some shit happens here-  I don't want to go on forever.  We're just fucking chatting, having a jolly good time, the other two come out of the bar.  We're all talking.  They're qualifying.  Say they want to go dancing at Club X.  I say I know where it is.  They tell me I'm coming.  I resist.  They TELL ME I'M COMING.  LOL, ok.  Off we go and they bounce me.\n\nNow, at some point, and I don't know when, HB Hen takes a liking to me.  She's pretty cute, so I'm fine with it.  HB Hen takes my hand and we walk towards the club.  HB Drunk is fall down drunk at this point and asking everyone, \"HEY!  Do you know where club X is?!\"  At some point HB Sober takes over HB Hen duty while HB Hen, now dubbed HB Stacked, is busy flirting with me.  Here I mess up because I had a chance to get HB Birthday girl involved and hold her hand too.  Ah well, a player asks \"what could I have done different.\"  An afc is satisfied with where he is.\n\n**LESSON THREE** Always room for improvement.\n\n&gt;Optional Story 3:  At some point, we're walking to the club and HB Drunk says to me, \"Notlurkinganymoar.  We're not having a foursome, just so you know.\"  Oh.  My.  Lawd.  These girls are awesome.  I neg HB Drunk and playful rapport about the foursome we're now having.  One girl says, \"I have to pee.  If we don't get there, I'll pee on you.\"  The rest of them all, \"I have to pee, too.\"  Me: \"Well, if you all pee on me, that's sort of like a foursome.\"  LOL.\n\nEventually we get to the club.  Cover is $5.  I'm not paying for anyone.  HB Drunk pays in quarters.  They go to the bathroom.  I go to the bar.  I lose them so get my drink and go to the corner.  I see two of them dancing (HB Drunk and Sober).  I go over.  Start dancing.  Tell HB Sober I can babysit if she needs to pee.  She says she's fine.  We're dancing and HB Stacked comes over with HB Bithday Girl.  Now we're all dancing.  HB Stacked keeps -- what appears to me -- trying to push me out of the group.  I don't understand.  I keep moving around and dancing.  Then I see it.  She's showing me her ass.  She wants me to grind all up in that shit.  I oblige.\n\nFrom this point on, it's elementary.  I grind, tease, spin and eventually close.  I stop the kiss first and say, \"easy, you're moving really fast.\"  I throw shit in like, \"Wow.  You're aggressive.\"  She looks a little hurt.  \"I like that.  You're a girl who goes after what she wants.\"\n\nAt one point we're dancing and I look down into her massive cleavage.  I say, \"you know, I've got to be careful.  I could get lost down there.\"  She laughs.  I motorboat her.  She loves that shit.\n\nEventually, HB Drunk is outside puking.  So I get HB Stacked's number, receive a text from justdoitt who is one block away, and go wing him before calling it a night.\n\n**Close 7**","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

The two girls who did, I found more interesting than the others.\n\nA lot of girls tried asking me interview questions, but I usually just deflected and talked about other things.  The one question every girl asked was \"what do you do?\"  I got so tired of hearing that.  One girl I asked if she had every done something totally exciting and out of character for her, and she said \"moved to Japan for a year.\"  Another girl asked me to tell her about herself, so I told her I was a poor boy from a farm who grew up to be a famous rockstar named \"The Boss.\"  LOL.  She was loving it.  Another girl asked me what I do and I said, \"That's so boring.  Everyone asked that.  I feel like I want to lie.\"  She said, \"OK.\"  I told her I was a deep sea diver who searched for pearls.  One girl I called \"abrasive.\"  She was being a bitch, but after I called her out on it, she totally calmed down and was actually kind of sweet.\n\nI didn't number close and don't have any matches at this point in time.

I do now start striking up conversations with girls, but never really in a bar/club scene.   To be frank, I've barely been in a bar the last four weeks as I've stopped drinking.\n\nI was supposed to go out on a date tonight with an HB8.5.  The girl is 22 and extremely attractive.  The woman just oozes femininity and makes you feel like a man.  I've already had sex with her once, but knew nothing was in the bag. While I have dates set up with other girls this week, I have been thinking non-stop about this one.  Bad move, I was starting to come across from a place of neediness, even though I hadn't spoken to her since I set up the date.  I just felt that all of this was being broadcast subliminally to her via another dimension.\n\nSure enough, the girl texted me right before our date tonight and said she couldn't make it, but would want to meet up tomorrow maybe.  While I was initially devastated, I rubbed one out and then reflected.  It's just a girl, and there are plenty of other HB8s and above out there.  Don't put her on a pedestal.  And don't call her back.  She's probably gone now, probably gone out with some other guy tonight that displayed better value.\n\nI avowed to go out sarging alone tonight, something I've never done.  Unfortunately the timing's bad because it's Halloween and most bars require you to wear a costume, which I hadn't gotten because I thought I was going out with this girl tonight.

Normally I do a little bit of pickup elements here and there and not really consistent, but last night I felt like I had 3-4 elements down per interaction which worked really well.\n\nHere's what happened in brief: \n\n- Did the class1.5 kino on about 10 different sets (hand on her back)\n- Did the claw about 3 times\n- Went up to a bunch of girls on the dance floor, started dancing with them, twirling them around, and all of kind of dance moves, a bit of salsa too, and just spreading good value\n- Girls were submissive with my dominance, and low dominating tonality.\n- Tried disarming a huge cockblock who was preventing my wing and I from pulling girls. It kind of worked for a little bit, got her smiling and laughing, but damn a lot more work was needed and I didn't have the patience at 3AM.\n- Tried going sexual\n- Did disqualifiers - \"you and I are not going to get along\", \"we're getting a divorce\"\n- Did push/pull, worked like charm, I told a girl to \"Go away, leave, get out of here\" when she told me her name wasn't really \"ashley\", when I pushed her away, she came back with 10x the force and put her arm around me and was all over me. I danced with her and grinded with her in the middle of the street. Walked with her and friends all the way to her hotel.\n- Did cocky funny/teasing - girl asked me where I worked I said I flip burgers at mcdonalds, she asked me how much I made I said $1.99 an hour, she asked me how old I was I said 12. Everytime I didn't give her what she wanted, she wanted me more and more. She ended up qualifying herself like mad and I got her so invested into me.\n- Was dominant, within 10 seconds of speaking to a girl my arm was around her. Was straight away building sexual tension.\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

I wasn't going to drink but as soon as I got there everyone started chanting my name because they'd been doing shots of Tequila and it was down to the last bit still with the scorpion inside the bottle. Being the weak individual I am I drank the shot. My mate gave me a beer to wash it down with. That was all I drank all day though.

That said, I'm going to be more diligent in updating this file to keep myself honest.\n\n**Friday night, 12/16** - This was an awesome night.  My car's been broken down so my wing agreed to pick me up at my place and we headed out.  We went to a Christmas charity event in Dallas.  That was the highest concentration of hot women I've ever seen in one place; some minor celebrities were there as well.  Normally this would intimidate me, but I felt pretty awesome.  Blown out hard a few times, but kept pushing through.  We ended up bouncing to a few places in uptown once the charity event died down.  Through the night, I managed to rack up 5 phone numbers, which is a personal record!\n\n\n**Saturday night, 12/17** - Pub crawl in Fort Worth.  I spent a large portion of my night on the dance floor.  I was trying for a SNL with a cute Asian chick but logistics were not in my favor as she rode with her friends and I didn't have my car either.  Oh well, she is texting me as we speak.

{"body":"Some of them did, some of them didn't go beyond opening (hi, hello, good morning, etc)\n\nWhat I've noticed is: \n\n\n1) Older women in general LOVE to be opened. They are socially competent enough to continue a conversation beyond the opening and know how to talk. I suspect younger women aren't socially competent enough to talk or think that they're in danger. Like a reverse AA but for girls.\n\n\n2) Open men as well, opened an old man in line (I was the last then he came in and became the last person) who then bridged in another woman late 30's a tourist in my city (she became the last in the line).\n\n\n3) One of the first ones I did open was a total nerd who I would love to have a relationship with, but alas was taken. She works for the Federal Government hacking smart phones, pulled out my Blackberry and asked her about if she could open it. She did grab it, I was hoping that our hands would touch, but they didn't, I may have chickened out once I knew she was taken, so not going to steal her from someone! Morals and all... Oh I should mention that she was a bit hammered at the party but I opened nonetheless.\n\n\n4) Open everyone including guys! I can't stress this enough. I learned a lot of interesting things about cars and electrical wiring from them. In general it made me feel really good from the interaction and I think I saw some women who past by notice us talking and were interested in me. I demonstrated high social value (either me or the men I talked with)\n\n\nSo much more confident now to open anyone and everyone!

They stand in well-footed areas and say seemingly innocuous things like, \"Can I have a minute of your time to talk about charity?\" and \"Hello.\" Invariably I consider how good this sort of thing makes you at approaching anyone and if I didn't have another job I'd consider doing it just to get the skills it necessitates, along with the money. \n\nBut then I thought, \"Why don't I do the same thing?\" Just one day get a clipboard, put on some sort of official looking clothing, and ask for \"a minute\" of people's time. And then proceed just to talk to them. Maybe write their name down on the clipboard to track approaches and just clock approaches all day. Joke about the fact that I'm even doing it, but agree with people about how it's weird we walk by each other all day barely saying hello. \n\nBasically I need a way to trick myself into making a lot of approaches in one day and this is the best idea I've thought of yet.

{"body":"Today I went out to go to a freestyle rap show in Berkley and the first three people I saw on the street I said good afternoon to. I don't think any of them even acknowledged me, haha, but it's a good way to get into a social state and it reminded me that people aren't violently opposed to interacting with strangers the way my subconcious seems to think.\n\nI walk up to the line to get on BART, the subway system in San Francisco, and turn around and make eye contact with this guy, he sort of acknowledged me and I just say good morning. It's four fucking o'clock. I'm just laughing to myself on the inside and I walk onto the bart. \n\nAn attractive young professional type asian walks on sits behind me and I really want to talk to her but I remember that she was also in line and probably saw me say \"good morning\" and part of me says not to talk to her coz I've already blown it. Writing this down I see it's a dumb excuse, but it made sense at the time. A dude gets down and sits down in front of me and we make it over the bay to Oakland and I say I need to talk to someone so I just lean toward the guy and say \"We made it to Oakland!\" Totally silly, could make me look crazy or stupid but I don't care, doesn't matter he doesn't hear me and now I feel supper silly so I laugh it off. \n\nNow I think the girl behind me must really think I'm crazy, but some part thinks if she thinks I'm crazy I have nothing to lose, so I walk to check the route map and come back to sit down and see she's on her cell phone so I ask her \"How are your stocks going?\" She laughs and then asks what I mean and I tell her she looks like the type that's a financial high roller. There's some light banter, she's sort of enjoying but hasn't really hooked and I think I'm confusing her a bit, so I eject and turn around. Still, I had a conversation with a stranger, an attractive woman at that and it was positive. Just goes to show that the excuses your mind makes are usually bullshit. 1 down, 99 to go.\n\nHave to transfer trains, I think I said good afternoon to some more random people, can't exactly remember. I get on the train and sit down and a middle aged asian lady is sitting across from me reading a book so I ask her if it's any good. She turns to me and I see the cover and it looks like it's some sort of book of erotica, haha! She says it's good and \"very contemporary\" and we talk about books for a little bit. Good times. I get on my iphone and google the name of the book, turns out it isn't erotica, a little relieved and a little disappointed at the same time. 2 Down, 98 to go.\n\nWe get to another stop and I go up to check the map, and when I get back there's a middle aged black man sitting next to my seat. Old me would have either found a new seat for fear of human contact or sat down and put on my headphones and cranked them up but instead I sat down and made a joke about him stealing my row. He was a really cool guy and we actually had a great conversation about the bay area and life in general. A great reminder of how much better life can be if you're willing to reach out the people around you instead of just staying in your little bubble. Really wish I could remember his name, I was actually trying real hard to remember but sometime during the concert that afternoon I lost it. Anyways, 3 down, 97 to go, the challenge is already worth it.\n\nNow, this one doesn't count, but I get off at Berkeley and I'm walking down the street. There are SO many fine girls there! I'm trying to make eye contact with them all, and I see this beautiful asian girl, I'm going to say she's an 8.5 on my scale and I make eye contact and she just smiles and sort of looks down in a really cute way. I mean, it's some simple shit I know but honestly it's a great feeling to know that I just made this beautiful girl's day a little bit better and I get to feel like the man. Swag.\n\nSo the show is actually in an Adidas store and when I walk in I'm afraid it'll have already started because I'm half an hour late, but it really looks like there isn't a show there except for the fact that there's a turn table and some speakers in the back. Old me would have just stood around awkwardly, maybe even just peaced out, but I'm in social mode so I just walk up to some guy chillin in the back and ask if he's there for the cyper. Turns out he's a rapper named Fego, think his real name is Miguel, and we talk, I introduce myself to the people he's sitting down next to. Cool stuff, although I'm reminded I really know nothing about the Bay Area hip hop scene because they're dropping hella names I don't know. I guess I talked to 3 people here, but I'll count it as one set I guess. 4 down 96 to go.\n\nFego gets up and goes to talk to some other people and I sort of relapse into wallflower mode, but I just force myself up out of it and talk to like the first guy I see hanging out. Turns out he's a dude named Matt who actually runs a pretty big local hip hop blog, thizzler on the roof, and he's helping run the show. Cool stuff, good times, people come in to talk to him and I just introduce myself to them like a boss whereas old me would have just slinked back until I awkwardly ejected. This is shapping up to be the most comfortable I've ever felt rolling solo to a concert. And I'm meeting local internet celebrities, bonus! 5 down, 95 to go.\n\nDJ still hasn't shown up so I go out to chill with the people outside on the sidewalk. See a guy standing alone next to the door so I introduce myself, turns out he's a rapper named Dat who's hosting the event, cool. Small talk about the show, introduce myself to anyone who comes by to talk to him, more good times. Some dudes start rapping outside so I leave to check it out and from that point on most of the night is about the music rather than small talk. 6 down, 94 to go!\n\nAnyways, the shows great, had an awesome time, got dap from some real cool rappers and got a hug from one particularly bad ass dude, haha awsome! Show's over and I'm pretty worn out, see a really cute chick in front of me in the walgreens line but I choke and say to myself that I've already talked to enough people today. Excuses! Anyways, I get on the bart and it's crowded so a pretty decent looking girl actually sits next to me. Easy pickings right? My brain tries to make excuses but after a while I decide to go for it just to shut up my inner monologue so I see her luggage and ask if she's going on vacation. Turns out she's going home to Indiana, so we have a pretty good conversation about Indiana versus the Bay Area since I'm skeptical about how Indiana can measure up. Good times were had all around, 7 down, 93 to go.\n\nAt first I was skeptical about posting this because I sort of felt bad that it wasn't all about landing HBs and what not, but looking back at today I'm really glad I went for it and honestly I can say having conversations with just regular folks can be just as interesting if not more so than trying to grab the attention of a hot chick.","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

So I teased her about putting glue on her hand, and she laughed and challenged me to try it. I can't even do a V4 when I'm well-rested, so there was no chance of me getting it. I did some self-deprecation, tried it and failed, and then cracked more jokes.

{"body":"winter is pretty brutal for camping. first you need a nice sleeping bag. it also needs to be rated for the temperatures you'll be sleeping in. a 0 degree bag means that a male (we generate more heat than women), in long johns and a hat could possibly sleep comfortably in 0 degree weather. a down (down is very lightweight) 0 degree bag will set you back 150$ or so. It'll also only weigh between 1-2 pounds. Compare that to a synthetic which will run 5-6 lbs, or a coleman which would be around 12. \n\nI'd add a warm water bottle to your feet, and a tent will keep in quite a bit of heat as well. \n\nFor the day part it's not so bad. You don't really need a whole lot on to stay warm while hiking in 30 degree weather. Just make sure your baselayer is something that will dry out quickly, and layer up so that when you start sweating on an uphill you can take a layer or two off and dry out. \n\na small gas cooker would probably be worth it's weight in the winter -- you can start cooking in an instant, and you can also melt snow whenever you need to for water (a lot of the small creeks dry up around here in winter). \n\nthe gorge is still a nice camping/hiking spot in the winter. i'd recommend trekking poles in case the trails are muddy/snowy. \n\noutdoor stuff? i'm down :)","subreddit_id":"t5_2so6s","subreddit":"120EastOak"}

Es necesario un poco de altruismo en este mundo, algo m\u00e1s de humanidad y no s\u00f3lo que las cuentas salgan, olvidando que detr\u00e1s de esos n\u00fameros hay personas. \n\nLo gracioso es que ahora el gobierno nos quiera convencer que esta medida es coherente. No he o\u00eddo de sus bocas una m\u00ednima explicaci\u00f3n en algunas de las ruedas que hacen de cara al p\u00fablico (no ya en el congreso, que cuando es televizado no tiene nada que hacer con S\u00e1lvame o Gran Hermano) sobre en que consiste esta medida. Poca informaci\u00f3n y claro luego en televisi\u00f3n, en las manifestaciones del 15M que yo apoyo y seguir\u00e9 apoyando, salen en televisi\u00f3n entrevistadas personas que dicen que esta reforma no se puede hacer \"porque eh... mmm... no pueden... eh.... poner un techo de esto....e...gasto\". No me voy a dedicar a echarle la culpa a nadie. Probablemente esa mujer que no conozco que sali\u00f3 en televisi\u00f3n ser\u00eda la mayor responsable de su propia desinformaci\u00f3n. Pero, \u00bfalg\u00fan intento de informar al ciudadano por parte de los que s\u00ed deben hacerlo? Voy a confiar en que me estoy equivocando, en que s\u00ed han salido pol\u00edticos de la talla de Blanco o Rubalcaba explicando qu\u00e9 supone aplicarla y qu\u00e9 no, en cuyo caso, este \u00faltimo p\u00e1rrafo queda totalmente invalidado.\n\nLo que nunca voy a permitir es que nos quieran vender la moto de que lo coherentes que son. Si realmente esta medida es tan coherente, que lo hubiesen aplicado desde el principio de la democracia o al menos en alguno de los 7 a\u00f1os anteriores en los que ha gobernado el PSOE. Pero \u00bfahora? \u00bfjusto ahora? \u00bfy que encima quieren que nos creamos que es por inspiraci\u00f3n divina y no porque la mam\u00e1 Merkel se ha puesto seria? \n\nSe supone que a\u00fan queda el Senado, pero seamos realistas, van a conseguir lo que quieren, por mucho que digan que les hubiese gustado haber convocado un refer\u00e9ndum pero que no hay tiempo, su cinismo ha vuelto a salir victorioso. Y probablemente lo vuelva a hacer el 20N. As\u00ed que por su bien que no se equivoquen, que defiendan el estado de bienestar como tanto aseguran que lo van a hacer, \"voy a creerme sus palabras\". Pero a la m\u00ednima, el pueblo, el que de verdad tiene el poder como etimol\u00f3gicamente se supone que se lo confiere la palabra \"democracia\", saldr\u00e1 a la calle, saldremos a la calle, nos manifestaremos, gritaremos, dejaremos las cosas claras, ... pero eso si, sin violencia, por mucho que haya quien diga que nunca se han conseguido revoluciones sin violencia. Los que aseguran eso son mechas andantes, hay que tener cuidado por muy aliados que sean. El peligro, aunque pueda parecer parad\u00f3jico, no est\u00e1 tanto en los que nos gobiernan, como en nuestros vecinos. Porque de estallar algo no nos vamos a jugar el pellejo cara a cara con zapatero, ni con rajoy, ni con esperanza aguirre, ni con emilio bot\u00edn... los que empu\u00f1ar\u00edan armas ser\u00eda el propio pueblo, el pueblo contra el pueblo, el divide y vencer\u00e1s. \n\nTenemos que permanecer unidos. Unidos no pueden hacer nada, unidos ning\u00fan guard\u00edan podr\u00e1 decirle a ning\u00fan perro que ladre. Para conseguirlo tiene que entrar de una vez en la mente de nuestra sociedad que no existen las diferencias y no, no se es un extremo ecu\u00e1nime ni un profundo relativista moral por reconocer que hay una cosa b\u00e1sica que nos une a todos los seres humanos: **Vivir**. No voy explayarme innecesariamente en algo que ya entra m\u00e1s dentro de la filosof\u00eda que del tema que nos ocupa, simplemente lo que quiero dejar claro con eso del \"no hay diferencias\" es que todos somos la misma especie, que buscamos vivir en paz, vivir bien, huyendo del sufrimiento, como nuestra biolog\u00eda nos dicta, y que hoy d\u00eda tenemos los recursos para conseguirlo, para que a nadie le falte un sitio donde dormir, para que a nadie le falte comida, ni bebida... para poder ayudarnos los unos a los otros tanto f\u00edsica como psicol\u00f3gicamente y para tener acceso a la cultura \u00bfdemasiado \u00f1o\u00f1o? No estoy muy acostumbrado a decir estas cosas. No soy adem\u00e1s una persona especialmente religiosa, ni afectiva... pero son cosas que todos deseamos y que no nos atrevemos a decir, quiz\u00e1s porque no lo vemos posible... si hay diferencias.\n\nPD: Desde luego irse por los cerros de \u00dabeda tambi\u00e9n es un arte XD","subreddit_id":"t5_2sscg","subreddit":"15M"}
{"body":"Interesant\u00edsimas declaraciones de la autora del v\u00eddeo, creo que merecer\u00edan m\u00e1s difusi\u00f3n:\n\n\"Primero agradeceros a tod@s el apoyo, las cr\u00edticas y la difusi\u00f3n que le est\u00e1is dando al v\u00eddeo. Lo sub\u00ed con una calidad media para ense\u00f1\u00e1rselo t\u00edmidamente a algunos amigos por Facebook y la repercusi\u00f3n me ha asombrado mucho m\u00e1s de lo esperado.\n\nAhora viene el an\u00e1lisis personal del por qu\u00e9 hice el v\u00eddeo y que quiero transmitir con \u00e9l.\n\nHe visto como, tras los varios episodios de cargas policiales que han sufrido los manifestantes, empiezan a verse distintas actitudes entre miembros del movimiento. Unos abogan por una violencia que, en algunos casos, consideran necesaria para lograr cambios y otros siguen queriendo que el movimiento siga pac\u00edfico hasta el final.\n\nLa pregunta que a m\u00ed me surge es \u00bfQu\u00e9 cambios queremos lograr y cu\u00e1l es el fin del movimiento en s\u00ed? Yo tengo mi opini\u00f3n personal al respecto: creo que la lucha no es contra el poder sino contra la dormida consciencia humana que legitima ese poder (por eso he a\u00f1adido im\u00e1genes de injusticias a nivel global y las consecuencias \u00faltimas del capitalismo). Por lo tanto veo que si quiero \"conScienciar\" (Consciencia: Conocimiento inmediato que el sujeto tiene de s\u00ed mismo, de sus actos y reflexiones. Capacidad de los seres humanos de verse y reconocerse a s\u00ed mismos y de juzgar sobre esa visi\u00f3n y reconocimiento.) no lo lograr\u00e9 siendo violento ya que asustar\u00e9 a aquel que hubiera tenido inter\u00e9s en escucharme.\n\nCreo que el poder no teme que ocupemos el congreso ni que respondamos con violencia, lo que teme es que cada vez seamos m\u00e1s los que nos demos cuenta de sus mentiras y actuemos en consecuencia no entrando en su juego: no endeud\u00e1ndonos, no consumiendo cosas in\u00fatiles, no crey\u00e9ndonos sus discursos, no separ\u00e1ndonos, no qued\u00e1ndonos en casa...\n\nPara m\u00ed las cargas policiales, el enfrentar a cat\u00f3licos y laicos deliberadamente, llamarnos \"perroflautas\", \"antisistema\". \"radicales\", \"piojosos\", \"violentos\", las entrevistas manipuladas y la informaci\u00f3n sesgada de algunos medios, etc. son provocaciones.\n\nCuando utilizo el t\u00e9rmino perro/s no es porque yo piense que los que se defienden violentamente lo son. Es porque es lo que est\u00e1n deseando llamarnos, es porque est\u00e1n provocando que actuemos como tales para poder al fin llamarnos violentos y radicales con raz\u00f3n.\n\nHago la comparaci\u00f3n entre perros y seres humanos porque los perros no son conscientes de las consecuencias de sus actos. Si un perro apaleado por su amo supiera que al morderle, \u00e9ste tendr\u00eda la excusa perfecta para sacrificarlo, no lo har\u00eda. En vez de morder la mano de su amo morder\u00eda la cuerda que le mantiene preso.\n\nLos seres humanos somos inteligentes e imaginativos, pero tambi\u00e9n instintivos y pasionales. La \"moraleja\" del v\u00eddeo es que debemos ser capaces de pensar en otras formas de lucha para no recibir esos porrazos y al final no hartarnos de recibirlos sabiendo cu\u00e1les ser\u00edan las consecuencias. No pretendo que nos hagamos m\u00e1rtires, pretende que evolucionemos en la lucha y no tengan ni excusas para darnos.\n\nSe me ocurre no concentrarse en un sitio (total, los medios nunca dir\u00e1n la verdad sobre el n\u00famero de participantes) sino dispersarnos por todo el territorio c\u00f3mo se hizo en Madrid tras el cierre de la Puerta del Sol. Por ejemplo.\n\nLas im\u00e1genes de Londres y Grecia son ilustrativas. No hacen referencia a comparaciones sino a una situaci\u00f3n deseada por el poder. Podr\u00eda haber elegido cualquiera en el espacio/tiempo pero he preferido que fuesen im\u00e1genes cercanas.\n\nEl por qu\u00e9 de la elecci\u00f3n del tema: La canci\u00f3n de los Rage Against the Machine \"Killing in the Name\" habla sobre el racismo de las fuerzas del orden estadounidenses, pero por estos lares muchos de nosotros la hemos sentido c\u00f3mo un himno a la rebeld\u00eda y a la necesidad de responder violentamente ante la opresi\u00f3n. Es un icono. Pero al igual que hemos \"reinventado\" la forma de luchar una vez, la podemos reinventar de nuevo y darle un nuevo enfoque a este m\u00edtico tema.\n\nEllos dicen, entre otras cosas: \"Now you do what they told/taugh ya\" (Ahora haces lo que te dijeron/ense\u00f1aron) \"Now you're under control\" (Ahora est\u00e1s bajo control). Pues yo lo que he querido es cambiar el significado de eso que nos dicen y ense\u00f1an que tenemos que hacer. Ya no es: \"estate calladito o sino recibes\". Ha cambiado a: \"ven aqu\u00ed si tienes cojones y dame razones para darte m\u00e1s duro\".\n\nMe siento m\u00e1s poderosa (no es una errata, soy mujer) dej\u00e1ndoles con ganas de pegarme que tir\u00e1ndoles una piedra. Prefiero ver su impotencia que su miedo. Prefiero abandonarles que enfrentarme a ellos.\n\nEspero haber resuelto las dudas y no haber ofendido a nadie. Este es un v\u00eddeo que no pretende representar a nadie sino s\u00f3lo transmitir un enfoque personal y, en todo caso, abrir debate.\"","subreddit_id":"t5_2sscg","subreddit":"15M"}
{"body":"Basically, Spain is under a huge economic crisis, caused by neocon politics on a construction and mortgage economic bubble . Our social system also know as \"State of Welfare\" is in danger because governments punishes the middle and lower classes while benefit and provide advances to banks, corporations and markets. Our system, of course, is a capitalist system but some comunity services as the healthcare, education or infraestructures are promoted and/or provided by the state (payed by all contributors of course). Something similar to the new deal politics of Roosevelt, you know?. This system likes everybody, or at least to the greater part of the population. We see them as a \"good\" capitalism or at least the lesser \"evil\". However, we suffer a terrible bipartidism in politics by decades: the two most voted (PP &amp; PSOE) are different faces of a same coin. It's because our electoral and representative system have huge defaults. An example of this political show: the most radical neocon economics changes are made it now by a party who called himself PSOE... basically \"socialist worker spanish party\". It's a bad joke and people is really angry (in fact, I personally see politics on US very similar in the \"republican vs. democrats\" game). 15M is a movement that starts at may 15 (2011) and is basically a fight whose objective is get a real democracy: the people is against a system that reminds us the totalitarian times. So basically is a revolt like in Egypt but in a developed country. lol No, seriously, we have huge levels of unemployment and price of life is in constant rising.

Easily a half dozen great ideas there! \n\n/redditthorughhistory would be an easy one to do, will try that shortly. \n\n/classicfilms, I'll build up some recent film-related submissions first and then give them a try. \n\nThe hub for the 20th century is an excellent idea. I've been thinking about starting a 1930s thru 1950s based reddit too, so that would round it out for the most part. \n\nI like the roleplaying idea; I've tried to include 20s slang in the titles wherever I could fit it, so if I could seed the place with a bit more of that, should provide something of a foundation for the idea. And while the place is nearly vacant now, if there's some crossover with /redditthroughhistory, that would be a natural start for it. \n\nGmail alerts are awesome, aren't they?

Seems like they'd have an inherent interest in connecting with a lot of the historical reddits, if for no other reason than those affiliations will help them mine for new material. They've only been around for ~3 months, and already have 6,000+ subscribers, so that would be a good way to raise your visibility with a fairly active crowd.\n\nI'd check with one of their mods first, but [classicfilms](/r/classicfilms/) might also be a good fit, that being the beginning of the classic film era, and all.\n\nThe other thing you might try to do is organize a [hub](http://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/bkd0n/what_is_depthhub_what_does_it_do/) connecting all of the decade-oriented reddits. All such reddits that I've seen are concentrated in the 20th century, so you could call it /r/20thcenturyhub, or some such. Alternately: you seem to be the earliest, and you list your decade as \"the first modern decade,\" so maybe call it /r/ModernEraHub.\n\n&gt; ... or if it could work but is missing an ingredient.\n\nWell, I don't know if it would help or not, but one idea that sprang to mind is that you could basically run semi-regular role-playing threads. For example, I've noticed that some online news sources occasionally run period pieces, [like this one](http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2011/may/10/guardian190-napoleon-god-vote), for their historical interest. You could post those when they pop up, and encourage everyone to respond as though they were living in the '20s and not responding to something with the benefit of 90 years of retrospect. The trick would be to put an explanation in the sidebar, and use a title tag to indicate which submissions are supposed to elicit \"in-character\" responses. With gmail, there's a way to set \"alerts\" so that it'll notify you when stories about a particular topic crop up -- that might help you catch those stories when they appear.\n\nI don't know if that sort of thing matches your vision for the reddit, but it could be fun, and might keep more people around once they've seen the community.","subreddit_id":"t5_2s1dv","subreddit":"1920s"}

(Nothing against Hornswaggle's abilities, but I dare not predict the future; shit happens, as they say.)\n\nI would be honored to be involved in any attempt at publishing. To me, that would be fantastic.\n\nI am internally opposed about how best to publish this. On the one hand, it would be fantastically cool to have a popular flash-fiction, self-published book. However, it would be possible to reach a wider audience (and make more money, and improve odds in a future career in writing) by publishing traditionally. My current best plan would be to finish the story, self-publish through whatever means seems best, and then go to a big publisher with the internet popularity to get it published by them.\n\nHowever, I am not involved in the choice to publish, or how to do so; that is the business of Hornswaggle, I am merely the odd helpful internet troll, assisting this good man with his writing endeavor.\n\n**Edit:** It shouldn't be too difficult to get published, considering [this guy](http://27bslash6.com \"David Thorne's 27b/6\") got [his book published](http://www.27bslash6.com/tiiap.html).","subreddit_id":"t5_2sw5t","subreddit":"1985sweet1985"}

Every single particle in the 2011 universe would *have* to change due to his existence in the past. So really, he has no choice in whether he changes the future of people he knows and doesn't know. All he can change is whether he involves himself directly enough in their lives that their futures differ significantly from the ones he remembers.

{"body":"They ditched us. Rome and 1985 began as flash-fiction. Really spontaneous writing, expression for the sake of expressing; essentially, typing out loud.\n\nThen, it got popular, an audience was formed, and it took away some spontaneity, and it put pressure on the authors to have a plot and an ending, and opened them up to massive criticism. I am not saying this affected the authors per se (as I can't get inside their heads), but it would explain why the pace slowed down and the criticism and editor nazis popped up. It would definitely give pause to my writing.\n\nThen, it got way more popular, and book deals, and movie deals, and posters and icons and internet idolatry were thrown about. We're talking important people with grand plans of making it big. That's a far cry from the spontaneity of flash-fiction on some glorified message board.\n\nThey ditched us for the next, better thing that lies before them. I don't blame them, it's the next logical and economic progression of their work, after being so pressured. \n\nI, like some others, am simply saddened, because I became emotionally invested (and not how-can-I-turn-this-into-more-money-invested) in this story. And our Reddit culture is of open expression and commenting by Redditors; not closed, for-profit dealings with secret agents, keeping us all in the dark. \n\nBasically, we got ditched. And it is totally understandable. Reddit is super conducive to getting great ideas started, and then later appropriated. Reddit's recent growth means we're lurked by the Gawker network, Boingboing, lit agents, publicists, etc, etc, etc. and anything originating here on Reddit won't stay exclusively here for long.

I don't know if you've already planned out much of the plot but I have an idea that might add some conflict if you're interested\n\nIn 1983 after the KAL-700 flight was shot down, Reagan ordered the GPS system to be made available for civilian use *but* it didn't go into effect until the system was fully operational which, from my understanding, was 1993. So by 85 there were GPS satellites in orbit but they were still reserved for military use. I'm not sure if the GPS in the modern smartphone is backwards compatible with those older satellites but assuming it is, imagine if you had it turned on for just a moment. It communicates with one of those early military satellites and suddenly the US government is looking for the owner of an unknown device capable of requesting a signal from a brand new piece of defense hardware.\n\n\nedit: just saw the \"no ideas\" post, mea culpa :/ ","subreddit_id":"t5_2sw5t","subreddit":"1985sweet1985"}

Deception Point was pretty bad ass though so definitely check that one out.  With all that said, don't think any of those are free online!

Normally, I correct Redditors on their grammar in an entirely silly and over the top manner, including citations for simple fixes. In this case, I will be doing my best to clean up the writing how it is right now, without making any major changes. I plan, in the future, to complete more major changes, but that will come only with the intimate cooperation of Hornswaggle, to produce the best work possible.\n\nAs I said, I will continue to deliver edited versions as comments to Hornswaggle's posts. I originally did so as comment replies, which is probably why you didn't see them (so much volume of comments, and some people seemed to think I was karma-whoring or being a prick).\n\nAs validation, Hornswaggle has used my exact text when re-posting his previously written work to this subreddit.

But I've noticed this trap come up too many times with amateur authors to leave it unsaid:\n\n*You need to think hard about how this story is going to end and begin leading us there sooner rather than later*.\n\nDoes the protagonist return to the future? Does he die? Does all of time and space come to an end for some reason? Is there a POV switch from the \"back in time\" protagonist to the 2011 one (where the former would be an old man)? In any event, figure out how and why this story ends, and quick. Then begin foreshadowing it.\n\nAlso, I once read some great advice about writing fiction: if nothing interesting happens in five pages, have a man with a gun walk through the door. \n\nAgain, great installment. I'm just worried that it's beginning to stall a bit and it seems like it has a vague direction. For all I know you have the entire thing planned out, but in case you don't I'd suggest you establish a \"finish line\" soon: a goal to reach, an ending to accomplish.\n\nGood luck, and keep writing!","subreddit_id":"t5_2sw5t","subreddit":"1985sweet1985"}

And I believe the unedited version was actually better written. Good effort, though.\n\nAnd oh, fingerprints???? That's how I would check someone's story like that.\n\nAlso, from installment 4:\n\n\"As I stand I see my father looking at me. He has his hand on my 11 year-old shoulder. I look at him. He has more hair, and then it dawns on me. He was 27 when I was born.\"\n\nFrom 8:\n\n\"My father's bald head disappears into the car.\"\n\nThe end of this installment is confusing, also.

As a father, I would have no choice but to take this very seriously and approach it very carefully. There is other evidence, like the gadgets for example, that helps, but it is not yet 100% damning. Those gadgets could exist already for all he knows, just not available to the public.

{"body":"You know why this is so great? 2 reasons: \n\n1. Hornswaggle has a fantastic voice in his writing. The pacing is perfect and the style is cool and comfortable to read.\n\n2. Due to the nature of the question that is the topic of his story, Hornswaggle started his story in the midst of action. Unlike the traditional story map (Introduction, character development, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution), Hornswaggle has jumped straight into \"Rising Action\" and is filling in the character development as he goes. It is something that marks a great writer. Many try to do this and fail, but those who succeed are amongst the greatest. The easiest example I can think of is Charles Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol\" where the first line of the book is \"The Marleys were dead, to begin with.\" BAM straight into action. Hornswaggle has essentially done the same thing but has not fallen victim to the typical pitfalls of a budding writer attempting to \"start with a BANG;\" like sacrificing the depth of characters for the continuation of plot. \n\nIn short, Reddit has showcased a man with great talent. It is not honed, it is not polished or practiced- It is raw talent that can only get better with further writing. I encourage OP to take a few creative writing classes at his local technical college or better, (not because he \"isn't good enough\" but because with that kind of talent, he should be looking for every possible way to increase his chances of scoring with it) seek the counsil of a published author, and find a strict proofer/editor that will challenge him.","subreddit_id":"t5_2sw5t","subreddit":"1985sweet1985"}

{"body":"#Proofed by A_Grammar_Expert with permission from Hornswaggle\n\nMy father's bald head disappears into the car.  I see the car settle as he gets in and the I see his hand reach over and unlock the passenger door.\n\nManual locks.\n\nI move and open the door.  I lean over and look in.  He is looking at me.  He\u2019s... waiting.  He\u2019s waiting for me to get in.\n\n\u201cSo... where are we going?  I don\u2019t think it's too... inappropriate of me to ask.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t going far.\u201d  He continues to stare, then he shakes his head impatiently.  \u201cIt\u2019s broad daylight and we are going somewhere public and visible.\u201d\n\nI grin, \u201cThanks.\u201d  I stand up and let out a small sigh of relief.  \u201cI mean, I did wake up in the neighbor\u2019s bushes.  You\u2019ve got three kids to protect,\u201d  I say as I get in the car.\n\n\u201cListen\u2014\u201d he says.  He throws his right arm over the seat back to turn to me; I flinch.  \u201cI can\u2019t say that I don\u2019t recognize you.  When Josh said something this morning it crossed my mind that you looked like my son.  I didn\u2019t think anymore of it until Melissa called.\u201d  He looks me in the eye for a brief moment, he tilts his head from side to side.  He squints.\n\n\u201cBut we can\u2019t stay here to talk, can we?\u201d  he says, as he removes his arm to turn the ignition.\n\n\u201cI guess not. Mom says that Mark and his family will be back soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon't call her that.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m not sure what point in the process of believing the impossible you guys are at, but I know she\u2019s my mother, so... I\u2019ll do my best.\u201d  I don\u2019t think I can push my luck.\n\nWe drive around the corner, take another left and then another.  We haven\u2019t driven 50 yards before we turn into Tilles Park.\n\n\u201cThe Park?\u201d\n\n\u201cHas it changed much in 2011?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot really, they still do the Christmas lights but there is a nice modern jungle gym and water fountain somewhere over there where those swings are now.\u201d  I point.  He grunts in the general direction.\n\nWe drive down a slope and around a few curves and come to a rest in a two car parking spot in front of a picnic bench, in the high back part of the park.  We park and he gets out.  I get out, too.  I take my bag.\n\n\u201cSo, what is it you think you can get out my family?  Money\u2014do you need money?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that\u2014really.  Listen, I can tell you the whole story just like I told Mom\u2014er\u2014Melissa.\u201d\n\nWe are both moving towards the table instinctively, but he stops.  He puts his hand up and lowers his head, shaking it.  \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to hear all of that. How you came back from the future and what-not; Melissa and I took Josh and Megan to see *Back to the Future* just a few months ago.  I don\u2019t want to hear about some flux-capacitor bullshit and, frankly, it\u2019s just... just crap! What\u2019s the word?\"  He places his hand on his hip and searches the air for the word with the other, he begins to pace. \u201cYour mother is better with the words...\u201d\n\nI jump on that, \u201cMy mother?  I thought we weren\u2019t saying...\u201d\n\n\u201cHey, yeah, so you look just like my son, you got the same hair and the eyes and, yeah, she is nervous that she believes what you\u2019re saying, but I don\u2019t have that luxury, do I?  So what do you want?\u201d  He just looks at me.  He makes his hand into an open palm and holds it up as if to say, \u201cwhat the fuck else am I supposed to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cAdvice!\u201d  I blurt out.\n\nHe\u2019s non-plussed.  I realize that that is the truth.  \u201cAs far as I know, I am stuck here.  Here in a place I barely remember.  I guess it isn\u2019t so bad, I mean\u2014I survived it once as a 11 year old but not without help.\u201d\n\nI begin pacing.  \u201cI don\u2019t have anything and I\u2019m not talking about money or clothes or food.  I\u2019m talking about an identity, I don\u2019t have a valid 1985 driver\u2019s license.  I don\u2019t have basic things that allow a person to make their life in this world, you know?\u201d  I look at him and my arms are out like I\u2019m begging.  \u201cI don\u2019t have... an employment history...  to get a job with.  I have a Bachelor\u2019s Degree...  IN 1996!  There\u2019s no transcript of that.  As far as I know I am stuck here in 1985, not able to get back to 2011 with my girlfriend, and you and Mom in your sixties.  So, I thought the only people who might\u2014MIGHT\u2014believe me would be my parents!\u201d  \n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m not sure that I can do that,\u201d  he says, arms crossed.\n\n\u201cThen why did you bring me here?\u201d  I yell.  His eyes register a moment of concern.  \u201cIf you can\u2019t believe me, then why did you bring me specifically to this spot.  I know this spot, here in the park.\u201d  I am accusing him now.  My finger points past his shoulder towards the edge of the park, into some trees.\n\n\u201cRight there!  Right over there!\u201d  I stride past him pointing, shouting over my shoulder.  \n\n\u201cHere,\u201d  I stop and stand in front a group of three trees.  They are growing in what always looked like a perfect equilateral triangle.  They are 6 feet apart.  I turn to face him and point down in front of me looking right into his eyes.  \u201cThis is where we buried him.  He is right here, under three feet of earth, and we did it together and only you and I know about it.  It\u2019s still fresh in your mind because it happened, what... like two years ago now?\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s stopped right in his tracks, 5 feet in front of me.  This was the thing, the thing only I would know and he can\u2019t believe it.\n\n\u201cLook, I even keep it with me\u2014the tag. The dog tags, they're here in my messenger bag.\u201d I frantically whip around my bag. \u201cI keep it in a velcro pocket with a few odds and ends.\u201d I am opening flaps and zippers and I rip open a velcro pocket. Did they have velcro yet? Sure they did...? I reach in and bring out a simple nickel key ring, the kind that doubles back on itself. It has two dog identification tags on it.\n\n\u201cAfter Midnight was put down, you and I buried him right here.  Then Mallory wanted a new dog, so you guys got\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDoug...\u201d he whispers, astonished.\n\n\u201cYeah...\u201d  I look down at the key ring and take two steps forward to hold up the two tags in front of his face.\n\n     ,----------------------+\n    /    \u2013\u201cMidnight\u201d\u2013       |\n    \\  Owner: Rick Carlisle |\n     `----------------------+\n     ,----------------------+\n    /      \u2013\u201cDoug\u201d\u2013         |\n    \\  Owner: Josh Carlisle |\n     `----------------------+\n\n\u201c\u2014Doug... he died in 1997.\u201d\n\nMy father takes the ring and looks down at it.

I am happily married with kids i love dearly.\nAny such day dream fantasy gets bogged down into a convoluted mess of 'how can i wrangle things so that despite all these changes i end up with the exact same wife and kids i have now...'\n\nFor us to be the same people who got together I'd prolly have to wait until the same time in our lives to meet...

At the very least, the writing of a story can always be improved without altering the storytelling greatly, whereas improving the storytelling (flow, plot; really everything) requires not simply rewriting the text, but completely rethinking the entire thing.

{"body":"~~Edited~~ Proofed by A_Grammar_Expert\n\nA note from the editor:\n\n&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I see that you have used my slightly edited versions when re-posting them here. This heartens my soul, as it validates my efforts despite the sometimes negative reaction from Redditors in the original thread. I do not begrudge your lack of direct response; you must be well and truly swamped by other people's feedback. I will continue posting my edited versions as replies to your posts, so that they may be organized somewhat and easy for you to find. If you wish, I suppose it would be possible to make me a moderator in this subreddit, with a corresponding tag (\"Editor\", perhaps), to allow me to directly edit your posts, but I do not think that any convenience provided is worth the potential for mis-communication and other unpleasantness.\n\n&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;As well as my minor, mostly typo editing here, I plan on another set of more substantially modified versions. These will include mostly minor changes to things like the order of words and other intra-sentence structural changes. In some places, I noted where more substantial changes might be necessary; nothing which would change the meaning or style of the work, only to make it easier to understand. This might include breaking up, combining, and re-ordering some sentences. I have not yet made up my mind as to how I want to treat your constant changes in tense. Currently, my best argument is to make them intentionally chaotic in the beginning and gradually even them out as the story progresses and the main character becomes more accustomed to what he thinks of as the past actually being his present.\n\n&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;As always, my highest regards and most heartfelt encouragement.\n\n&gt; Sincerely,\n\n&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A_Grammar_Expert\n\n&gt; P.S. What kind of bullshit name is \"Bassmens\"? ;)\n\n# \n\nMy mother is on the phone, in the other room.  She has grabbed the big plastic handset we all recognize as obsolete, taken the 12 feet of pig tail cord with her, and disappeared into the dining room.  I am left with my thoughts and my pounding heart.  My hands are sweaty.  I look down at them and see that there are marks left by my fingernails.  My glasses are blurry; I reach into my back pocket.  Inside is a microfiber cloth for cleaning glasses.  This fabric doesn't even exist, probably.  As I clean my glasses I think about how I am just so unsure about everything.  I remember so much from my childhood, but when did that all happen?  If I tell my parents things I recall, have they even happened yet?  Events from when I was 12 blur together with events from when I was 8.  I even joke with friends that all my stories from childhood seem to have happened when I was 8.  The dichotomy is palpable; being from the future but feeling lost in a time when I should be able to predict events.  \n\nMy mother raises her voice, but I cannot hear what she is saying. It would be wrong to eavesdrop and most likely not a wise PR move with a young woman with whom I hope to establish a form of trust over an impossible scenario.  I begin to gather my things.  I notice among them a copy of Heinlein's *Stranger in a Strange Land* and I chuckle to myself.  I am returning items to my wallet when my mother returns from the dining room.  She hangs up the phone.\n\n\"My husband is on his way over right now.  I would like you to go out front so I can lock up the house.  The homeowners, the Bassmens, will be returning in a few hours.\"\n\n\"What did he say?\"\n\n\"He asked if you had a green argyle zip-up sweater and an over-sized purse.  Evidently, you've been to our house.\"\n\n\"I have, yes.  It didn't quite go as planned.  I didn't really have a plan.  How do you plan for this?\"\n\nShe is calm, but suddenly she looks tired.  She looks at the floor and then to the keys in her hands.  She keeps looking down.\n\n\"I guess you don't... As ridiculous as the whole thing sounds, as it is\u2014ridiculous\u2014we aren't going to have you arrested.\"\n\n\"That's thoughtful.\"  We both stand there.  I don't know why we are both so nervous.  Maybe I do, considering the circumstances, but the feeling, the air between us is so laden that it is impossible to know what to feel or think.  \"You have nothing more to ask me?\"\n\n\"No... not now, at least.  I prefer to hear what Bill thinks.  He definitely wants a word with you either way.\"\n\n\"Ever the skeptic.\" She catches herself snickering in agreement then peers up at me from her lowered brow.  Her smirk vanishes.\n\n\"I'll wait out front by the tree growing around the bricks,\" I offer.\n\n\"Don't try too hard or we'll think you're over-doing it.\"\n\nI walk out the front door past the tree growing over the bricks used to fill up a hole decades ago.  I look at my mother's car, a green Chevy Caprice Classic station wagon with fake wood panel decals.  Wow.  This old beater has been gone for years and years.  We drove this thing to South Dakota, Florida, Philadelphia, and even Connecticut.  My dad and I lined the back with tarps and filled it with firewood and mulch so many, many times.  Later, I drove it to high school for two years.  I drove high school friends around in it.  I would almost lose my virginity in it in 9 years... almost.  I touch it, run my hands up the hood and start to look inside.  I hear a car coming down the street and I look up to see my dad's green Datsun hatchback.  I would total that very same car when I was 17.  My girlfriend lived 40 minutes away and she gave me my first head on weekend nights as I drove her back home.  Shit, that girl is 9 right now.\n\nHe pulls up and parks behind my mom's car and I take a step back.  He shuts it down and gets out.  My mother is locking the door.  I take a step forward as he closes the door and he turns to look at me.  He's... guarded.  My father is a genial and fun-loving man.  All of my friends, for years, have loved my father.  He loves people, animals, and kids, especially kids.  He is, however, an immovable object of bald silence.  He is not easily swayed.  \n\nI stop and nervously grab my shoulders strap, I try to look confident but nonthreatening.  I have no idea if I am succeeding.\n\nMy mother walks over.  \"Hello Dear, did you leave Josh in charge?\"\n\n\"Yes, but he expects you to be right home.\"\n\n\"I would think so.\" She turns to me.  \"You sir, I hope to see you soon.\"  She looks over her shoulder at my father.  \"Back at the house perhaps.\"  She says with finality, this was clearly her preferred choice of the non-negotiable options she gave my father.\n\nShe gets in her car, turns the ignition, and buckles her safety belt.  She waves at me and smiles.  I wave back absentmindedly.\n\nShe pulls away.\n\nIt is around 2pm on Saturday 9/21/1985.\n\n\"Shall we go for a drive?\" my father suggests politely.\n\nI move towards the passenger side and stop in front of the car.  \n\n\"Where are we going?\" I ask, remembering the tenuous nature of my situation.\n\n\"Not far,\"  he says as he opens the door to get in the car.","subreddit_id":"t5_2sw5t","subreddit":"1985sweet1985"}

{"body":"#Proofed by A_Grammar_Expert with permission from Hornswaggle\u2014-\u2014I see no comments pointing out grammar fixes; what has happened, my fellow grammarians? I make extensive use of the correction comments, to double-check my own work as well as to make it easier. Perhaps it is best for organization if people respond to my post with corrections? Should I pursue this question with the rest of the community?\n\n\n\"Yes!\" I throw my arms up in a *V*. A smile creeps across my face.\n\n\"Josh!\" my father says. His face lights up, into an expression I've known for years.\n\n\"Yes! Thank God, yes!\" I grasp his shoulders.\n\n\"This is... this is amazing!\" He grabs my upper arms and pulls me in for a huge hug. I hug him back. I feel like the 11 year-old boy I'm supposed to be. For a brief second, I close my eyes. I feel a wave of relief flow over me. The burden of maybe having to rebuild my life alone is lifted off my shoulders as my father hugs me. We are the same age, but he my father and he can still make me feel like everything is all right.\n\nHe grabs my shoulders and we pull apart. He looks at me and puts his hand on my face. \"You look good.\"\n\nI laugh; he says it like we are old high school buddies and he hasn't seen me in 10 years. \"You look good too, Pop.\"\n\nHe puts his arm around me as we start walking to the car. \"'Pop'? You don't call me 'Pop'?\"\n\n\"Yeah... I think I started calling you 'Pop' about five or six years ago.\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\nWe are walking arm over arm back to the car, like old friends. \"I don't know. It's going to sound funny. I was in my early thirties and you were in your late fifties\u2014\"\n\n\"I make it that far, eh\"\n\n\"Sure, Pop.\" I stop and pull back a bit, my hand still on his back. \"You're still alive when I left.\" I look at him and remember the 64 year-old man from 2011. That man's face briefly replaces this one and I am all too aware of how much he is going to age. My sisters and I have just recently started talking about how frustrated he is, that his body just isn't capable of what it used to be.\n\nMy father was always an active guy, always working with his hands. He stayed fit by working in the yard, raking leaves, chopping wood, working around the house\u2014all with my help throughout the years.\n\n\"Still going.\" I say. We walk over to the hood of the car to sit. \"I was living in Chicago, have since 1999. In 2006 or so, you drove to Dayton, Ohio and I flew in. We went to an air show, which we hadn't done in a long time. There were something like 100 restored and maintained P-51s and you just had to see that. You called me up and said you were going and if I wanted to join you, here were the dates and the times. I knew you would really like it if I went, so I did. It was likes old times, just we were both older. I was a man, with a job and bills... I, uh... I had always referred old men as Pop. I looked at you on the tarmac and the word came to mind. It felt affectionate and appropriate.\" I shrug, \"It stuck.\"\n\nI turn to him\u2014I had been looking at the park. He is standing there, tearing up. \"So... we still have a good relationship?\"\n\nNow I start to tear up. We hug again. \"Shit, Pop. We've always had a great relationship.\" He hugs in 1985 just like the last time I visited St. Louis that summer in 2011. We've always loved each other very much. No amount of teen crap or rebellious nonsense got in the way of that. Granted, I wasn't very rebellious.\n\nWe separate. We just stand there looking at each other; it becomes goofy. He laughs, slaps his hand on my shoulder, and starts to sit on the car. He pats the other side of the hood. \"So, what the hell do we do now?\"\n\n\"Damned if I know. I have no idea what brought me here, how long I can stay or am supposed to stay or even if I'm supposed to go back, or if I can even get back at all. It's a little like *Quantum Leap*.\"\n\n\"Like what?\" he asks, puzzled.\n\n\"*Quantum Leap*, the show with Scott Bakula; he leaps from body to body righting wrongs and\u2014is that not on TV yet?\"\n\n\"No, I think if you remembered it we'd be watching it now, and I've never seen anything like that.\"\n\nI look forward. \"Maybe it hasn't come out yet.\"\n\n\"Maybe you could write it.\" I look at him; that isn't a bad idea.\n\n\"That's not a bad idea.\"\n\n\"What was it about?\"\n\n\"Well, this scientist gets sucked into some sort of nuclear experiment, thus \"Quantum\". He leaps around time and inhabits people's bodies. He has an assistant from the future\u2014from his time\u2014who appears with information throughout the episode to help him figure out what to do. The premise is that he is supposed to \"put right what once went wrong\". I say that in the patois of the show's opening, I remember it so well. I could have sworn that was around 1985.\n\n\"So the hero takes people over and changes their lives? Sounds like *Invasion of the Body Snatchers*.\"\n\n\"Both good movies.\"\n\nHe turns to me with a quizzical look. \"How have you seen them?\"\n\n\"Easily. You guys have a VCR by now, right?\"\n\n\"Yeah... Oh yeah! You saw it on tape.\"\n\n\"Nope, I saw it over Netflix. By 2011 I have a gaming system in my home that wires into something called the Internet which is a vast system of massive hard drives. I can have just about any movie ever made streamed\u2014electronically sent through wires\u2014directly into my house to a huge 46-inch TV.\" I look at him matter-of-factly. He seems unfazed.\n\n\"No shit?\"\n\n\"Let me show you this.\" I reach into my bag to get my phone. \"This is a smartphone, which is a mobile wireless telephone that also can interact with the Internet without any wires at all. Most everyone in 2011, even poor inner city high school kids, has some version of this. If not a smartphone, then a mobile telephone that doesn't need wires.\"\n\nI power up the phone and we slide right next to each other. I show him the different apps. Angry Birds, again. He is amazed.\n\n\"You have a map in here?\"\n\n\"Yeah, a map of the entire world, down to the street. Except North Korea. It won't work nown though\u2014there's no internet.\"\n\n\"It has a map right here, it says 'Niles, Illinois'. Evidently we are on Lehigh and Howard... wait it's gone. It says no signal.\"\n\n\"Yeah, you need the Internet and something called the Global Positioning System. It has to do with satellites all over our orbit.\"\n\n\"Wow.\"\n\n\"Yeah. Here...\" I take it from him. \"Let me take your picture. This aperture here is a still camera and a video camera.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"Yeah, Hold Still.\" I take his photo. \"I took Mom's picture at the Bassmen's. I knew she would geek out on the phone, being such a sci-fi buff and all...\"\n\n\"Your Mother! We gotta get back to the... 'Geek out', what does that mean?'\n\n\"It's hard to explain... Here's the photo I took.\" I show him the photo gallery, first his photo and then I slide my finger across the glass. When my Mother's photo appears, he is amazed.\n\n\"Did you just move the picture with your finger?\" He takes the photo from me.\n\n\"Yup. That glass reacts to my touch, I've been doing it this whole time.\"\n\nHe slides my mother's photo back to his. \"Amazing.\" He then slides back to my Mom and then past it. \"Who are these adorable kids?\"\n\nOh God.\n\n\"Um.. those are your grandkids.\" He looks up at me with the most gentle look on his face. I don't know what to do. Telling him about future gadgets is one thing, but years of TV and books have instilled in me an ungrounded fear of what knowledge of future personal events can potentially do. He keeps scrolling.\n\n\"These are your kids?\" He looks up.\n\n\"No, actually. Those are Megan and Mallory's kids. I don't know if you should look at that.\" He doesn't look up.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Well, that's 22 years in the future and... God knows what happens if you know these kids exist in 2011.\" I quickly take the phone back and push the button to power it down.\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" He's not pleased, he's looking at the phone.\n\n\"Dad, those kids... they mean the world to me\u2014and you\u2014in 2011, but they were born because of the sequence of events that led the girls to get married and have kids when they did and with the men they loved...\"\n\n\"So what does that have to do with me looking at pictures of them?\"\n\n\"I don't know, but it could... I honestly don't know what, but doesn't it make some rational sense?\"\n\n\"Rational sense? You've shown me my grandkids! Are they destined to come along?\"\n\nOh boy. My head is swimming with half-remembered episodes of Star Trek. Questions of causality and destiny. I was never a believer in destiny.\n\nI hang my head. \"I've been selfish. So selfish, and I've just now realized it.\"\n\nHe places his hand on my shoulder, \"What do you mean?\"\n\nI place my fingers on my forehead, thumbs on my cheeks, elbows on my knees. \"I've been so focused on getting some help, on not being alone in this mess, that I've not considered the consequences. I didn't think the world would suffer any real consequences, especially not me. My life in 2011 is good, but I haven't thought I'd really be going back and the thought of being able to lead a life again, of starting over, in a way, from 1985 at 37 and... and maybe helping you and Mom to raise 11-year old me to be, I don't know... better. but I was so focused, so selfish that I didn't think that 2011 Megan and Mallory didn't want their lives altered. They are happily married with beautiful little kids, they are building lives they love...\"\n\n\"And maybe you've changed all that?\" He states, with understanding I can tell he doesn't fully possess.\n\nI look up. \"Yeah...\"\n\nHe takes a deep breath and slaps me on the shoulder. \"This sounds like a conversation your mother should be involved in.\"","subreddit_id":"t5_2sw5t","subreddit":"1985sweet1985"}

{"body":"#Proofed by A_Grammar_Expert with permission from Hornswaggle\n\nMadonna and Sean Penn.  Yeah\u2014that\u2019s going to last a long time.  I am still trying to figure out if Madonna is or ever was hot.  The week old PEOPLE magazine the desk clerk loaned me is not helping.  If I didn\u2019t think she was hot when I was a hormonal teenager when she did that entire movie about fucking, then I\u2019m never going to.  Especially in 2011, I think to myself.\n\nI take another bite of Trix.  Why did General Mills change all their cereal formulas?  Trix in 1985 *are* better than in 2011.  I always wondered if it was just the mental distance between 2011 and my childhood that made them taste so crappy, but it wasn\u2019t.\n\n*slurp*\n\nYes.  Much better in 1985.  Two weeks later, PEOPLE has a gripping piece on parents and rock and the harmful effects it has on their impressionable young kids.  The crap still happens in 2011, except now with video games. The parents have gotten worse, too.\n\nIt is Sunday, September 29th, 1985 and I am eating a quick breakfast in a hotel room I have been living in for close to a week now.  The Bears are going to win today.   The room is pretty typical and it dawned on me how hotels haven\u2019t changed much in 26 years, except for the furnishings, which themselves really haven\u2019t changed much either.  Same too-firm beds.  Same unoffensive furniture.  The TV is much older.  I was able to do laundry yesterday and I now have 5 days worth of clean clothes, freshly purchased from the Famous-Barr down off of 270, in the old mall with the Dove on the pole.  I never knew why they had that dove there; it\u2019s long gone by 2011 and the whole place is a new Mecca for buying shit.  I\u2019m a 37 year-old from 2011 back in 1985.  My 11 year-old self is headed to school tomorrow and went all last week while I sat here in this hotel room in Brentwood.  I walked over to the McDonalds we went to all the time after games and swimming meets.  I walked over the old Schnucks that is now a Syms.  Or was\u2014I think it finally morphed into a Home Depot or Kohls or something.  There is a railroad restaurant, something all Schnucks used to have.  Regardless, I can\u2019t remember how many times I walked through that store with my mom.  I had a coloring book where you just use a paint brush and water to make \"paint\" out of little color dots on the paper.  I\u2019ve regressed further back than just 11.\n\nI moved to Chicago in 1999 and when I would come home 2 or 3 times a year, I noticed little changes here and there.  Nothing perpares you for 26 years of changes.  Brentwood Village is a strip mall that used to have a barber shop, a Ben Franklin's and a Kroger.  O.B. Clarke\u2019s, a family favorite bar for decades is still in it\u2019s original location, next to the barber shop.  Now, Brentwood Village is a huge corporate retail center with a REI and a Barnes &amp; Noble.  And, of course, the ubiquitous Starbucks.\n\nI should start Starbucks.\n\nI plan on walking down to the Ben Franklin\u2019s this week and seeing what\u2019s going on.  Is that Baskin Robbins still there, or there yet?  Is that convenience store with the stand-up Mario Bros. where I remember it?  I did my first shop lifting in the Ben Franklin\u2019s.  I almost got caught and it lost its appeal.  Walking down those aisles again... that will be weird.\n\n***Knock knock***\n\nI look up at the door, as if it will open itself; I\u2019m not expecting anybody.  I put my spoon down and open the door.\n\n\"Hi, Mom,\"  I say as I hold the door open.\n\n\"Good morning Joshua.\"  She breezes into the room.\n\n\"Hello, Josh.\"\n\n\"Hi, Pop.\"  We hug.\n\n\"Bears going to win today?\"\n\n\"Yes.  I told you.  Then win every game except one against the Dolphins.  They blank two teams in the playoffs before beating the Patriots for the Super Bowl.\"\n\n\"Ok, just wanted to check.\"  He rubs his hands together.  I can\u2019t tell if he is happy for the Bears or expects a few bucks from a bet he made.  Probably both.\n\n\"Can I offer either of you a cup of coffee?\"  I ask as I move to get my own second cup.\n\n\"No, we fed the kids and left them with Mom.\"  My mother holds a bundle of papers and grins as she looks down at the table.  \"More Trix I see.\"\n\n\"Yeah, they are just like I remember.\"\n\n\"What is this, a coloring book?\"\n\n\"Yeah, there is some serious lack of adulthood happening in this room.\"\n\n\"I can see.\"  She is amused.  They both sit.\n\nWe have been splitting the costs of this room, but that will have to change.  They can\u2019t afford to help for long and I am running out of money fast.\n\n\"Of course, that has to change,\"  I add.  I better say it before she does.\n\n\"Well, that is why we are here.\"  Which is also a lie.  One of them has been by every day this week to talk.  It has been fantastic.  But, they both take different tacks.  Mom is pragmatic about it, we were always intellectually compatible.  She hides her interest in the future.  Dad is different\u2014he has completely embraced me as a peer and even a friend.  He isn\u2019t shy about his interest in everything that happens over the next 26 years.   Both attitudes bother me.  Mom seems to be holding herself back and Dad needs to.\n\nMy mother always surprises me.  I guess that is what moms are supposed to do.  Some people would disagree and say that moms are supposed to be kind and predictable, comforting.  All that is true, but life is rarely those things all rolled into one and moms should prepare you.  They had to balance pragmatism and emotion raising you and they should keep that balance up.  She broke down crying the first night she came to visit the hotel after I moved in.  She had spent two nights wondering if she was crazy.  She was crazy for believing me, even though she could clearly see it in my eyes from the first moment I revealed the truth to her.  Once she decided it wasn\u2019t crazy to believe, it was crazy to even doubt in the first place when it felt true whenever she looked at me.  It took my 11 year-old self to coming into the dining room late one night to convince her to just live with the issue.  She revealed this much to me three nights ago and I said that I felt the same way.  Even though it feels like the most real thing that has ever happened, I know, in my mind, that this all should not be real.  We were quiet for awhile after that and then she asked me if I got married.  It was then that I had to tell her that I had been struggling hard with my thoughts about my girlfriend.  I had, I have, a great girlfriend in 2011.  We live together building a relationship after both of us had avoided serious ones for years.  As far as I know, she came home a week ago and I wasn\u2019t there.  No texts or calls and I never came home.  She woke up alone and went to work and didn\u2019t hear from me all the next day.  She\u2019d be worried\u2014was I hurt?  Did I just up and abandon her?   It hurts, it really hurts to think about her in 2011 wondering where I am.  It hurts to know that all I had hoped for that relationship is gone.  Somehow, Mom and I have been good since then, but she still pretends this is all business.\n\n\"So what leads do we have?\"  I ask.\n\n\"So, you\u2019ve decided to stay?\"  Dad says.\n\n\"Not so fast, Bob.\"  She interrupts him.  \"We need to worry about so much more before he decides that.  She grabs a newspaper and points to a red circle on a folded page.  \"What about this?\"\n\nI grab the paper, slide it across the table and spin it to read it.\n\n\u201cROGERS\u2019 PRODUCE\u2014HELP WANTED\u201d","subreddit_id":"t5_2sw5t","subreddit":"1985sweet1985"}

My phone also has a nice feature to just upload straight to youtube, which will help for these.\n\nI guess I'm scared to be a part of the world, I'm afraid people won't like me, for whatever stupid reasons.

I realize, everyone is different, everyone is awesome, and fuck the people who might not like me. :)\n\nSo yeah, in the future I'll be uploading updates to YouTube, not every day, but some days, and I'll maybe even do them on the road.

First of all, I don't like cheese that much, so she wasn't going to use much, and I've never really had lasagna for this reason.

I don't know if I'll ever change, but I do know that even if I never like certain foods, being able to tolerate them will make a **huge** difference when it comes to my social life. Can you imagine someone serving a salad and I get up and run away at a fancy meal or something. Anyways, we didn't eat it, because of me, so I feel pretty bad.

{"body":"In high school, I started a company that built personal computers for people I knew, because it was far cheaper to build one, than to buy one from say Compaq. Toward the end of high school, I was actually looking to make it official, and stop taking money under the table, but I never quite finished, and instead let the 'company' die out, for a few reasons.\n\nI also started a job working at a youth center, specifically in the computer room, managing about 10 machines, but more imporantly, dozens of children. The majority of these children came from poor backgrounds, with parents who had to work and could not pick them up from school, and I will never forget them. I remember the first day I arrived, they hated me, they hated my rules, and that I was actually paying attention and getting involved with their time on the computers. By the end of the year working there, they were crying and upset that I had to go, it was probably the best feeling of accomplishment that I can recall. I also finished my Eagle Scout in high school, but don't ask me how to tie a knot.\n\nDuring high school, I taught myself how to program in PHP, and I pushed myself to create more interesting and functional web creations, which eventually lead me to starting a company with a friend. He was great at finding clients, and making work for us, and had an idea of how coding worked, but I did the majority of the work in that regard. I worked on websites for companies like Nickelodeon and Vans, as well as the Pussy Cat Dolls and Ivysport. This was all happening in college at UCI, where I was doing quite well in my core classes. After several meetings, on how to take the company further, an opportunity arose to develop the company into something else, which I believe is worth quite a bit today.\n\nThat was the point which I got severely depressed, and ended up dropping out of school, and losing contact with my friend and that company. He tried to help me, but eventually gave up. I didn't know why I was there, what I was doing, or if I could handle any of it.\n\nFlash forward a few years, and I've just been doing odd computer jobs for people I know, or that my family knew. I've set up new computers, helped people transition to up to date accounting software (quickbooks anyone?), and just been sort of that all-around computer guy. If they had a problem, they would call me, and I would fix it.\n\nI don't have the specific qualifications, or certifications to get a job repairing computers, nor do I specifically want to. I want to be more involved with people. Recently I was helping a neighbor with their computer, and I realized there is probably a huge market for a computer specialist who could come in your home, and teach you how to clean up, and operate your computer so that it suits *your* specific needs, rather than the cookie cutter ones that get spit at you from Dell.\n\nDuring the past few years, I also spent a great deal of time on World of Warcraft, but I didn't just play the game, I helped create guilds and communities that were quite successful to say the least. I know it may sound silly, but the skills I learned from my time there, will be invaluable when applied to the real world. You are talking about preparation, organization, leadership, recruitment, discipline, friendship, and communication skills that I did not have when I started. In the final year of me playing, I created a community, that I will be proud of for the rest of my life, with over 70 active people, setting records, and being a leader like I hope to be some day.\n\nThat is the majority of my history, there isn't much more to it than that, unless you think I am leaving something out?","subreddit_id":"t5_2sd0e","subreddit":"1fear1day"}

I know from experience that when I was at my worst with my self-esteem and depression, I would force EVERYONE away and just hide, when really I needed help the most. Fortunately I found my way out, with a bit of help, but mostly through logic and talking out loud.\n\nI think they are both too ashamed as well as scared/confused about everything which doesn't help either.\n\nOh and did I mention I have a big problem with perfection? :P It's hard for me to deal with things some times, but I try my best.\n\nIn my journey to figure out things don't have to be perfect, it is hard to accept at times. When people put things in silly places, fold things silly ways, or hand you products that are not just right, I literally have to stop and tell myself it's okay. I remember one time in boy scouts, we would sell pizza every year at this city market type thing, and I loved being the guy who handled the money, because everyone else was so fucking slow. I remember doing it for hours on end because I would get upset when idiots would start miscounting money, or take minutes to hand people their change. It's SIMPLE MATH!!\n\nAlas, in the end, it's okay they weren't perfect, then again, there should be standards.\n\nI feel pretty shitty about not posting every day, though, it has really helped me understand my anxiety a lot better. As I was neglecting to post, I noticed this anxiety building in me for days, and it is the same anxiety that I forced myself into for years. I sabotage things that I enter into, for fear of being successful, because that will lead to greater failures. I guess I see this as being a great success, so my inner-me really paniced and tried to stop this.\n\nWhen I find my job and save up a few dollars to go see a doctor, I'm definitely going to ask about anxiety and anxiety medication, to see if there's something that can help. Then again, I'm fully aware of how powerful and dangerous mind-altering medications are (when I was depressed I took some for a while, didn't like how I felt, stopped abruptly, and almost immediately had an overwhelming urge to kill myself. Talk about ridiculous.).\n\nAnyways, gonna head to sleep, and it appears I just wrote another wall of text, so enjoy the wasted time. ;)","subreddit_id":"t5_2sd0e","subreddit":"1fear1day"}

Then he proceeds to tell them that Nostradamus was right about predicted the 3 antichrists, and names Napolean, Hitler, and another yet to come. How can you claim that when it hasn't happened!!!\r\n\r\nI did find the CIA usage of Bruce Bueno de Mesquita and game theory interesting. I'm not sure how you can validate predictions when they aren't publicly known or timestamped when they were made.

Last week starter trent steelman went down with looked like a injury that would side line him for a few weeks but he surprised everyone by being fully healthy and starting aganist Big ten up in comer Northwestern. \"I did not think he was even going to be able to play but that shows you what type of man and player that he is,\" said head couch Atherton. I cought up with Max jenkins Senior back Qb and he said \"i was ready to start but when trent was able to go i took a backseat. I was ready to play and lead my team but im glad trent was able to come back so soon.\"\n\nBoth qb's ended up play a fine amount of time when Steelman was pulled in the 4th quarter after he was hit hard on a scramble. Before he left the game Steelman showed of is legs and arm by amassing nearly 100 yrds in both passing and rushing. Most of his passing yards came on a hail mary pass caught by junior wr justin allen at the end of the first half that was took to the endzone with 00 on the clock. That put army up 14-3 going into half time. Other points where a NW field goal by Jeff Budzien early in the 1st and a rushing td by junior rb Malcom Brown with less then 2mins left in the half.\n\nAlex Carlton hit a fg in the third and the NW great qb Dan Persia showed his legs off on a 45 yard run for a td. North western inched closer to army's lead by adding another Jeff Budzien fg, but a great retern by rb john crucitti that took army deep into Northwestern's end of the field. Jared Hassin plowed in to the endzone to put the knights almost out of reach by NW with the time remaining. With less then 1min left nw was stopped on 4th down and army took over again. Then knock out blow came seconds later when rb Marcus McInerny found his way into the endzone to seal the deal.\n\nPlayer of the game was junior fb jared hassin who had over 100 yards and a td.\n\nNorthwestern falls to 1-2 record and Army keeps it winning ways at 3-0. Next week is at mac school ball state where the cardinals look to right the ship on this early season, but it wont be an easy go for them. \"We know they are not they best team and we should be them no problem but we still have to go to them and keep the intensity up, we cant take them lightly or we will get beat.\" said head couch Atherton.

{"body":"I'm not so sure about that. There's recent precedent for the GOP nominating the candidate who has simply stuck around the longest. Dole in 1996, McCain in 2008. Neither were the most electable candidates or particularly charming/interesting characters. They won because they were angry old men and Republicans love a good authority figure. Sound familiar? The GOP rejected Romney in 2008 when he was, in some ways, a less flawed candidate. They are desperate to find someone, anyone, else to support. I think any of the 'flavor of the month' candidates could have won but Newt just got lucky with the timing. There will be a bit of a media slow down throughout Christmas and the New Year and then you've got Iowa. There isn't really enough time for another major sea-change. Also it's worth considering the Republicans haven't had a protracted nomination battle in quite a long time. My guess is if Newt wins IA, loses NH but is competitive, and comes back to win SC/FL they will rally behind him. His candidacy will be be a sort of Palin 2.0 as the media digs into his bizarre past and he is easily flustered by scrutiny. It will still be a fairly close election though with Newt going after the Bush 04 states. Rubio as VP might be good enough to get him FL and the demographics of OH are going to favor an old white man running for President. Even though McCain lost it in 2008 he did better in OH than many expected. If that strategy plays out it forces Obama to win AZ, VA or NC. Not an easy task.

He'll pull too many independents - Republicans make up a significantly smaller percentage of registered voters than Democrats and have to win 2/3 of the independents to make up the difference.  Additionally, within the GOP, Paul's support is in the mid teens.  It's well understood that Paul voters just won't accept anyone else.  Paul stripping 10-15% of the GOP and seizing even 20% of independents would produce a guaranteed loss for the Republican candidate.  Paul is an acceptable alternative for most Republican voters, even the ones who support Romney or Cain.  But Romney and Cain are NOT acceptable alternatives to Republican voters who support Paul.  Paul is the only Republican who can hold the base vote together while drawing in very large numbers of independents.  And by the way, a lot of young Democrats support Paul after witnessing the hypocrisy of Obama's first term.

I see no reason for this to change, but I also don't really see a legitimate reason why one of them couldn't be a factor.  \n\nAnd Ron Paul: He's polling at around 20%, right? But I sincerely doubt that he clinches the nomination for a couple of different reasons. One, he has positions that directly contradict strict Republican orthodoxy. I fail to see how someone can win the support of the Republican base with Paul's stance on Israel. Ron Paul's negatives numbers - numbers of Republican voters who like him the least or would not consider voting for him - are huge.

Romney could very well play the waiting game and underperform in the first couple of primaries under the assumption that it is only a matter of time before Gingrich's campaign implodes under the pressure of media attention.

Ron Paul wants the free market and reputation to determine regulation but That will create even more of a monopolized capitalistic economy. The industries will band together to maximize their profits and become an unstoppable monster. Ron Paul wants to go back to early America runaway capitalism and yet says nothing about breaking up trusts or prosecuting the robber barons that created so many problems back then. The fact is during that era there was more corruption and lower quality of life for the average man. I agree big government is much more involved in our social experiences than it should be but our \"money is speech\" oligarchy is only going to get worse if we deregulate to RP's standards.

{"body":"What is this wizardry? A thread about Ron Paul that isn't downvoted to oblivion? How refreshing...\n\nAs an RP supporter, I accept many others are way too optimistic about what he can actually pull off. I on the other hand am a little more realistic, but still I don't think you should underestimate what an RP win would mean for the country. This my list:\n\n1) If RP wins, it means none of the others won. 'Nuff said.\n\n2) A lot of us hate the direction the republican party has taken this past decade. Liberals/Progressives and us have a lot in common in this category. A Ron Paul win would shake the party to its very core, in a way it hasn't happened in a long time. We are trying to change the party from within and there are a lot of neocons scared out of their minds right now, they refuse to accept their power over the party is slipping. We want to bring it back to true conservatism but letting people live their lives in peace, and so far because of RP's message, many young people (like me :D) have become interested in politics and joined the party with these ideals, and will be a factor in the party for many years to come. Libertarianism didn't start and doesn't end with Ron Paul. This is just beginning.\n\n3) Regarding a Ron Paul presidency, the major thing that will change is our foreign policy. I think this is pretty obvious. People have forgotten just how much say the President has in this. Obama could easily end all the wars right now if he wanted, he can't blame Congress on this one. Ron Paul said it straight up in a debate, he doesn't care what the generals say, or what anyone says, he will end the wars as fast as possible.\n\n4) Another thing he could do is repeal all the unconstitutional powers the executive branch has stolen from Congress over all these past administrations. A limited President is a good President, and he knows this. Many laws and agencies were started just with an executive order. These things are all unconstitutional and should be repealed. If the country wants them, let the Congress vote.\n\n5) His presidency would also be a big step into introducing new ideas into the current debate, which are solely needed at this time. State of the Union saying how the war on drugs hasn't worked and we need to look for alternatives? Yes please. Press conference talking about how the Fed devalues our money whenever they print it? Yes please. Speeches talking about trading with other nations and not having to invade everything under the Sun? Yes please. \n\nThis is important to understand. RP can bring a very important debate to the national discourse. New ideas would be introduced and discussed, the media can't ignore a President talking about these things. They can't ignore it and laugh it off like they do now. The most important legacy of his campaign are these new ideas and education. With a presidency this would have no limits, he wants to convince you that its the right thing to do, he wouldn't use executive power to do his way.\n\nAnyway these are just some points out the top my head. Hopefully you get the picture. The debate would change, and that's just as important as any law passed or repealed. It would be a beginning to something new and exciting in this country. The same old, same old, can't continue forever. Thanks.","subreddit_id":"t5_2sgee","subreddit":"2012Elections"}

The way out of this mess is in *electing* Presidents who will appoint SC Justices that will rule in favor of campaign finance reform, and in *electing* Congressmen &amp; Senators who will do the same. \n\nFeeling good in the voting booth and voting for the pure 3rd party isn't going to do it; they're pure because they've never had to get their hands dirty. To end the problem of corporate money in elections requires voting for the specific Democrats (and when possible Republicans) who support campaign finance reform (IMO full public funding would be best, but real reform is incremental, that won't be the first step). The candidates that will actually bring positive change won't be pure, and they will only at best achieve incremental change once in office. But this is how it's done; the recent Republican policy victories are built on a 47 year old long-term vision and years of effort with many small steps forward and some steps backward. If you want change, might as well start taking those small steps, laying the foundation for future policy victories. Whatever you believe, one party is clearly a better vehicle for the change you seek than the other one. That's the way forward. ","subreddit_id":"t5_2sgee","subreddit":"2012Elections"}

{"body":"It's a difficult issue. I support some of the things Ron Paul says, and I think he's extremely brave, particularly because he's a registered Republican, to be speaking out against war in the way that he is. He still uses different arguments in opposition to it than left-wing progressives do, but it's a type of message that's sorely missing from today's debate.\n\nIn my case it's mostly moot, however, as I'm not even a US citizen and won't be voting, but it's none the less interesting to see that Ron Paul's support among young voters, who you'd expect to be out there working on Obama's behalf, is so high because of, for a large part, his anti-interventionist stance. It really shows that people are becoming increasingly aware of just how destructive US foreign policy is, and also how ideologically close the mainstream candidates are from either party. It's important that people realize this given the reach and breadth of US power.\n\nI don't think that Ron Paul will actually end the wars even if elected, though. He'd probably be impeached well before any actual policy to that extent could be enacted. It's probably a better idea to seek out other ways of ending the US imperialist agenda, given that he's wrong on so many other topics (complete deregulation, the dismantling of important government agencies and services such as social security and healthcare, thinks global warming is the \"greatest hoax that's been around for years\", opposes abortion laws, and a whole host of other things that I won't mention for brevity).

His home in North Las Vegas, purchased more than a decade ago when the neighborhood was more desert than development, is worth less than a third of its former value.\n\n&gt; Yet Tingley, a Republican-leaning independent, has heard nothing meaningful from the GOP hopefuls about the collapse of the housing market or the resulting implosion of Nevada's building industry, which, experts say, may take decades to recover.

{"body":"2) Or we could call them special-interest tax loopholes, and then effectively close those loopholes by lowering the taxes on *everyone* to attract employers back from Asia.\n\n3) No, but I'm not sure which part you're referring to.\n\nThere is nothing inherently wrong with being wealthy. What matters is how that wealth was acquired. It's extremely important to distinguish between wealth acquired justly (through voluntary mutually-agreed transactions between a buyer and seller) and wealth acquired unjustly (through coercion, fraud, or government manipulation).\n\nWal-mart, for example, generates a lot of real (and just) wealth by developing efficiencies in the marketplace. This creates wealth for both them and their customers and suppliers. They also generate a lot of unjust wealth for themselves (and their shareholders) by scamming their suppliers, pressuring governments for special tax treatment and eminent domain land thefts, etc.\n\nIt's difficult to make a lot of money by defrauding people, and it will usually land you in jail eventually. So instead, many of the people at \"the top\" got there by using the power of government against their competitors (and even customers, sometimes). They do this by purchasing politicians and media outlets, and by infiltrating regulatory agencies.\n\nIf we want things to change, we should do what we can to distinguish between the just and unjust wealth that a person or corporation acquires. Then we must figure out how each of these people or corporations are doing the latter, and put a stop to it. In general, you can't use the government to stop it, since they already own the government, so you must do it by spreading the word of their actions, helping those who have been defrauded by their actions, and voting with your wallet by not conducting business with them.\n\nThe fact that corporations have more legal protections than people in many cases is indicative of how screwed up our system is.\n\nAlso, what do you do when all of these rich people decide to move out of the country, and they take our jobs with them? They don't like being taxed any more than you do.\n\n&gt; I'm sorry, but the European nations are in my opinion more civilised because they don't let their citizens get away with a raw deal.\n\nRemember that societies are made up of individuals. Whenever you use the government to give someone something, you are taking it away--forcefully--from someone else. That doesn't sound civilized to me, that sounds coercive.\n\n&gt; They protect their citizens' interest, their wealth, health and defence.\n\nAt the expense of other citizens' interests, etc. Unless taxation is truly voluntary, you are effectively pointing a gun at one person to transfer their wealth to another person.\n\nIf we are going to have taxes and government services, they should be collected and administered at as local a level as possible so that the burden of moving out of the tax district is as low as possible. Don't like the taxes and services? Move to the town down the road where taxes and services are less.\n\n&gt; Socio-democratic systems work far better than rabid mindless capitalism.\n\nMany of these countries are nearing bankruptcy. Just because it works for a while doesn't mean it's sustainable. Also, if the U.S. wasn't subsidizing national defense globally, most countries would have far less to spend on social programs before they went bankrupt.\n\nIn any case, actual \"capitalism\" is nothing more than the freedom to exchange with others as we see fit. It is a voluntary system. Our mixed economy is the cause of most of our problems--when government mixes with business, the natural market forces are corrupted and capital is misallocated.\n\n5) Ron Paul wants to transfer federal control of the abortion debate back to the states where he believes it belongs according to the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThose who view the fetus as a human with human rights view the rights of the fetus as equal to the rights of the mother, since they are both human. If Ron Paul did not view the fetus as human with human rights, he would certainly have no interest in telling women not to abort--just as he does not tell people that they cannot do drugs.","subreddit_id":"t5_2sgee","subreddit":"2012Elections"}

{"body":"So you're saying them not paying any income taxes, though they do pay payroll taxes, is a bad thing? Why would you want to increase the overall spending burden on the people who are the least able to recover from it?\n\nThe argument that taxes are compounded is true, but we're talking about *sales* taxes, not *income* taxes. Business expenses are deductible from gross income, so businesses don't pay taxes at the income level to produce goods. They only pay it on their profit, which is only a small percentage of the price of the good or service.\n\nSales taxes are 6%-8% depending on your state, while income taxes are 25%-40% depending on your income level and your state. Cain's plan would increase that sales tax to 15%-17%, and since poor people don't pay income taxes anyway, they'd just see the price of **everything** go up. Imagine paying 17% tax on a car, or a house. That's ridiculous! \n\nThe government keeps income taxes high and sales taxes low to encourage spending. The bigger gap between the two, the more businesses are encouraged to spend. If your company has $100k laying around at the end of the year, the government wants you to spend it, not save it. Saving it benefits you and your banker. Spending it benefits you and the rest of the economy.

{"body":"There are a series of huge differences. Elections have consequences, and the outcomes of the 2010 election are playing out in states where Republicans won big; Wisconsin, Ohio, Florida, and are being felt in states with continuing Republican majorities; Texas, Mississippi, etc. Same thing on the other side in states where Democrats hold majorities; IL, NY, etc. \n\nA few: \n\n*  Taxes: One party generally supports lower taxes for the middle class and poor, the other party supports deep tax cuts for the rich and big business. Who should shoulder the burden for keeping the country running? Whichever way you lean, pretty clear cut choice on this one. \n\n* Attack on food stamps: One party wants to prevent poor &amp; unemployed people from starving to death, the other sees the poor &amp; unemployed as slackers and cheats, and we see attacks on food stamps ramping up in Republican held states. If preventing American citizens from starving to death matters to you, there's one clear option between the two parties.\n\n* Civil unions/Gay Marriage: The Democratic Governors in IL and NY recently signed legislation passed by Democratic majorities in those states, expanding rights for gays. If civil rights matter to you, for gays or anyone, there is a clear difference between the parties. \n\n* Voting rights: Voter ID: All over the country, Republicans are pushing legislation to raise the bar on the ability to vote. Despite no significant voter fraud (aside from Diebold), these new demands most affect college students and low-income minorities, both Democratic groups. On paper these voting requirements look harmless, but so did Jim Crow era voting requirements; the key is in how they will be implemented, and Democratic vote suppression is the name of the game. Meanwhile, there is no effort by Democrats to disenfranchise Republican voters. So there's a clear difference here. \n\n* Budget priorities: Look at the Paul Ryan Budget, and look at the Progressive Caucus budget. Stark difference. And if you like the Progressive Caucus budget, the only way to bring that to pass is electing more progressive Democrats. In our winner-take-all system, 3rd parties just aren't going to win. (Primaries are where 3rd parties have excellent opportunity for change, as the Tea Party demonstrated in the Republican primaries in 2010. If Greens or Socialists would run as Democrats in the next Democratic primary, we might see some real progress.)\n\n* Women's healthcare rights: One party generally supports women's healthcare rights, the other clearly does not and is doing all it can to take away this right. Regardless of where you're at on this issue, there is a stark difference between the parties.\n\nI could go on, but you get the picture; whether you are liberal or conservative, there is a clear stark difference on policy and outcomes. \n","subreddit_id":"t5_2sgee","subreddit":"2012Elections"}

{"body":"For starters, it isn't me saying it. But all of the GOP candidates seem to feel that the following Obama Administration regulations are a problem-\n\nDodd Frank Act (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodd_Frank_Act) -regulatory changes covering capital investment by banks and insurance companies, the Act introduces new regulation of hedge funds, alters the definition of accredited investors, requires reporting by all public companies on CEO to median employee pay ratios and other compensation data, enforces equitable access to credit for consumers, and provides incentives to promote banking among low- and medium-income residents.\nAll critics of the act have a problem with how much control the government has over lending policies. And how small businesses are punished and unable to receive loans. \n\nAnother major \"job limiting\" policy, again, according to the candidates, are the Obama policies holding back energy expansion. Newt Gingrich probably explains it the easiest -http://www.newt.org/solutions/american-energy-plan. It goes to note here that ALL of the candidates have nearly identical job growth plans in respect to energy expansion. \nAll of candidates also believe that the Obama corporate tax increases are hurting businesses, and are keeping companies away from investing further in the US. Reducing the tax increases (each candidate has a different number they would lower it to) would increase corporate profits, resulting in more investments and more jobs. \n\nThey are also all in unison in amending Sarbanes-Oxley. (also known as the 'Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act' )  It was signed in 2002, and is not Obama-era, but he hasn't done anything to stop it either. As Ron Paul put it, \"\"These regulations are damaging American capital markets by providing an incentive for small US firms and foreign firms to deregister from US stock exchanges. According to a study by a researcher at the Wharton Business School, the number of American companies deregistering from public stock exchanges nearly tripled during the year after Sarbanes\u2013Oxley became law, while the New York Stock Exchange had only 10 new foreign listings in all of 2004. The reluctance of small businesses and foreign firms to register on American stock exchanges is easily understood when one considers the costs Sarbanes\u2013Oxley imposes on businesses. According to a survey by Korn/Ferry International, Sarbanes\u2013Oxley cost Fortune 500 companies an average of $5.1 million in compliance expenses in 2004, while a study by the law firm of Foley and Lardner found the Act increased costs associated with being a publicly held company by 130 percent.\" In other words, yet again, it keeps companies from wanting to expand in the US, and is keeping profits and jobs overseas. \n","subreddit_id":"t5_2sgee","subreddit":"2012Elections"}

{"body":"You know, your tactic here is transparent, and it's also wrong. You are trying to make the case  that methodological naturalism is not based in evidence, and therefore not scientific, which would invalidate my primary claim that Ron Paul isn't a believer in science and therefore unfit to be President.\n\nIt's a tactic that makes me groan, because it can only be based on an ignorance of science.\n\nMethodological naturalism is an assumption of science which forms a component of the scientific method. It's the idea that when a person is doing science, that they do not invoke supernatural causes or explanations. It is different from naturalism because methodological naturalism only requires that the scientist act in a certain way, not believe in a certain way. That means that a religious person may believe in god, but when they are doing science they use a naturalistic methodology which doesn't hypothesize anything supernatural.\n\nThe reason why methodological naturalism is essential to science is that without it, anything at all could be explained with a supernatural cause. Why do apples fall from trees? Because god moves them downwards. Why do airplanes fly? Because angels are carrying them. Why is my appendix inflamed? Because a demon is located inside it.\n\nSupernatural explanations do not actually explain anything, and they form an ending point of inquiry. If you ask the question and answer the question with a supernatural cause, then there is no experiment which can tell you if it right or wrong. Supernatural things are not testable. There are no further questions to ask, because no tests can be conducted on supernatural entities.\n\nNow to address the question about contradiction. It's not contradictory because it's a component of science. Science is not a thing, it's a process. It's a particular procedure which has been designed to develop answers to questions, to check those answers, and to support the development of explanations of phenomena. Methodological naturalism is an assumption which is at the core of that process.\n\nHow do we know that methodological naturalism is true? We don't. All we have is a few hundred years of unprecedented success in using it, and it seems to work really well. We have used the scientific method to analyze the scientific method, and guess what. It shows that using the scientific method, your certainty that you know something is true increases with the testing. Without the scientific method, your certainty that you know something is equal to random chance and remains constant. The evidence that the scientific method is an outstanding success is everywhere, and only the most ignorant person would claim otherwise. \n\nBlack and white thinking won't  get you far. An assumption of philosophical naturalism is not a case of being scientific, or nonscientific. The categories are actually the process of science, ideas which are compatible with knowledge gained with the scientific method, and ideas which are contradictory with knowledge gained with the scientific method. Methodological naturalism is not incompatible with the scientific method. It forms a component of that method. It is actually how all science is done. But on the other hand, Ron Paul's creationism is completely contradictory to the scientific method. Creationism does not describe at all how the world works. The disagreement is profound, and obvious. Creationism is not compatible with science, not even a little bit.\n\nAs far as who said methodological naturalism is necessary to pursue science, look to Francis Bacon and others, like Voltaire, who first defined the scientific method. The reason I say it's definitional is that if you're using methodological naturalism, you're doing something else. An analogy would be to say that hitting a nail with a hammer is part of the definition of a process called \"nailing two boards together\". If you are instead screwing screws, then you are doing something different than \"nailing two boards together.\"\n\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2sgee","subreddit":"2012Elections"}

{"body":"His flaws are thus:\n\n1. He speaks from the heart. This impairs him when dealing with the media or anyone with a short attention span. It takes study and fact checking to fully understand his ideas. All of the depth and inter-connectedness of his arguments is lost. He has gotten magnitudes better in the last 4 years at soundbite speaking but still the major flaw.\n\n2. He associates with the principles of Ayn Rand, which most everyone I speak to, completely misunderstand. Trade is not selfishness, it is mutual benefit. Legislation is not selfishness, it is manipulation. She has this elitist dystopian bent about her which rubs people the wrong way and rightfully so. However, it's transparent and easy to factor out of the underlying principles.\n\n3. He takes a bold approach. This scares the people because they don't know how he intends it to work. This requires a lot of time and moreso, an unprejudiced open mind to understand.\n\n4. He speaks as if he were the executive, yet doesn't explain often enough that he can only make executive branch decisions without breaking the law. (signing statements break the law) Executive decisions are focused in foreign affairs, military and the cabinet agencies are the alphabet agencies, DOE, FDA, DOJ, EPA, DOI, HUD, etc. Even they have Congressional mandates he cannot override without a fight. All of Fed Gov is a quagmire at this time. Conflicts of interest galore. The EB is the craziest.\n\n5. His stance on property is strict and he tries to explain why, but fails because a great many people don't respect property rights. This is an issue because all of his environmental stances originate from this self policing aspect of (actually enforcable) property rights.  This requires tort reform, so people have the ability to pursue property damage claims (which would normally be overridden by an alphabet agency) without risking bankruptcy. This is also a double edged sword as medical malpractice and insurance gouging has shown, thus should be a very hotly debated topic.\n\n6. People have been conditioned that without big government, the sky would fall.  (well, I guess this isn't a fault of his.)  But this is partly true. Strip Big Gov to zero in one day, and there will be mass genocide, mostly famine. Ron doesn't do a well enough job emphasizing transition and doesn't admit enough that transition will take longer than two of his terms. It also will likely never be complete in a stark libertarian outlook. Compromise is different from mob rule, which is what the Fed Gov exhibits now and calls compromise. People just don't think this is possible, but that's silly. \n\nPhew, that was long and still incomplete, but I could go on forever about the nuances of the war between the individual and the collective in which Ron is deeply involved. (at this point only on an intellectual level. Congress often legislatively lynches or ignores anything he has to offer.)\n\nHope that helps. It's taken me years to appreciate both Ron, his opposition and to have any sort of conviction in the confusing quagmire of US politics.

{"body":"If civil rights, whether the poor &amp; unemployed starve to death, voting rights, and womens' healthcare rights are \"little\" details that can be cast aside, that's a scary level of ideology you're on that you'd place your *want* of a certain kind of government over the rights and life-or-death *needs* of millions of your fellow citizens. That's precisely what we're currently seeing from those on the right that are blackout-drunk on ideology, and what history has shown of their counterparts on the left (Mao's China, Soviet Union, etc). \n\nA radical departure from the status quo brings misery and suffering (and often death) upon the weak and vulnerable and exposed, and worst of all the change is spread too thin, not built upon a foundation, and will likely fall in favor of a mutated form of what it overthrew (see Russia post 1990, Germany post 1945, France post 1800, etc).  \n\nSteady incremental change is lasting change. It will take us a lifetime to get to where we want to go, and the early years in that are best spent laying a solid foundation for future gains to be built upon. From a liberal/left POV, getting a liberal majority on the Supreme Court is an essential early step, needed to pave the way for campaign finance reform. The Obama health insurance reform is a foundation onto which more extensive coverage is being built upon. That's why the right fought that so viciously, despite the Obama plan being rather minimal. And minimal as it was, it only barely passed through Congress. With more progressive Democrats, a more bold healthcare bill could have been passed through. Getting more progressive Democrats elected is another layer of foundation that more ambitious gains can come from, but to do that we need to show some real results based in what we have to work with now (and due to that limitation, those results will of course be modest and incomplete, as it always is early in a long-term movement). \n\nIn short, IMO Obama fucked up setting the bar so high with the hope and change rhetoric, leading people on the expectation that they could get decades of change in a single term. (Though I don't think he or anyone imagined that Republicans would take to intentionally deliberately damaging the country for their own electoral gain, that is a dramatic departure from 'business as usual', and I don't know that there's a historical precedent in the US for that). It took Republicans 45 years to go from LBJ's 'Great Society' to the Tea Party vision of America playing out in Republican-held states today, and it will take the left at least that long to get things where we want them. From a liberal/left POV, electing progressive Democrats is the way to that goal. ","subreddit_id":"t5_2sgee","subreddit":"2012Elections"}

{"body":"What in the world does dividends have to do with the cost of goods? *After* you've sold your goods and *after* you've paid your expenses, you have money left (profit) that you can give away to shareholders or burn in your fireplace if you want. Shareholders aren't entitled to a certain dividend. If you build dividend payments into the cost of your goods, then that's fine if your customers will pay it, but it's not an inherent assumption in business that your shareholders receive dividends. And it's actually more expensive for you to do it that way. \n\nThe reason that sales taxes are lower than income taxes is to encourage spending instead of saving. If you want to pay your shareholders, then that's fine, but just know that you'll be paying more for that than you would if you bought a new tractor. Lowering the income tax, or worse flattening it to put it on par with sales tax, will only encourage companies to save. Again, that's good for banks, but not for anybody else. We want you to buy tractors, not bury your money in the backyard. The tax rate really doesn't affect bourgeoning companies, just greedy ones that choose to sit on their money. \n\nMy company had about $4M in gross sales last year and we have about a 12% profit rate before reinvestments and R&amp;D. So I can opt to put that $480k in the bank and earn 3% on my money and pay 35% tax on it (leaving me with a 32% effective tax rate), or I can choose to reinvest that money in my company and do more R&amp;D with it and pay 7% sales tax on it. I can also pay my employees more if I have money just sitting around, which is also deductible. And if the rate was 90%, it would only encourage me to spend more to avoid paying that rate. Any company can control what they spend and what they save. So the argument that there's uncertainty for businesses is just false. There's uncertainty for banks maybe, but who cares? The banks lobby and fight and bitch and spit for companies to save and for the federal government to flatten the tax to encourage them to save. But they're the only ones that benefit from that. And we see what happens when they get too big.\n\nEDIT: The tax code shows you how the government rates expenditures. Sales are first (7%), investment is second (15%), and saving is last (35%).","subreddit_id":"t5_2sgee","subreddit":"2012Elections"}

Even with that in mind it's still an incredibly damning story because of how long they were actively being published, and the fact that the man who supposedly ghostwrote them (Lew Rockwell) isn't exactly a [complete stranger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lew_Rockwell#Working_for_Ron_Paul) to Ron Paul.

The reason I heard was that feels it's consistent with his pro-life (or: anti-abortion) stance. And yes, he wants a lot of people who are currently doing time for minor drug abuses to be freed, but that's due to his libertarian stance on drug laws rather than the fact minorities are incarcerated disproportionally often. It's actually the same with his anti-war stance: he's an isolationist, and argues against war largely from a practical viewpoint (although he has recently used a number of other, better arguments as well) rather than enunciating what it would mean for the countries that actually get victimized by military interventionism.\n\nAll three of these are stances I happen to agree with, and yet I don't feel comfortable with the way Ron Paul articulates them.

The media does seem to portray these as Paul's positions, but they're more of a caricature of libertarianism than representative of what Paul has actually said. In particular:\n\n* Paul is [not an advocate](http://www.ronpaul2012.com/the-issues/taxes/) of a flat tax or \"fair tax\". He thinks those might be better than what we have now, but would rather not have an income tax or sales tax at all. Leading up to that, he has proposed tax cuts, but not an outright replacement of the tax system.\n* Most flat tax proposals would not tax income below a certain amount at all. I think twice the poverty level is a common figure. The fair tax plan is a sales tax, and would use a [monthly prebate](http://www.fairtax.org/site/PageServer?pagename=about_fairtax_four#regressive) to accomplish the same thing. Again, Paul isn't actually an advocate of these plans.\n* Paul would not eliminate safety net programs in the short term.

{"body":"Add to that that Newt is actually up in the polls in most of the early contests \u2013 more so than anyone else at the moment. His national lead is huge (as much as twenty or more points) and this is reflected in many of the early contests. January especially favors Newt: he\u2019s got a lead in three of the four January primaries, including huge leads in South Carolina and Florida. Iowa is somewhat more tenuous; I think Ron Paul or even Romney could take Iowa. If that happened, it\u2019d be a huge blow to the Gingrich campaign \u2013 and a huge boost to whoever did win. A Ron Paul win would legitimize him as one of the two or three serious contenders, and a Romney victory in Iowa might as well signal the end of the race. But Gingrich *is* currently slated to win Iowa, as well as both early Southern primaries.\n\n Then there\u2019s the matter of \u2018who else?\u2019. This is looking increasingly like a three-way race between Gingrich Romney and Paul. Republican voters seem utterly unwilling to commit to Romney: his national numbers have hovered in the low twenties for months as subsequent contenders have taken the lead (and fallen from grace). If Gingrich fucks up he could be out in a minute; however, he doesn\u2019t have much time left to do so, and his political experience benefits him here: unlike any contender besides Romney, he has been *heavily* involved in political processes such as this one before, and is not only less likely to slip up by now but also has been (alongside Romney) the only consistently strong debator. Most of the others have had their chance and failed. As they drop off in the early primaries, I expect much of their supporters to flock to Gingrich. There\u2019s already rumors of a Cain endorsement coming, and I\u2019d expect candidates like Bachmann, Perry, and Santorum to lend support to Gingrich as they drop out not just because he\u2019s conservative but because he\u2019s run a very friendly campaign, more ready to speak on behalf of his fellow candidates than aggressively against them.\n\nThe reason Gingrich matters is because there\u2019s a good chance he will be the Republican candidate for President. Maybe not a majority chance, but I would not say that for any of the candidates. Romney and Gingrich combined, sure. But if Iowa was tomorrow and the race proceeded from there, it would mostly be between Gingrich and Romney (with Paul) on the side and Gingrich would build an early lead based on results in every primary state besides New Hampshire. The path to the nomination is not just there, it\u2019s pretty clear: he wins Iowa, SC, and Florida, all states he\u2019s leading in. As other candidates drop out, his lead increases, but the next round of states is more Romney friendly: February\u2019s a mix of Southwestern and Upper Midwestern states, all of which Romney stands to do well in. From there though it\u2019s Gingrich vs Romney vs Paul, and unless Mitt Romney can build up some kind of support that he has been unable to so far, Gingrich could well win the nomination. Sure, it\u2019ll be a battle. If it\u2019s especially close \u2013 and if Paul performs well, which could well happen \u2013 we could even see it come down to the Convention. But this is all speculation. We\u2019ll find out in a month. Point is, Gingrich demands to be taken seriously because he\u2019s one of two people who could well be the eventual Republican nominee.\n\n\nPolling data mostly courtesy of RCP: http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/","subreddit_id":"t5_2sgee","subreddit":"2012Elections"}

I know corporations are about the bottom line but will he enact legislation that will stop our tax incentives going to businesses that continually outsource after receiving these breaks? It's a tough question and one he hasn't really answered. However, I am willing to take that risk with him considering his depth of knowledge concerning foreign policy as well as his knowledge of US relations with China. When it comes down to it, if Paul doesn't get the nomination and Huntsman does, he'll have my vote. Yes I'm a \"Circle Jerking Ron Paul Supporter\". He's got some great ideas and he tells the truth which I like. He's a bit idealistic and doesn't plat the popularity game which hurts him.\n\nWhat do you like about Huntsman and dislike about Paul?

Replacing the memory isn't going to void your warranty.  If you have an issue with the computer, they may ask you to put the factory memory back in before they troubleshoot it, so keep it around somewhere safe.  From the user guide, there are 2 slots available for memory.  Open up your laptop and determine if you have any free slots.  I'm willing to bet that they used both slots.\n\nNow I can't find a definitive answer in the [tech specs](http://shop.lenovo.com/us/ww/pdf/B570_Datasheet_US.pdf) but i'ts likely that the laptop will only recognize 4 GB per memory stick, meaning that if you go out and buy a single 8 GB stick of memory, you are going to end up with 4 GB of usable memory.  In any event if you are buying anything bigger than 4 GB, call or email support for Lenovo and make sure it's going to work before you buy it.\n\nIt's best to have 2 matched sticks of memory in your laptop, although it's not critical to do so.

They both cost around $45, but the off-brand version comes with a free 4GB flash card that you can use to readyboost that system (I recommend you do so).

{"body":"The problem with \"upgrading\" is that it will reinstall Windows but keep everything else (old hardware drivers etc) so I don't think that will help anything sadly. That is why I initially just threw out there to reinstall. \n\nBut more of what I was talking about before: you can do a fresh install over your current installation and what it will do is copy your Program Files, your application data, your documents, and everything in your c:\\users\\ *username* folder. Windows will then take all of these folders and place them in c:\\Windows.old where you will be able to access them when you get your new installation up and running. This way won't \"maintain your installations\" per se, but you won't lose them either. What you can do is reinstall them (just to get everything working right with Windows) and then copy over all of your data. Granted you will have to do this with all the programs that you really want to keep but it is better than starting from scratch. \n\nYou can definitely try to delete your old drivers and maintain your current installation but there is always a risk in that. What if you don't get all of the old drivers and something is still screwing up? What if old drivers are conflicting with new ones? Those ways could save you a lot of time but they could also cost you some if they don't work out. Is it worth pursuing? Oh yes, I would definitely say in your position it would be.

Odds are, the error listing will mention an executable file related to your display driver(s) and the driver just needs to be reinstalled. ReedRex's post suggests it could be a driver issue.

Is that what you mean by dongle? \n\nNo, some banks can issue you a physical device that keeps a randomized counter on it.  It's done in such a way that the next number is impossible to predict unless you know the initial number it started with.  Hard to explain the theory, but in practice you have to be holding a physical item to log in and it can't be copied.\n\nAll this is pretty pointless though.  You are paranoid about online banking because it's unfamiliar, not because it is unsafe.  My dad wouldn't submit his taxes electronically because he didn't trust it to be safe.  One year a thief took the check out of his mailbox, washed the check, put their own name on it and cashed it.  For all your worrying about your banking info, you hand your credit card to a person you don't know every time you go to a restaurant.  It would be incredibly easy for that person to just write down the numbers and use it later.\n\nMost banks will cover any fraud problems that happen with online banking, or your checks getting stolen, or your credit card number being copied anyways.  It may take time and be annoying but you will get the money back.

(on the command line this would be ssh -D 1234 server). now set your browser/etc. on the mobile to use a SOCKS proxy on localhost:1234.\n\nafaik there's no real alternative to using SOCKS when you just have plain SSH. you could set up port forwarding over ssh and define custom routes on your mobile to tunnel traffic to a specific server through ssh, but the whole internet traffic? i don't think that's possible without the socks 'hack' you'd need a virtual NIC like a vpn provides it to route your traffic through it.","subreddit_id":"t5_2rv00","subreddit":"24hoursupport"}

It seemed to have a dead area or a short.

You could see from the input point tracking bulls-eyes that the points were displaced down and to the left with the points along the left edge being off the screen and the points along the bottom being below the screen.\r\n\r\nAnyway, we couldn't get it to calibrate after resting and revisiting the whole situation today for several hours so she called them up and after being hung up on twice on support calls and spending over an hour on the phone to them she just decided she'd had enough so she had them give a return authorization.\r\n\r\nShe really wanted to get this thing going but now we are looking for something similar from a different vendor.\r\n\r\nThanks again for the reply.","subreddit_id":"t5_2rv00","subreddit":"24hoursupport"}

{"body":"There were solder issues with a lot of nVidia graphics cards a few years back. [This video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR84Dlkt4cQ) would suggest that this was possibly an issue for your model of laptop as well. You can attempt to \"reflow\" the solder and maybe adjust the cooling system so it doesn't overheat &amp; ruin the solder in the future. This involves heating the GPU up, possibly in the oven or with a heat lamp/heat gun.\n\nGiven that this laptop does have a removable GPU, then you could technically replace the motherboard first &amp; then the GPU if replacing the motherboard fails to fix the problem. It looks like you can find a tested motherboard on eBay for like $80 &amp; a tested SLI GPU for $200. Not that an SLI 8700M is much of a powerhouse these days, if you just want a working laptop then you could get a single one, but it'll be slower, though cheaper.\n\nThe only issue is when you consider laptops like [this](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834215197), which has a GeForce 540M, which is better than your 8700M SLI card &amp; it's about $525 after gift card promo. So for under 2x the cost of parts you could get the new laptop.\n\nI would not spend $700 on repairing this laptop. In the end you might get the service manual then part it out on eBay &amp; maybe get $100 - $200 for the screen, CPU, motherboard(AS-IS), GPU(AS-IS), chassis, &amp; drives or just put the whole thing up AS-IS. \n\n\n**TLDR**: Try to reflow video card solder, if fails put it up on eBay AS-IS &amp; use money towards a new laptop. Though if you want something more reliable that's not going to crap out on you again(it probably will even if reflow works), buy a new laptop.\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2rv00","subreddit":"24hoursupport"}

{"body":"While 100% is not exactly attainable, one of the best efforts to detect viruses is this: keep the computer offline for a while (the longer the better - maybe you can do this for 3 days) because some viruses update themselves automatically to try to stay ahead of virus scanners and remain undetectable.  Then, scan the computer with a virus scanner **after booting from an external drive**.  \n\nRootkits - such as the nasty, sneaky, TDSS bank-info-stealing rootkit - embed themselves so deeply that they can hide themselves from being visible to the OS's file system, which means that the virus scanner won't be able to detect that the virus's files even exist, let alone scan them.  By booting from an external drive, this is bypassed.  \n\nMicrosoft makes an excellent tool for this (for free).  Avast probably does also but I don't know if theirs is free when you only have their free version.  There are also plenty of free bootable tools, like Hiren's Boot CD, that will allow this.  \n\nThe first thing I recommend you do, though, is to scan your computer with MBAM.  \n\n------------\nAlso, don't bank through a wireless connection unless you're using a VPN / tunneling to secure it.  **ALL** Wi-Fi encryption is insecure and pretty easily crackable.

The concept of the freezing trick relies on the heads being \"stuck\" on the platters or something else being stuck. The hope is that the cold will cause the parts to expand and contract \"freeing\" the stuck part.  Your drive is having a power issue, not a physical issue.  The cold will probably just hurt the drive more than help it.\n\nThe PCB swap *could* fix the issue, but you need to be sure to get as close to the original drive as possible.  This usually goes beyond make and model and extends to the firmware revision and manufacture date.  Swapping the board itself is fairly easily and usually just involves a few T8 screws.\n\nWhat probably is occurring is your HD is shorting out, pulling a ridiculous load from the PSU, activating the Over Current Protection in the PSU, and the PSU shutting down the entire rail to protect itself.

{"body":"Typically the it's the oil, rather than the bearings per se.  It can lose its viscosity after about a half-dozen years of prolonged use.  If you feel ambitious, you can add some oil yourself.  You want fine sewing machine oil, which can be had from any sewing supply store for about $5.  Before you undo the cabling and take the case out of the computer, unplug the computer from the wall and then hold down the computer's power button.  The fan might try to spin, and some of the LEDs will come on briefly.  This will drain the capacitors on the MB and inside the PS.  A discharge from a live cap can be dangerous.\n\nUnplug the PS and take it out of the case.  Then get a screwdriver and remove the metal casing on the PS.  Find the fan, and get to the side where a little sticker covers the electric motor (that'll be the side that *doesn't* spin when the fan does).  With a razor blade or pen-knife, carefully peel up *some* of the sticker, until you can see the spindle that runs through the middle of the motor.  Some fans keep this covered with just the sticker, others have a little plastic plug over it that you will have to pry out with a knife-tip.  A couple of drops should do.  Move the fan a bit with your finger or a pencil to work the oil into things.  Then give it a test spin or two to see if it still feels sticky.  Put the plastic plug back in, and get the sticker back over everything (don't want the oil to leak out or dry up). Get it all back together and you shouldn't have to worry about it for several more years.  Although, since you have your supplies with you, you might as well lube up the case and heat-sink fans while you're at it.\n\nSome PSs have a finger-guard over the fan that is screwed on from the outside.  If that's the situation, and you can see the stickered-side of the fan, you won't even need to open up the PS.\n\nAlso, you can use 3-in-1 oil in a pinch, but don't expect it to work as well or last as long.  Some 3-in-1s are vegetable-based oil.  If it is, it'll probably gum up again after about a year.  If that happens, you're better off just buying a new PS.\n\nEdit:  I can't believe I forgot to mention.  **Do not** use WD-40.

{"body":"You have the right idea.\n\nWhen a file is deleted on FAT or NTFS, the file contents aren't deleted, the file \"pointer\" is merely removed. So as far as the machine knows, it's gone. The file can still be recovered because the data is still there. \n\nWhat happens when you wipe out the FAT? You can still recover some data because you can read the \"lost\" data on the disk.\n\nNow, if you were to take a **ghost** images of this disk, it wouldn't take the deleted files. To it, it doesn't exist therefore doesn't need to be backed up. That's how it compresses well. \n\nWhen you take a **dd** image of a disk, it takes a bit-wise copy from sector zero all the way to the end of the disk (or however you specify). That means the entire disk is compressed, including all the 'lost' data that still lives on the disk. \n\nHowever, I remember a setting in *Ghost* that says the level of compression: High, Fast and None.

{"body":"Here's a simple breakdown of what occurs and what \n\nuser requests domain.com -&gt; ISP DNS (assuming its not cached already) -&gt; tld (top level domain, e.g., .com, .net, .ca, etc) authority -&gt; authoritative nameservers for this domain (what you setup on godaddy) -&gt; nameservers with domain.com zone file to point www/ftp/secure/mail/whatever.domain.com to IP address (of webserver, mailserver, whatever you need)\n\nThe last part is what you need to setup. I don't know your setup but most ISPs and webhosts have their own nameservers, but there are third party nameserver providers. Either way, if you don't have a gui it doesn't sound like you would be comfortable creating zone files by hand. Here's some brief tips:\n\nA records point hostnames to IPs\n\nformat (spacing not important): domain.com   IN     A       123.123.123.1\n        \nMX records are for mail delivery. They *should* point to a hostname (point mail.domain.com to mailserver IP with A record, then use MX record to point domain.com mail to be sent to mail.domain.com) but depending on what you're using, you can point to an IP instead. You may get dinged by spam heuristics if you do that. MX records also have a priority number, so you can have multiple mail servers so that if one is down it will try the next one. Highest priority number is chosen first.\n\ne.g.,\ndomain.com IN MX  10  123.123.123.1 (not best practice)\ndomain.com IN MX  20  mail.domain.com (IP defined in A record)\ndomain.com IN MX  30  mail2.domain.com\n\n\n\nIf you really want to get fancy, you can create an SPF (not in original DNS scope so it uses a TXT record type) record which will tell mail servers you *send* mail to which mail servers are allowed to send mail on behalf of your domain. This could include the mail server (at least SMTP if they are hosted physically on separate hosts than pop3), your webserver (if you use formmail scripts), relay/smtp servers of third party mailing list providers where you would be using an address someone@domain.com as your reply address. SPF records are made easy by free online SPF record creators, it will make the string you can put into your zone file based on a form you fill out. Make sure you use a softfail option, a hardfail will tell servers receiving mail from your domain that if the relay server is not in the list, then reject the mail. A softfail will allow the mail to go through but flag it as failing the SPF check.\n\nHope that helps and wasn't too much information at once.","subreddit_id":"t5_2rv00","subreddit":"24hoursupport"}

{"body":"Here's an e-mail I got. So basically either a wombat or badger ate through some of they physical wiring or my school is full of it.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nI'm not sure what your experience is with computer networks and this\nquestion comes up quite a bit. To be safe, we assume that we are\nexplaining the problem to someone who does NOT have a\nbackground with computer networks and we ask that you please\nnot take offence if something comes across as being too \"basic\"\nto have been described. On the other side, if there is anything\nabout which you have questions, please feel free to ask and I or\na co-worker will answer to the best of our ability with as much\ndetail as possible.\n\nThe University's Internet connection is a two-part problem to solve.\nOne part is the amount of bandwidth we pay for, the other is what the\nphysical connection can handle.  The physical connection is the actual\nbottleneck. That connection has a physical theoretical maximum rate of\n622 Mbps, 622 Megabits per second. One Megabit is roughly equal to\n1,000 Kb, 1,000 Kilobits, so that theoretical maximum is about 622,000\nKilobits per second, and we use the full amount.\n\nThe underlying physical connection has an overhead of about 10 - 15%,\nso our maximum is really closer to 550,000 Kbps.\n\nOut of that 550,000 Kbps, we allocate 50,000 Kbps, 50 Mbps, for the\nUniversity to video/audio conference with other universities and\ninstitutions.\n\nOf the remaining 500,000 Kbps, students are allocated 360,000 Kbps.\nThat's 360 Mbps, or approximately 70% of the University's bandwidth,\n*specifically* allotted for student use. That doesn't include labs or\nanything like that, it is *purely* personally owned student computers,\nand it runs at its limit from approximately 11:00 AM until\napproximately 2:00 AM. From about 2 AM until about 10 AM we see\nvery little usage of the student networks, and the usage we do see\nis much faster per-person than in the afternoon/evening/night.\n\nThat leaves about 140,000 Kbps for the administrative functions of the\nUniversity - staff and faculty Internet use, public lab use, visitors\n(which includes computers belonging to a friend that a student may\nbring to campus) and University servers.\n\nThe 360,000 Kbps for students is further divided. We put a \"1/10\"\nrestriction per device, meaning *if the bandwidth is available*, a\nsingle computer can use up to 10,000 Kbps, or 10 Mbps, of bandwidth.\nIf it is not available, they are allowed, at most, 1,000 Kbps, or 1\nMbps.\n\nEven allowing, or trying to allow, that much per student is\nproblematic because we have 5,000 residential students and 15,000 that\nare on-campus for classes (that 15,000 is an approximation to make\nthe arithmetic clean, the number is slightly higher). 360,000 Kbps\ndivided into 5,000 devices (one per student) is just under 75 Kbps per\ndevice. 75 Kbps is approximately 0.075 Mbps. Now consider\nthose numbers and consider that we have an additional ten thousand\nnon-residential students that bring multiple devices to\ncampus and the theoretical allowance, per device, becomes\na much, much smaller number - closer to 0.025 Mbps - so the\n1/10 limit, in reality, has very little (if any) impact on students.\n\nWhen people are primarily using the Internet for things like Facebook,\ne-mail or general web browsing, it's not usually an issue to be so\nover-subscribed. With the proliferation of Peer-to-Peer software,\nNetFlix, YouTube, Hulu, Skype, GrooveShark, Pandora and other services\nthat stream audio and video, it suddenly has become a much larger\nissue. There *are* initiatives in progress to address the physical\nInternet connection, allowing us to better meet the demand brought\non by the recent boom of both end-user devices and bandwidth-intensive\ngames and streaming audio/video formats.","subreddit_id":"t5_2rv00","subreddit":"24hoursupport"}

{"body":"I thought I'd update you on where I am. Thanks again for your input.\n\nToday, I took the computer apart to find the part number, following your comment and using the [maintenance and service guide](http://www.dectrader.com/docs/set5/c01550108.pdf) for my machine. It was easy for the most part, although popping the bevel was a little finicky, and a couple of the clasps broke.\n\nWhen I finally got the LCD out and looked at the back, there wasn't an HP sticker, but an LG one. Fair enough-- I can understand using screens made by another company. Searching for the part number gave me results that looked promising.\n\nAs I was putting it back together, after reattaching the display, I noticed that, where the display panel cable attached to the \"system board\" (as the manual calls it), there was an HP sticker with a part number on it. When searched, the part that popped up was *also* an LCD screen that fit my specifications. If I had checked that sticker out earlier, I could have saved myself the hassle of disassembling the display!\n\nI haven't purchased the part yet, because there's one thing I'm slightly concerned about. My issue is *not* lines of constantly dead pixels. Right now, for instance, my screen is displaying perfectly fine. Rather, it will randomly start producing these lines at the top and the bottom of the screen that can best be described as \"static,\" dancing up and down. When this happens, I can usually remedy it temporarily by adjusting the angle of my screen. All this makes me think it's an issue with a connection or a cable, *not* a dying display. Does this make sense? if the issue is with a cable and not the LCD, I'm worried about spending $100 to replace a part that's perfectly fine.","subreddit_id":"t5_2rv00","subreddit":"24hoursupport"}

{"body":"Here;'s how I would do it...\n\nCable model is your external IP. That's where your users will want to attempt to log in to. &lt;yourip&gt;:25565 which is the default port for MCserver.\n\nYour router/wap should be running in DHCP mode, which will assign IPs to whatever hosts request one, almost everything these days has a dhcp client to connect to a wap or other network service appliance. In the settings, you should see a DHCP server, which should have an IP range that looks like 192.168.x.x. Your devices probably pull a 192.168.1.x address from the available address pool on the DHCP server. Let's say the server has a pool of 192.168.1.2 to 192.168.1.50 (usually .1 is reserved for itself). Subnet mask is probably 255.255.255.0 which gives you 254 addresses on the 1.x subnet. So, if you configure your laptop/pc to use 192.168.1.100 (outside the DHCP range) but within the subnet range 255.255.255.0, and your gateway as the router, 192.168.1.1, you should have connectivity. This is an example. You will have to see what IP range your particular router is set up for, it does differ from time to time. Leave DHCP server on in the router settings, but use a static outside the DHCP range but within the subnet to have internet service.\n\nOnce you have a static set up and working properly, go back to your router's settings and set up a port forward. Forward all traffic for the port 25565 to go to the static you set up for your server. That way, all minecraft port traffic coming inbound should hit the IP of your server only.\n\nSo long as you have a static working, and you have a port forward correctly set up, you should be able to log in from anywhere online. THis is contingent upon all of your settings being correct, though. Google up a guide to port forwarding on your model router.\n\nYou can run windows firewall, but just be sure you create a rule allowing inbound traffic on 25565 (or whatever port you choose to run MC server on).\n\nThere may be other router settings that would affect it as well, some comsuner grade routers block all sorts of things and have things turned off that need to be on in order for them to function the way you want. It varies from device to device. Usually the settings are the way they are to protect naive users against accidentally opening the internet to their machine. Just look around for some tips on your model.\n\nYour server config should not have an IP in it, and should reflect port 25565, as well as online mode = true.

Place it on a non conductive surface. Plug your 24 pin and your 4/6/8 pin atx into the board (the power cables).\n\n\nTurn on the power supply. If you don't have a jumper, take a paper clip or other small conductive item, and connect the 2 pins that control the power switch (usually labeled PW SW, or something similar. Refer to your motherboard manual if you have trouble locating them). This will pass power through to the components on the board.\n\n\nFirst thing you should notice is the heatsink fan spinning up. After a second or 2, most boards will beep or give some other indication that there is no memory present on the board. In this case a beep/indication is good, as it means that there is no problem with your processor/the portion of the board that directly interfaces with the processor.\n\n\nIf there is no indication, beeping or otherwise, contact the ASUS and double check that the board should indeed give you some indication when there is no memory present. If it should beep, however it does not, try re-seating the processor. If this does not work, then there is either an issue with the processor or potentially with the motherboard .\n\nAssuming everything is good up to this point, go ahead and add 1 stick of ram to the board as well as your gfx card (all of this still taking place outside of the case). Plug your monitor into the gfx card, and attempt to boot up again. If it boots at this point w/display, the rest is basic trouble shooting.\n\nGiven that it didn't boot the first time you tried, there is definitely something that's causing trouble. It could be anything from the board shorting on the case due to contact, to an actual hardware issue. It's just a matter of narrowing it down.\n\nPlace everything back in the case. Does it boot?

{"body":"No matter what is done, wireless will generally never reach the same speeds you can expect from a wired connection. It should be faster than what you're currently seeing though.\n\nThe CG3000D is a Wireless N access point, and if your laptop/phone/etc are also Wireless N, you should make sure that you're using WPA2 (WPA2 Personal for this type situation) encryption. If you use WEP or WPA on a Wireless N connection, it will only operate at a maximum of 54Mbps. This may not explain your low rates, but it certainly wouldn't be helping anything.\n\nBe sure that you check the signal level on your laptop/phone/whatever, you may also be seeing reduced rates because of poor signal. Since the CG3000D has no external antenna, its range is likely much less than a router with an external antenna. Wireless speeds drop along with the signal quality. The construction material of your apartment can also greatly affect wireless depending on what the walls are made of. Plaster walls with metal lath, and concrete, are both usually pretty hard on wireless signals.\n\nLastly, use a program like [inSSIDer](http://www.metageek.net/get_inssider_today/) to see what channels the wireless networks around you are operating on. Make sure that you set your network to at minimum, 2-3 channels away from the most crowded channel (probably 1, 6, or 11, so you would use 3 or 9).","subreddit_id":"t5_2rv00","subreddit":"24hoursupport"}

The possibilities are endless and it could be anything (or any combination of things). Ok it can't be anything, but you get my point. I agree that you should use a live linux distro. You should try booting off a live linux cd/dvd/usb and testing your hardware from there. I use an Ubuntu live usb that you can download and  put on almost any usb. After you boot off of the usb, there are specific programs you can run to test all your different hardware components but if it doesn't work (it doesn't boot off the usb) then that rules stuff out. Do you just want to get your data and info off from this computer or do you actually want to fix the computer to use?

The laptop is 2.5 years old and I did not pay for extended service.\n\n* Lastly, as per another users suggestion (the only response I got from r/Techsupport) I changed the CMOS battery with a new one. This also did nothing.\n\nInterestingly, that \"remove big battery, reseat cmos battery, plug in AC adapter\" trick seems to work every time I use it. I've had to do it maybe 4 times now to deal with having to move my computer etc. I've noticed that without the CMOS battery in, all I need to do to boot the computer up is take out the big battery and plug in the AC adapter. \n\nThe more I look at it, and the more people I consult, the more likely it seems that it is a mobo issue. If the power light were not behaving strangely (ie turning on when the AC is in, not just when the computer is on) I would reckon it was the switch itself which has the issue. \n\nIt looks like I may need to pay Fry's or somebody to have it repaired.

{"body":"Ok.. here's what probably happened:\n\n1.) You installed tainted software that either had a trojan or some other malware...... the first time it activated, it probably \"called home\" (to the IP in Minnesota ??).... Likely it was some sort of botnet and the IP in Minnesota is the C&amp;C (command and control server). \n\n2.) When you figured it out.. and wiped/rebuilt your computer.... in theory you are clean now, but the botnet server is still trying to contact you.... which is why you're seeing the probes show up in your Router logs. \n\nSO.... if your Router is doing it's job,.. it should (by default) be blocking any external traffic. There are really only two ways around this: \n\n1.) The trojan/malware somehow modified your Routers port-rules. (IE = it opened a port in order to make sure it could get back in.) The way to check this would be to login to your Routers web-based management page and check the Port Forwarding rules to see if there are any open ports. \n\n2.) The trojan/malware is exploiting a known security hole in your router (for example: you're still running the original default router password,.. or have never updated your Routers firmware ??)\n\nI find #2 highly unlikely.. but I suppose it's possible. \n\n&gt; \"I reformatted the Acer yesterday, but after using it the same bluescreen returned from seemingly out of nowhere so I immediately unplugged everything and shut her down.\"\n\nI think you're probably being overly paranoid.

I'm not even sure that's possible. (Well, it's probably possible.. but highly unlikely).

{"body":"That box you gave will definitely be your best bet. Component video and VGA carry the same exact information in the same exact signals; they are just transmitted differently. Trying to convert any sort of digital video (say HDMI) to VGA requires conversion circuitry for one, and then decryption circuitry; this doesn't take the corresponding loss of quality into effect for repeated conversions. A YPbPr to VGA converter is a simple adder/subtractor, and you can actually put one together for less than $15 if you are proficient with a soldering iron. \n\nComponent video (YPbPr) carries 3 signals:\n\n- The green line carries a black and white version of the picture and the sync signals. If you hooked this line to the composite video input of a TV, you would get the black and white image.\n- The red line carries the difference between the black and white image brightness and the brightness of the red color in the video.\n-  The blue line carries the difference between the black and white image brightness and the brightness of the blue color in the video.\nSending green would be redundant, as it can be figured out from the other 3 via simple subtraction.\n\nVGA on the other hand carries 3 full black and white images, one each for red, green, and blue, and the sync signals are sent separately. This gives the advantage over YPbPr of limitless resolution, but YPbPr can carry the same signal over far fewer wires because no redundant information is sent. To convert between the two, all that is needed to do is add Y and Pr to get red, add Y and Pb to get blue, and then subtract red and blue from Y to get green. The sync is pulled off of Y before the conversion is started, and all of the addition/subtraction is performed in the analog realm, so no conversion or quality loss occurs.\n\nEDIT: as a side note from someone who still uses CRT screens for everything (no, I do not own a single LCD or otherwise), you will actually get exceptional quality, especially for gaming, on a decent CRT. I have used my 360 on a 22\" Mitsubishi Diamondtron for years with a homemade converter, and the picture quality is stunning. The color depth, black levels, and refresh rates are still far better than any LCD you will find out there, even for a pretty average CRT.","subreddit_id":"t5_2rv00","subreddit":"24hoursupport"}

However it would seem more likely that the mobo or PSU is shittified, as usually the POSTing goes *beeo beep* because it can't detect the crispy graphics card.\n\nBurnt smell = anything can be fucked. Usually it's the PSU or mobo or graphics card. If possible, test all of them separately. You can jerryrig a PSU to power up with a piece of wire / anything that's metallic (conductive) and thin, however this does NOT apply actual load to the PSU. I've handled several broken PSUs that start up just fine, but can't deliver anywhere near the promised loads.\n\nIf you don't have the necessary parts or skill to figure out which one's borked, take it to some local PC shop and have them test it for ya.
