{"body":"You sir, hit the nail right on the head. Every point you've made, I was cursing out loud in the theater. Minus the lame mistakes they made with plot (your suggestion about Silva being unnecessarily captured) the main reason this film sucked (and I do think it sucked) was because it completely abandoned everything that Casino and Quantum were trying to accomplish.\n\nThe whole point of the reboot was to turn Bond into the believable, realistic, spy that you would have to be to be as bad ass as he is. Give him a true love, and take her away. What does that do to a person? You have Bond, and all the advice and emotion he gave to the Bond girl in Quantum. That man does not exist in this film. This film is about tribute to the older films.\n\nTribute is fine, but go hire Brosnan and make an alternate story line. Craig's bond is now no different than Moore or Brosnan. Stupid one liners, mild comedy, flashy buildings and the dragons (wtf?). This film just disregarded everything from the last two films. I was so looking forward to finding out who Dominic Greene worked for or how Bond would finally avenge and reconcile the Vesper situation.

It might even be saying \"we're trying to return a bit more to the classic style\". The whole thing with M being a man in the classic office, with Moneypenny outside, the classic Aston Martin, etc really said that just because it's new and a little more \"real\" doesn't mean they intend to make Bond something he isn't.\n\nAt first I thought they were being a bit heavy-handed with the whole \"getting old and irrelevant\" bit, but I think that was simply setting us up for the later events that throw back to the \"classics\". No matter who is playing Bond, what decade he's in, or how gritty vs smooth he is, he's still the same symbol.

The plausible, grim Bond with actual motivations, psychology and action where you feel the danger and risk like in Casino Royale (and QoS) was nowhere to be found.\n\n**A Fraction of my complaints:**\n\nI disliked the movie. Rather a lot. I was bored throughout the entire film. It was a random collection of old, tired, Bond tropes and 'references' that made little sense.\n\nThe action had no meaning within the context of the plot and flowed very poorly. Contrast any of the action that happend in Skyfall with the knife fight in QoS or the machete stairwell fight from CR.\n\nThere was a CGI Komodo dragon. A gaudy set piece that belonged back in the dustbin of Moore's era. That scene came about because we went to Macao *just* so that we could enter a Casino and wear a dinner suit and check a couple boxes off the director's list of \"stuff that Bond should do\". Which leads into the clumsily plotted and scripted. \"Here are three guys Bond is going to fight. Lets say that explicitly in the script. Now he is fighting them. Surprise, he wins, and the dragon we set up to eat someone five minutes earlier eats one. I never saw that coming :|\n\nThe acting was quite competent by all involved. No complaints there.\n\nThe script was abominably filled with *one liners*. The theatre staff will have to scrape the cheese from the projection screen.\n\nHow exactly did Bond survive the fall? He just appears on the coast doing stupid tricks with a scorpion?\n\nAlso, while the plotting was quite stupid, perhaps I did I miss something.\nThe bullet fragments, were implausibly linked to the assassin we meet in Shanghai. Didn't those come from Eve's gun? Did I miss something? Was Eve using a weapon retrieved from the initial assassin?\n\nThe entire bit where Silva gets captured just to go get M in a location he could have got to more easily if he were never captured was terrible.\n\nAlso, speaking of implausible. The Shanghai assassin's job made no sense. Shoot a guy with a sniper rifle from another building when the room is already filled with people you control?\n\nImagine if Bond during the course of the film actually doubted M's intentions and ability to support him in his agent role because of her mixed loyalties or career maneuvering or just cold hearted calculating necessity. There could have been *dramatic conflict* between two principal characters that could have been *resolved* with the development of that relationship. \n\nNo, nothing that interesting happened. But someone did drop a train on him gratuitously. I felt embarrassed for Javier Bardem that he had to act in that scene.\n\nThe finale. Gorgeous pictures of Scotland. Such a huge long yawn-fest.  Did not care for it at all.\n\nI'm done for the moment. Trying to wash that poor experience from my mind.\n\nNO WAIT! Lets introduce a gruff, cranky old caretaker from James youth! Yeah!

{"body":"The main advice I have is to pace yourself.  You might feel great going into your first few 100s, but you will be feeling it quickly.  Make sure you're going at a pace that you can maintain.  Also, the nice thing about this program is that the intervals aren't on time.  In high school we'd swim say, 10 x 50 on 1:00 each.  The faster you went, the more rest time you had, but you also burnt out quickly.  This program has you do 4 x 50 with say, 8 breaths rest.  You can draw out those breaths as long as possible if you want (and I typically do with long, deep breaths haha), but you go on 12.  It help you focus on your breathing too, because when you swim you want to make sure you're not gasping when you're done so that you don't waste those breaths.  The program doesn't say you have to, but I'd do a cooldown at the end too.  I do 100 yards of veryyyyyyy slow swimming in which I focus on getting my technique right (youtube some videos on technique if you're not sure, but otherwise just focus on long strokes, bringing your elbow out at the right angle, etc.) and use it as a chance to relax in the water a little bit after going so hard.\n\nIf you're struggling with the distances listed in week one, try 0 to 700 and start where ever you feel comfortable.  You don't want to start off too hard and hurt yourself or get into a panic (especially since you've had water issues in the past).  It's okay to modify the program as needed.  The main point is to be in the water, getting your heart-rate up! A half hour of hard swimming burns twice as many calories as jogging for half-hour (well, jog/walk is what I'm doing right now.  And that previous statement is based of my RunKeeper, which can track swimming as well, so it might not be entirely accurate). If you need to build up to being able to do 4 100s, that's fine.  I did a week of swimming before the program where I swam 50s and tried to do as many as possible.  I'd throw in a few 100s too, and once I started the program it felt good.  But again, pacing is key.  I do flip-turns, but doing wall turns is fine as well.  Again, whatever you're comfortable with.  Try not to hang on for too long, but if you need to stop, by all means do.  It's a mental thing, similar to running, but it's more dangerous than running in that you're shoving your face in the water lol\n\nAlso- get a swim cap (if you have hair longer than chin-length).  It's a pain in the ass to have your hair in your mouth, under your goggles, etc.  I got one for $2 at my gym, but I know wal-mart, etc. sell them as well for pretty cheap.  Latex are fine.  Silicone ones are nicer in that they go on easier and won't tug at your hair when you take them off, but it was $9 for one at my gym...noooo thanks hahah.\n\n ","subreddit_id":"t5_2utek","subreddit":"0to1mile"}

I asked them to teach me how, they did, and I wound up beating my very lean friend in a race with (what they said was) pretty good form (considering they had taught me how to freestyle in 15 minutes).\n\nI guess the tl;dr version of that would be that I've never been on the swim team or anything, but supposedly I have a knack for it.

Eventually all the expansion will come to a halt, which could be called a freeze. Then after a long long time the universal gravity will begin to pull the objects back towards the universal origin. By this time, hopefully we will have spacecraft capable of sustaining all of humanity.

{"body":"I think I see how this would work.  The delay in I/O is between the server software and the client, not necessarily between in-game servers or other things happening in game.\n\nI can see some players complaining about this happening, but given the constraints of the game and the fact that the DCPU-16 is going to be sluggish anyway, I really don't think it will be that bad of a penalty.  Even adding a response delay of 200 milliseconds would be virtually indistinguishable from real-time input, but would mess up delicate timing in-game for anything that would in theory get some \"assistance\" from an out-of-game computer system.\n\nKeep in mind 200 milliseconds is 20,000 cycles of operations processed on the DCPU-16.  There is a whole lot that can be done in that time which would give somebody relying on the DCPU an advantage over somebody thinking they have an advantage on the outside computers.\n\nCracking encryption couldn't be helped, and if there is some kind of calculation that would normally take a long time to perform (on the order of several seconds, minutes, or even hours on modern computers), I don't see how you could stop that from happening or even trying.\n\nI/O throttling might be useful too, in terms of limiting the exchange to something like 1200 baud.  Again, virtually indistinguishable from what the DCPU is going to be doing anyway without the delay or throttling, but it would keep players from uploading an entire floppy contents without waiting the approximately 3-1/2 hours needed to upload that much data.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

But I don't think it's anything to worry about.\n\nFirstly: The DCPU console seems to automatically have a limit at the rate it can change the screen. I'd imagine it can only set one character per cycle. Therefore, what you are describing wouldn't be faster, because the DCPU would have to spend egregious time printing output to the screen. Overhead adds up.\n\nSecondly: I'm guessing the DCPU can only read one 16 bit word per cycle from the user's controller. It'll still be limited by its own data rates. That in and of it self takes a lot of the bite away from this issue.\n\nThirdly: Network speed will be a factor. There will be slowdown in both directions.\n\nI think the DCPU's natural limits are fundamental enough to prevent worry - there's too much overhead for botting to be a significant issue.

Referring to Table I in the 1995 paper [Minimal Key Lengths for Symmetric Ciphers\nto Provide Adequate Commercial Security](http://www.schneier.com/paper-keylength.pdf) and assuming Moore's law (doubling of computing speed every 18 months), today a minimum of a 62-bit key is required to keep a \"pedestrian hacker with a $400 FPGA\" at bay.\n\nBesides, taking a look at the Blowfish key setup function, there are no conditional branches (i.e.: trivial to port to the GPU). So using an off-the-shelf GPU and writing a bruteforcer isn't out of anyone's budget.

It's the same reason that the idea of holistic radiation randomly ruining floppy disks was [rejected a while back](http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c/comments/11z3y9/floppy_disks_in_space/): the player should not feel inclined to blame the game when something bad happens, no matter how much it might make sense in hard context--threats should be the result of the player taking risks, with clear dangers, and knowing it's their fault when things go wrong. ([Notch has mentioned this when designing Endermen.](http://notch.tumblr.com/post/8208212863/the-psychology-of-the-reticle-and-the-feeling-of))\n\nI'll keep with that example. When Notch created Endermen, the risk established was clear--you knew, once you learned, that if you looked at it, you would have confront a very powerful enemy. You have control over that situation. You decide whether to look at it or not. That's good game design.\n\nYour inertia negator disarms the player, takes control away from them, by creating a constant fear they have no choice but to live with. I would call it a background danger, and these shouldn't be things with massive implications, like destruction of everything you ever loved.

Black and White or Amber or Green.\n\nThe size of monitor will be 64 columns and something between 20 and 24 rows.  It should be enough for editing, programming and daily work.  The abilities of the terminal will be normal characters, highlighted characters, inverse, and highlighted inverse.  For size of the characters I'll propose 10x16 pixels.  It's enough for high quality character display.  The characters could be also put in double with, double height and combination of them.  As in old times.  The character set predefined.  Lets say 256 characters (96 ascii, 32 control, 128 special).  The cursor itself is not an regular character.  Terminal should be able to display one cursor on any position.  Could be as underline or blinking block.\n\nAs for keyboard, the terminal will have two of them.  First one \"build\" into.  Consisting from few special/function keys something like F1-F12 are now on PC.  Keys should be arranged arround the screen.  Maybe on the sides or on bottom and top.  Imagine that the terminal is in some control/machine room.  You only need to see what's happening inside the machine (temperature, presure, another conditions).  And trigger only very few commands like switch between working modes.  The full ascii keyboard attached to little cord is an option.\n\nIf multiple such an terminals could be attached to centrall computer.  Then it could be like in spaceship :).

{"body":"I think that there are several reasons why you would want to accelerate.\n\nFirstly, let's say you've set out from the Sun to Proxima Centauri, and your course should lead you straight to some distant star. Now, the further away the star, the less precisely you know it's position and velocity. You may have thought when you set off from the Sun that you were on a good course, but when you get to Proxima Centauri you find that actually you'll miss it by a wide margin (it wouldn't take much energy either way to miss it). So you would need to either slow down or speed up to correct your course. The same applies to planets to some extent, although if you're close enough to go to them you should be able to find their position pretty well.\n\nThere's also the many body problem, where it's impossible to accurately predict the positions and velocities of all the bodies in an n&gt;2 system (where all the bodies exert a force on each other). You need to do lots of computations for a long time to get an adequate approximation, even if you know the current positions and velocities quite well. Obviously the limitations of the DCPU make this difficult.\n\nThen there's also the issue where if the planets/stars are not in the correct alignment there may be some location you can't get to by unpowered gravity assist.\n\n&gt; Instead the ship would be designed to never slow down (under it's own power), but instead use orbital mechanics to slow down and enter the orbit of the destination, then use the local star as a slingshot to speed up again on the exit.\n\nTwo problems here. Firstly, you have to know when you set off very exactly where every body along the way will be when you reach it (which you can't) in order to exactly get into the orbit of your chosen destination. But then presumably you'd want enter into a stable orbit, in which you'd be gravitationally bound to the planet, and you'd need to accelerate out of it anyhow. (Or at the very least, enter an unstable orbit.)\n\nI think the key thing to remember is that we won't have fuel issues in-game like we do in real life because of the magic fairy dust generator that produces a constant power output. It might turn out to be a lot quicker (especially for interstellar travel) to slingshot, but it wouldn't be necessary. That's kind of important to make an accessible game (IMO) but it doesn't rule out mods where you have to scavenge for fuel (which would also be fun, but would make a VERY difficult game).","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

Or perhaps life spread so thoroughly over those hundred trillion years that it still clings to planets with any sort of habitability. The limited amount of truly habitable stars could be a good thing though, as you are more likely to encounter other players if there are only a limited amount of habitable planets (non-habitable planets could be used for resource mining or really expensive terraforming perhaps). Of course, by 'limited' I mean hundreds of thousands or millions\n\n**resume reading about planet types and resources here**\n\nIf habitable systems do exist and there isn't any tidal locking problems, the amount of worlds you could explore would be incredible in their difference in mineral composition, rotation rates (imagine day and night changing depending on which planet you are on), and many other interesting factors. There could be habitable moons around gas giants and space monoliths left by dying civilizations who knew the end was nigh.\n\nDerelict, trillion year old spaceships could be found in systems abandoned and full of history or loot or terrors or all of the above. You could build your own space station around a black hole if you wanted to, perhaps as a lighthouse to warn others of the nearby danger, or as your pirate base to catch people between a rock and a hard place.\n\nLanding on a world and taming the local wildlife or terraforming it yourself would be amazing, and dealing with the problems of different gravities and atmospheres would be a lot of fun.\n\n/endnerdrant\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"My only issue I can see is the shear volume of data traffic overwhelming a ship's dcpu, which may happen in highly populated areas. I also wouldn't be surprised if some players just constantly send out garbage data to slow down the network.\n\nIt might not be a bad idea to have a configuration so the player can determine what types of packets it wants the ship to relay and drop the rest. Or would that end up using more dcpu cycles?\n\nI'm thinking just about the chat aspect (assuming we have to make our own in game chat system), although this could apply to other uses as well. We're going to need some kind of standard chat protocol for general use. Doesn't mean we can't have additional secure ones for player organizations, but we do need a way to talk to anyone/everyone.\n\nAll chat systems I know of are client/server, but our situation is more peer to peer. I suppose some ships/stations COULD function as irc servers, but if I want to contact an unknown ship I'm not going to know their destination address. So the chat protocol needs a HELLO or HAIL message to do the initial hand shaking. There might be a need for two different types of hails, one the listening ships only return their id, the second returns their id database for relay situations. The chat program should have a setting where the ship automatically responds to hail or requires manual response from the player.\n\nThe protocol might also grow over time as new features are added (group chat, universal translator, etc), but there is no guarantee that the target ship has the most up to date software. It might be better for the end user experience that the chat system silently drops chat packets it doesn't recognize.\n\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

He just made his up, so most in-depth assembly tutorials will be useless (no save/load instructions, no reserved registers, etc).\n\nMy university uses the MIPS instruction set for teaching because it's pretty simple, maybe give that a look over and adapt what it's saying.\n\nYou basically need to learn what registers are, how to save to/read from memory (super easy in DCPU), how to use a stack (push/pop), and how to follow the execution of the code (loops, conditionals, etc).\n\n\n----------------------------\nNow to answer your questions\n----------------------------\n\nA-J are registers. Treat them like variables, yes. Remember you have a limited number.\n\nBracketing is denoting an area in memory, which in a normal computer would be in your RAM. This is basically a giant variable of unlimited size as far as you're concerned. Store your values in here at certain addresses and load them back when you need them later. This is handy for storing variables long-term, as you will quickly run out of registers.\n\nDon't worry about cycles.\n\nPC = Program Counter. It's the line of code that's currently being run. PC = 0 means the first line of code is being run. If you manually change the PC, the CPU will start executing your chosen line of code instead of normally advancing itself by 1.\n\nSP = Stack Pointer. It's pointing to the top of the stack, where you can PUSH and POP values. For the most part, you don't really need to use this.\n\nTo break from a loop, you need to manually set your PC. Notice on his example:\n    IFN I, 0\n    SET PC, loop\n\nIf I is not equal to 0, then the next line of code is executed, which sets the PC back to the location of :loop, which is 3 lines above. If I eventually equals 0, then the SET line will be skipped over and the program will keep running.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}
{"body":"I've done AI programming in a research lab - it's so much less advanced than you would think (and that's not even factoring the extreme hardware limitations of the DCPU).\n\nInstead of \"virtual intelligences\", think \"task automation.\" \n\nFor example: A ship has scanners which it uses to find other ships via their emissions (valuable for pirates). Scanning is a complicated process, including multiple passes, basic noise filtering, etc. Tedious for a normal person, but because the task is repetitious and predictable, it can be performed by a program. Therefore, the pilot would activate the scanning routine, then go work on the generator or something while the ship performs the operation.\n\nAlso, having the ship perform automated evasive maneuvers is possible. In combat, if you want to dodge an enemy's fire, you could tell your ship to perform random dodges in random directions, while orienting the main cannon to keep aiming at the other ship you are fighting. However, you need a pilot to oversee this and make sure the ship is targeting the correct object.\n\nOn the flip side, another interesting area could be weapons targeting (much more complicated but still possible). A ship has guns and sensors detecting nearby targets. If you are in an asteroid field, there are wayyyy too many objects to sort through and determine what is a ship. However, once the target is identified by the pilot, a simple routine could aim the guns not \"at\" the enemy ship, but at the location it should be when the bullet reaches the target, vastly increasing accuracy.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

All you'd need is a nice algorithm, a basic system for whacking it all together.\n\nIndeed, all that would really need to be implemented by Notch would be docking mechanics, and hopefully the physics aren't so complicated that stresses upon docking systems is modelled (and say, ships would be ripped from each other upon high-impulse actions, such as rapidly accelerating). And even if they aren't, all one would need to do would be to have almost a non-combat mode to your swarm-directing software, assuming that the drones are craft capable of travelling as the main ship does (and hence are most likely ships themselves).\n\nWhat I'm interested in seeing is if swarm tactics are utilised on a large scale, although I suspect if the building of a ship is expensive (and assuming it would require an \"entire ship\" and not some lesser craft be built); and if so, what tactics would be used. For example, would the main method be to merely have a large automated wingman? Might another be to send out many, many much smaller, weaker crafts, designed to be shot out, arc around the target and attack other angles/confuse automated guns/so forth? If ships can be built cheaply, will we see *really* little crafts, single-use and deployed en-mass?\n\nOf course, the whole thing opens up a whole other bottle of worms, as any inter-ship communication may be less than secure - Would people goad others into combat with acceptable-loss crafts, in order to gain data on another's system so to mess with communications later? What kinds of encryption will people program, how will people deal with the trade-off between performance and security?

On the bright side space exploration has advanced considerably. Travel to other systems is relatively quick. For some reason or another, you have decided to take a nap in a brand new sleep chamber for a year. Due to an programming oversight, you sleep in your sleep cell for trillions of years instead of only one. The galaxy is now old and dying.\n\n---\n\n * ship:\n\nIn this game you can design your own space ship. You can determine the shape of the outside and then clear out the insides to make rooms and hallways. The game will be pretty scientifically accurate.\n\n---\n\n * gravity:\n\nYou can rotate your ship to simulate gravity. You can purchase gravity generators for producing gravity. Or you can go without gravity.\n\n---\n\n * power:\n\nYou have to manage the power of your generator. Computers, lights, engines, cloaking devices, etc will all use energy. You can save power by turning off your computers, shutting off then engines, and by turning off or dimming the lights. Extra power can be used to charge batteries. Your flashlights and weapons will need batteries. Extra computers can be powered by batteries. Notch predicts batteries will become the primary currency in the game.\n\n---\n\n * multiplayer:\n\nThere is a monthly fee to play online. Team up with your friends in a single ship if you like. Share generators and computers for more efficiency. \n\n---\n\n * computer:\n\nThe game features a computer that behaves just like a real computer. You can use the software it comes with, or you can program your own. You can also buy software from other players. You can get software that helps you destroy incoming missiles better or software that makes your lasers more accurate. You can get AI software for a robotic mining drone to gather minerals for you automatically. There are many possibilities.\n\n---\n\n * gameplay:\n\nThe game is first person. You can move about your ship. Fix the engines. Work on your computers. You can land on an asteroid and walk around and drill into the surface for precious metals.  You can explore planets and board abandoned ships left adrift in space.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

In our 13.75 Gy we've already had several generations of stars and multi-billion solar mass black holes can be found here and there. \n\nUseful energy is removed from circulation:\n\n - Sequestered in black holes\n - Neutrinos. A large chunk of solar energy is carried away in neutrinos. Also produced in huge quantities during supernovas.\n - Photons. For the most part photons don't contribute to formation of future stars.\n - Elements heavier than iron. These can no longer fuse in stars to produce energy.\n\nHere's what wikipedia says about our future past 100 trillion years:\n\n&gt;The universe will become extremely dark after the last star burns out. Even so, there can still be occasional light in the universe. One of the ways the universe can be illuminated is if two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs with a combined mass of more than the Chandrasekhar limit of about 1.4 solar masses happen to merge. The resulting object will then undergo runaway thermonuclear fusion, producing a Type Ia supernova and dispelling the darkness of the Degenerate Era for a few weeks. If the combined mass is not above the Chandrasekhar limit but is larger than the minimum mass to fuse carbon (about 0.9 solar masses), a carbon star could be produced, with a lifetime of around 10^6 (1 million) years. Also, if two helium white dwarfs with a combined mass of at least 0.3 solar masses collide, a helium star may be produced, with a lifetime of a few hundred million years.

{"body":"I am not a huge fan of the Gary Gygax type \"skill levels\" in on-line MMORPG games.  I cite Gary Gygax here as he is the source of most level-based systems used in most modern games as most MMORPG games like World of Warcraft, Runescape, EverQuest, and other similar games are all derived from DikuMud, which is in turn heavily derived from Dungeons &amp; Dragons.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that if you implement a system like skill levels, at least understand where the concept came from, why it was implemented, and what you are trying to accomplish by putting in those skills.\n\nOne of the reasons for the skill level system was introduced into Dungeons and Dragons was to acknowledge that experience and training results in a better ability to accomplish a task of some sort.  More specifically, Gary Gygax was trying to apply this concept to miniature metal figurines, and the \"level\" was really the figures \"rank\" showing that degree of expertise.  Gygax felt that a crusty veteran sergeant was likely more skilled with martial arts than a raw recruit, and that should count for something (and usually did on the battlefield IRL as well for most armies).  The problem is that this concept is being used far beyond what it was originally intended to emulate.\n\nAnother issue with a typical Dungeons &amp; Dragons leveling system is one of the significant side effects of the system.  High level characters (including NPCs) become gods, able to accomplish heroic tasks.  Walking into a room full of hundreds of orcs or goblins can be quickly dispatched in a matter of a couple of minutes by yourself, in spite of the fact that a lowly peasant farmer would be killed in a one on one battle with a single orc.  \n\nIf that is the game design goal, to give that heroic/fantasy feel to the game where you become an untouchable god able to rule over the land you walk upon (except for the other god-like creatures and characters you meet from time to time), perhaps it is a good thing.  Keep in mind that for games like this (heroic fantasy RPGs) there is a tendency for players to start complaining about the end-game because they no longer are challenged by the existing content, thus asking for an eternal escalation of ever tougher creatures.  Gameplay balance becomes a really nasty issue in this situation as the arms race between NPC opponents and the players continues to impossible levels of interaction.\n\nTrying for a fairly realistic game based upon scientific principles sort of throws out the concept gods wandering through the heavens.  My hope with 0x10^c is that people you meet are much more human and show some vulnerabilities to one another.  Much of this is really what type of game Notch wants to make here, but it seems like he is pushing much harder toward user-generated content and more player to player interaction.\n\nOne game contemporary to Dungeons and Dragons that had a skill system that avoided levels and god-like superheros is [RuneQuest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuneQuest)  There was a skill development system, but it was much more gradual and didn't have sudden jumps in skill ability.  If I had to recommend a skill development system that allows players to do thing in the game that they can't really do in real life (like fabricating/welding aluminum hulls for ships or running complex mining equipment), I'd recommend looking at how this game works with skills.  I'm going too long with this wall of text as it is so I won't add more details other than to say \"check it out\".","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

Of course in this case we're talking about many crew members in one spaceship, which indirectly means I'll have access to a reactor array.\nAnd this leads me to one more question: IF one ship can be built and ruled by many players, and if it depends on every single power unit generated from every player's generator, will I be able to command the ship if not every player is online and thus not every generator *should* be working?\nAlso, I know the main rule of any multiplayer game is \"never trust the client\".

{"body":"Levels and skills seem kind of contrary to what everyone is expecting of the game - a big, simulatory open-universe game where you are free to explore, experiment, and survive. Basically, we want the experience to be essentially emergent and unpredictable.\n\nThe nature of levels and skills are such that they condense gameplay into a series of mechanics. They encourage \"builds,\" and place emphasis on particular tactics. As such, they subtly contradict the emergent experience we want, by laying out \"tracks\" of interaction.\n\nAdditionally, as soon as you put in \"abilities,\" you get into the whole headache of skill/class balance, which is just asking for trouble.\n\nPersonally, I don't think the overall idea is bad (give players more complex abilities - the skills - and allow players to become more powerful over time - the levels). I just think making everything item-based would be much more successful. For example, if there would be a \"laser pistol skill\" that allows you to fire a really big blast all at once, Notch could simply make a higher-end gun with that option as a secondary fire.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

The first is incredibly unlikely (since there is no evidence to suggest there are external devices capable of executing tasks on their own without a primary computer to direct it), and the second is unlikely in that you would have to know the device was attached.  Alright, that might work if someone's OS implemented some kind of variant on \"plug-and-play\", but who would do that on a military ship? No, I wouldn't do that, and I would make all devices be known and mapped at boot time, and would passively ignore any devices that attached themselves to the ship.

{"body":"AFAIK DCPU-16 doesn't have FP arithmetics so this won't work, as all FP operations must be done in software. What could work is for example flipping of random bits in memory which Notch is actually considering for exposure to high levels of radiation. The same trick could be applied when CPU is overclocked for some period of time. So when overclocked CPU had it enough and starts to break (or overheat) it would start flipping random bits in memory (which of course include a program region of memory). When the CPU cools down (which also takes time, perhaps more time) it would cease to do this random bit flipping. I believe this could be easily fitted with the current idea (if the radiation levels will also have this effect) and still be fun. It will also pretty much prevent everyone from overclocking all the time.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

There is obviously also the idea of programable bots, giving your code, or wallet a good workout.\n\nAlso, you've not quite understood what i meant, If youve ever play Spacebuild (or a similar game(mode)) you'll understand what i mean, it is very high level simulation, all it consist of is a handful of basic resources, Air, energy, and coolant, with some others (water, ore and hydrogen), but those were the key resources and the only ones which are actually required for play. But even oxygen could be abstracted away with recycling if it is that much of an issue.\n\nJust to explain, your suit is something your player has, it stores the necessary resources to survive. So you don't need to be in a sealed container to survive. your suit essentially fills its self up when it can, wether automatically or manually depends on what you have at hand. \n\nBut as you said, this is a very romanticised view, and undeniably there are plenty of areas that may benefit from streamlining, but i was not proposing a system nearly in depth as you were suggesting.

{"body":"I wouldn't worry.  You see, even though it may be easier to use C++ or some other language of your choosing, remember that the compiler will not always beat a human doing hand optimization, especially on something like the DCPU-16.  With modern architectures, we have things like pipelining and caching that make it difficult to hand optimize code (but compilers are good at working with), but the DCPU-16 has nothing like this.  Remember that the DCPU-16 is running at a very low speed and has very few memory resources available--you want to juice as much out of that as you can.  Certain features of C++ go counter to this.  If you restrict yourself to a certain subset of C++, and fine-tune your compiler, you might be able to generate very decent code with it, possibly on par with an equivalent program hand written in assembly, but the assembly coder still has an advantage: self modifying code.  This will become prevalent in the security aspect of the game.  Things like program obfuscation, exploits, these will all need to be done in assembly.  So don't fret.  Consider languages to be tools in your toolbox, and remember that as with nearly everything in Computer Science, there are tradeoffs for using them.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"But. Uh. Fuck. What. You're missing the whole damn point. There's only one unit. Your discussion of prefixes are secondary to *everything.* And. Uh.\n\n&gt;since there really aren't any different units, just rigid base-10 scaling factors attached to a single base unit.\n\nThat's my point. It works damn well with our number system, because our number system isn't designed for \"3 feet to the yard, each with 12 inches\" and all other kinds of random crap the imperial system has. Maybe if we used base 12. But then there's three feet to the yard! Why not 12 feet, which would make more sense?\n\n&gt;And you can select any base unit and use scientific notation to get the same powers-of-ten function without having to adopt arcane verbal prefixes.\n\nI'll note here, again, that the arcane verbal prefixes are optional. And they aren't difficult to learn. Far easier than all the conversions between all the different imperial units.\n\n&gt;Stick with only feet, for example, and express 1,000,000 miles as 5.28 x 10^9 feet; you've eliminated all possibility of confusion, and maintained the representation of quantitative data in numerical form.\n\nAnd there's part of the rub - In imperial, you have all these conversions to take care of and remember, number of feet in miles and so on. Metric. One unit. Done. Easy. Metres. Derive kilometres, centimetres, nanometres, gigametres as needed. It's all the same thing. No multiplying by 5.28 x 10^3. Just punt zeros around.\n\n&gt;No need to resort to saying things like \"5.28 gigafeet\".\n\nBut 5.28 x 10^9 feet *is* 5.28 gigafeet. You've just said the same thing. giga = 10^9. Why is this a problem? We just have things that we can swap out for every 10^3x scalling factor, to make it easier for Joe Average to say. Fuckin' handy is what it is, but it's not essential. You don't like it? Use the numbers. We all know what you're talking about. Indeed, when it's time to do math, we'll use the numbers as well. But you want me to talk about the power output of the Sun? Please, I'm not going to say \"ten to the power of bluh watts\" every time. I'm just going to say \"prefix watts\", because it's dead fuckin' simple. Nice. Uncomplicated.\n\n&gt;Right, that's it's major weakness. I've seen European ads for furniture where every measurement was a four-digit number because the single base unit - originally defined as a completely arbitrary fraction of the earth's circumference - doesn't fit the practical application very well.\n\nWhat do you want then? A set of units specifically designed for furniture? Perhaps then I should set up one designed for hair straightener specifications? My brother runs a glass-making factory (this is a lie). Should he develop a measurement system for that practical application? Please.\n\nAs someone living in a metric country (Australia), I can assure you that four digit numbers aren't a problem. Why? Because if you're buying furniture and it doesn't matter all that much, you round off. You abstract a little. Or you harden up and start using four digit numbers that are easy to manipulate, because we don't go into 8ths and 16ths and 64ths and such bullshit.\n\nYou don't have to be pedantic as the add is if you don't want to be, in the same way that if a furniture add in the States quoted a length of \"3 feet, 4 and 55/64 inches\" you'd just round the fuck up to 3 feet, 5 inches. But you know what? With metric, it'd be done in a single unit instead of two, which makes the math just that little bit easier when you're working out if your TV will fit if you buy that vase as well.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

So instead of running the physics at 100KHz, you can get away with only, say, 60Hz.\n\nThird, your ship's physical systems simply can't respond at 100KHz.

What Notch is doing with 0x10c -- and did with Minecraft -- can be described as a kind of online community based Participatory Design[1]. Participatory Design (PD) has been a widely used and studied approach to software development for the past 20 years now in the Human-Computer Interaction and Computer Supported Cooperative Work fields. PD is usually practiced through various design methods, all with the main purpose to involve the users in the design process. This serves multiple purposes such as the software designed is made specifically for a specific (work) practice but perhaps most importantly (and here is here is gets interesting from a business perspective as well) the direct involvement of users in the design process results in users taking ownership of the software designed, leading to higher enthusiasm for the software amongst users (this can be broken down into more tangible benefits typically met when implementing new software in e.g. a work practice). \n\nAs a concrete example, look at this subreddit: 3.200+ subscribers, multiple debates, emulators written etc. in about a week -- just because a guy in Sweeden says 'hey - I'm making a space game'. Of cause the success of Minecraft plays the major role in the hype around 0x10c, however Minecraft was build with the same open --- PD like --- approach. And it made millions before it was even out of beta! \n\nI can't cite more scientific papers, as this is quite a new thing but it has cough the interest of the scientific community --- there is a PhD position open for studying this: [Call](http://www3.open.ac.uk/employment/job-details.asp?id=6175)\n\nTL;DR: That would (probably) be stupid --- science says it is a (probably) good idea!\n\n[1]: [Design at Work: Cooperative Design of Computer Systems, Geenbaum &amp; Kyng, 1991](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=574738)","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

If you create new sectors as someone nears or enters it (procedural generation) then there are no bounds. \n\nAs long as you make the size of a Sector at least half that of the data type being used for mats (i.e Double), then doing distance and other calculations near the border of two sectors should be okay as you aren't going to be working near the bounds of your value type space (and we all know doubles get a bit finicky near their min/max bounds).\n\nObviously you will encounter problems where a single sever is going to struggle under the strain of such a large amount of  data to deal with, but if you create a distributed server environment where you have multiple servers managing different sectors that will share / transfer management of sectors (and their connected clients) between them as the load changes, it should be fine. If you can assume that the connection between servers is fast and secure, you also have the server deal with serving up adjacent sectors to clients where the sectors are across different servers.\n\nI actually researched and developed this concept as my thesis topic back at uni.

All that we really know about the gameplay is that it's a spaceship emulator, which means exploring space, mining planets, fighting opponents, etc.\n\nWhat people are excited about is that it's a *really* in-depth spaceship emulator.  Think of all the science-fiction television shows in which the starship crewmembers shout borderline-nonsense regarding the ship's systems, engines, life support, shields, weapons, etc.  This game will require people to take care of all of those systems (and their power management) instead of just manning the guns and directing three-dimensional movement - if you think about it, most space games are little more than souped-up versions of Galaga, and 0x10c is aiming to be something more.\n\nAs for the writing of software and the D-CPU - the D-CPU is an emulated computer that will be used to control your ship inside the game.  The reason people are writing software for it is that right now, it's just a CPU emulator with no operating system (like Windows), no programs (like Word), just something that can do math with bits and change data in memory.  By providing a programmable CPU, Notch is allowing people to have **full control** over all aspects of ship, down to the systems level.  From here, people can write programs to automate their common and/or complicated tasks - for instance, imagine that every time somebody wants to warp to a specific place, they have to calculate the distance between themselves and the destination, calculate how much fuel should be used to get there, allocate a certain amount of power to the engines, calculate appropriate acceleration and deceleration, etc. etc. - well instead of doing all that, they can write a generic warp program that does the work for them, but that takes the specific configuration of their ship (engine, power supply, weight, etc) into account.\n\nSo the question is, why are people getting excited about this?  Well, it's the same type of thing that drives people to design bit calculators in Minecraft or elaborate death traps in Dwarf Fortress - there's a bit of an engineer in everyone, and the engineer in us likes to have time to play too.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

Even the canonical huffman code would be at least 256 words, probably more.

The advantage of short messages is that even if the key is relatively small, you can probably get more than one possible (printable) plaintext out of the ciphertext by bruteforcing.

You should just assume standard disk geometry, non-authentic media and maybe the filename sans extension as the disk name.\n* Compatibility with .org-using code is going to be pretty important, I think.  However, it can do weird things.  For example, the bootloader is .org 0x7000, but is at offset 0 on the disk, which also means it's *not* a file; it's actually part of the filesystem header.\n* Incidentally, the way SSFS Tool handles things is to just take a directory as the root of the disk.  It allows for a single file to be specified as the bootloader.  It also allows for a \"priority list\" to be specified which lists the files to be added to the filesystem *before* other files.  This is handy since the bootloader doesn't bother to search past the first 64 files when looking for KERNEL.SYS.  :)\n\nTrying to see if I can get my current bootloader work running.\n\n**Edit**\n\n* Add an existing file to the project.

I have no idea why.\n\nSo doesn't look like the bootloader is going to be working just yet.\n\nFor context: I tried to get the bootloader source running in DevKit, but DevKit apparently doesn't like local labels, so (since I use a lot of them), I decided to try pre-compiled instead.

There was no bukkit or mods, we had much less cube types to work with, but it WAS a great game since then. Of course, it was an innovative concept (just like 0x10c is), and it took some time and inspiration to drive it to the point the alpha was released. From that milestone, we could observe notch developing features that pleased him most, because this is the way devs are: We ARE more efficient when we develop things we're interested in.\nNotch didn't make Minecraft for the people, he made for himself (at first, at least). So it's more than natural to expect that his efforts were driven by his wish. Of course, after the game gained popularity and he became rich, it was obvious he wouldn't be able to keep up the great demand by himself, so he created a company and structured the game development. Now that the fans are spoiled by the current form Mojang achieved (with Jeb constantly twitting about updates, for instance), they all forgot how it was to play Minecraft in early days.\n\nI can't say for you all, but I surely can for myself when I say I'm relaxed enough about 0x10c development. It can take 2 months or 40 years to release an alpha, but fortunately my taste for gaming experience seems to be very similar to notch's, so as we all know he won't release something he wouldn't play, I know I will like the result when it's finally out. I prefer notch to take years to achieve his first playable release the way he first conceived than to open the development to other Mojang and/or outside members and end up releasing a Space Diablo 3 or something like that.\n\nSaid that, DO GET excited for 0x10c. You all can see how much unofficial material we already have, made by fans. Notch is neither stupid nor arrogant to change his concepts just to break up all the things we created. Just like he did with Bukkit creator, he will probably embody with the game the good things we've made up so far (i.e. disk drivers), unless it really breaks his ideas. So it IS important to have some hype and people working on peripheral gaming interfaces (like DCPU emulators, IDEs, OS, and things like that) in order not only to help notch but ourselves when the game is out!","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

Make the skills tied to a certain action or equipment and the more your character uses that item/action then the better he/she is at it.\n\nFor example: You're carrying a blaster and wearing some kind of heavy reflective armor. If you hit something you get a little exp only for how well you aim your weapon and that specific weapon or weapon type. Perhaps every time you get hit your character gets exp for that armor skill and how well they wear it.

{"body":"It would make more sense if the starting area was on Earth in 1988.  I like the idea of being able to build your ship and make teams before setting out, but I also think that being able to build huge multiplayer ships right at the start might be too OP.  Maybe instead of being able to build a ship as a group, impose a limit of 1 player per ship at the start.  The benefits of being on the same team as someone should mean that you have each other's communication frequencies and that when you make your deep sleep jump and start the real game, you can sync your course, speed, and sleep duration with your teammates.  That way, when you wake up you will wake up at the same time and in the same game instance as your teammates, as well as being reasonably close to each other.  (Within communications range.)  Not too close though, there can be a lot of drift in 200 trillion years.  This way regrouping will be an actual gameplay element, rather than something that's just handed to you at the start.  Maybe, the more massive your ship is, the more off course you'll be.  For the players that don't want to bother with the trouble of searching for each other, you build the smallest, most basic ship possible, regrouping with your teammates will be a trivial task.  it would also introduce game balance because players planning to go it alone can just build a standard sized staring ship, while those in groups will be focusing on making their ships minimalist and sleek.  Also, it will force players who are intent on making mega large ships to use resources gathered in the 0x10c universe rather than with resources given at the start of the game.  \n\nThis could also introduce some interesting strategies.  Imagine starting a new game with 4 other players.  You decide to build a large ship with the intent of making your ship the base of what will become your teams mothership.  Your fellow teammates all build tiny ships with only the most basic of defenses, if any at all. Then you go to sleep and wake up in the same game instance.  Your teammates are just on the edge of your communications range, but the signal is not strong enough for you to understand what they are saying.  You turn on your dcpu and have it display a readout of your radio's signal strength.  You start to fly around in an attempt to figure out what direction the signal gets stronger in.  In the meantime, your teammates manage to regroup with each other in only a couple of minutes in their tiny ships.  They know the best way to find you is to split up so they can cover more ground, but separated from each other, their easy pickings for pirates/griefers.  Even together in a group, they might still be vulnerable if a more well established player happens by.  You know you need to hurry and find your group before they all get picked off one by one so you can provide them with your defences.  Perhaps they are lucky enough to spawn in a mostly uninhabited area and they decide to start scrapping their ships and pooling their resources so they can make a stronger ship.  If another player happens by while construction is underway before you get there to protect them, they will be completely helpless.\n\nAs far as your respawning idea goes, I think Notch already knows what he will be doing to handle player deaths and respawning.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

I remember reading a post about how minor changes in how a few loops were written (as in, the actual *behaviour* didn't change) could lead to huge differences in code and performance.\n\nAgain, in the vast majority of cases (including myself), we're just not smart enough to consider every possible factor that has an impact on runtime performance.  Far better to focus on writing clear, maintainable code and doing profile-guided optimisation *later* than attempting to \"learn how to write fast code\".\n\n---\n\nI don't mean to jump all over you like it probably reads; I've just seen *way* too many students get obsessed with \"efficiency\" when they really have no idea what they're doing.  It's so hard to break them from those bad habits.  I recently marked an assignment that was an unmitigated *disaster* because they got it into their head that \"classes are slow\".  So they ended up writing horrific spaghetti code all stuffed into a single class.  On the other hand, they didn't seem to think doing repeated string comparisons was at all problematic.\n\nThe kicker: the code didn't even work properly.  They focused so much on \"performance\" that they completely failed the assignment.\n\nTo me, someone learning programming from the DCPU is a bit like someone trying to learn English from crossword puzzles.

Not only does it free up the DCPU, it also necessary for people to have a good time. Try explaining inertia tensors to most people, even total nerds, and you lose them pretty quickly.\n\nI expect that the DCPU will be used for coordination, command, and control of a variety of systems with extremely high-level interfaces.\n\nI also expect 'devices' will be artificially compatible. For instance, I can easily imagine that a radar dish hands over fire control vectors in *precisely* the same format that the auto-turret needs to direct and fire.

The only natural objects which come close are stars, and they're actually pretty poor approximations.\n\nIf you're looking for a ship, you're going to be looking for objects that have a temperature around the 300 K mark (the temperature of a warm room) which corresponds to comfortable living conditions (ignoring engines here). Objects at these temperatures emit light in the infrared, so your sensors are going to be infrared cameras scanning around you (for passive sensing, anyway).\n\nSo to hide, you minimise infrared emission and reflection. This means insulating the hull from the inside of the ship (so your cosy temperature doesn't give you away) and absorb incident infrared radiation from nearby stars and planets so that it doesn't reflect away. (Both of these things would need the heat engine/sink set up). Combine this with some traditional radar absorption/deflection and you have Mass Effect's cloaking system. It would be less energy-intensive and doesn't rely on near magical (although probably not impossible) materials.\n\nHowever, \"looking out the window\" is how we've always done astronomy and it reveals a staggering number of objects without infrared cameras or radar.

{"body":"Naaah; hooking'd be slow as all hell.  I can think of two ways of doing this.  Both are evil.\n\n**1**: Once the OS kernel and drivers have loaded up, you mark the region of memory used by the program.  Then, for each process the OS starts, you create a backing file.  Every time you switch processes, you dump the current process' memory to disk and load in the new process'.  Obviously, you wouldn't want to try running the processes *concurrently*; just user-prompted switching between them.\n\nSlow, but would allow you to run any number of processes, only limited by disk space.  One good idea would be to have the linker mark areas of process memory as read-only, so they don't need to be persisted to disk.\n\nWhich reminds me, for some reason, of [Switcher for Mac OS](http://folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=Switcher.txt&amp;sortOrder=Sort%20by%20Date&amp;detail=medium).\n\n**2**: TurboPascal overlays.  The idea here is *genius*, and the OS doesn't need to support it; it's a toolchain thing.  What you do is divide code into one or more overlays which will share the same memory location.  The linker then builds a table in the executable that contains a trampoline for every function in every overlay.  When you compile a call to an overlay function, you call the trampoline.\n\nHere's the trick: by default, the trampoline jumps into a little stub that tells the runtime library \"I need overlay X loaded\".  The runtime library then goes and loads overlay X if it isn't already loaded, then patches the trampolines to jump straight into the method implementation itself.  If a method in a different overlay is needed, it hits a trampoline that says \"I need overlay Y loaded\"; the RTL then unloads X and loads Y.  Ta-da; code swapping.  If you have relocatable code, you could even load multiple overlays in different locations for a kind of MRU list.\n\nThe only hitch is unloading an overlay that's actively in use (as in, on the call stack).  The loader needs to walk the call stack, replacing return addresses into the overlay being unloaded with returns into an appropriate trampoline.\n\nComplex, but pretty damn cool.\n\n**3**: Just thought of this: use **2** with added inter-process communication and some shared memory.  Again, not for concurrency, but memory isolation.\n\nAnyway, just some thoughts.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}
{"body":"Your work is solid.  Good thinking on \"So\", completely agree there, and it sounds more accurate.  \n\nThe message is so heavily distorted, I'm not sure it's every possible to be 100% on exact words, but I'm confident that the message is definitely about the endian-ness.  To me it sounds like an \"oh shit\" conversation on Earth during post-launch of the heroes of 0x10c.  Also, as an engineer who works in endian-ness frequently, low, end, last \"byte\" are all very much interchangeable, so I wouldn't rule on that just yet.\n\nI don't really know if it's one or two people.

Everything is simulated, from life support systems to docking radars.

The DCPU does not have caches, it does not pipeline or execute instructions out of order.  It doesn't have multiple integer units.\n\nYears ago, building lookup tables was The Correct Approach\u2122 when dealing with slow things like sin.

It would certainly serve as an introduction to *low level coding* better than Python could, but that's a separate topic.\n\n.\n\n[1] This does not apply to John Carmacks, Tim Sweenys, etc.  Most programmers do *not* fall into this group.\n\n[2] Note that I, too, do not fall into the category of \"smart enough to make pronouncements on performance\".

I still don't get what your point is here.\n\nI don't think you can get any other precedent for what happened with any other company, where all that happened was a very over zealous fan that knows a fair bit of Java programming and could fill in the missing pieces.  That Notch released the software in a very unconventional fashion is besides the point.  The fact is that all of this software that was being messed around by Herobrine is available through public channels.  If you could point to Blizzard publishing bits and pieces of an upcoming game in multiple public forums and then seeing some fan put those pieces together to make something perhaps usable, it would be the same thing.  I've never known any other game developer even do something like that, much less a dedicated fan piecing the stuff together.\n\nThe only thing that perhaps was over the top on the part of Herobrine was releasing that combined source code in some fashion with a few additional tweaks and then distributing it without permission.  Since Mojang does have an objection to people distributing their software without permission, the concern that Notch might not approve was justified and in fact Notch said \"No\".  that is the end of the discussion.\n\nBTW, the point is still there that anybody could pull together these various sources and put together something of an early snapshot of 0x10^c that roughly approximates what Notch was playing with in the live streaming video.  There is nothing illegal about putting together such public sources, the only thing actually illegal is distributing that collection to somebody else without permission from Mojang.\n\nInstead, the only person besides Notch who has a working copy of 0x10^c right now (at least an early snapshot) is Herobrine.

Backprop can be used to train arbitrary topologies and even recurrent topologies (topologies with memory which have nodes in different places in time).

Space is not defined by the matter that occupies it, though all space has matter in it. As there are an expanding finite number of positions that matter can occupy, space is finite. While space has no boundary, it is still not infinite. This has to do with the expansion rate of space. It is expanding faster than the speed of light (allowed under relativity as it is space moving &amp; not matter) and as such, you cannot get past the expansion. Gravity is currently keeping it under check, but as the galaxies are accelerating, gravity is loosing. The 'magic' answer, is not magic. It's tautological. Dark energy is defined as this force. The dark energy you are arguing against is a variation of this theory that explains this process mathematically. I am in no way defending that model. I am defending my assertion that everything will be torn apart. The acceleration of the redshift is increasing, proving my point. I reiterate, I am not defending the mathematical model you are attacking, but I am defending my assertion that is empirically backed.

{"body":"1-2. You're not necessarily modifying the client, and detection isn't necessary either, just a delay from the servers.\n\n3\\. I'm not trying, I just put this up as an idea.\n\n\n&gt;The only channels needed on the client side are input from the player's controller(s) to the DCPU. That way, it's virtually impossible to have your computer do anything to influence computations - it's a one way transaction, and your machine is in the dark.\n\nI either missed something, or this is exactly how I imagined it's going to work.\n\nSo again, I think you're misunderstanding what problem I'm trying to solve, and how I'm trying to solve that problem.\n\nSay you have a DCPU at frequency 100 kHz. That's not a lot. However, you have a vastly more powerful computer at your disposal right there - it's the computer you're playing 0x10^c on! So you decide to make the DCPU just measure stuff and output it to the console, which you'll be watching in-game, so it will show up on your screen.\nThen, you run a program that automatically makes a screenshot each *x* milliseconds, runs OCR on the image of the console, and extracts the measurements from it, computes what to do, and then sends keypresses back to 0x10^c, where a DCPU will act upon them.\n\nThat way, you're not limited to the 100 kHz of processing power a DCPU provides, because the only thing that the DCPU does is output measurements and act upon some inputs.\n\nThat's not a good thing, as it circumvents the \"rules\" given by the game - namely, the 100 kHz limitation of the DCPU. You're going to have an unfair advantage over someone who spends his time perfecting his algorithms on the DCPU, simply because of the brute processing power you can access.\n\nSo, I proposed a way to stop this - any output to the console, or input from the keyboard will be delayed. If the delay  is big enough, the sequence of DCPU\u2192Console\u2192program\u2192keyboard\u2192DCPU might take too long to be useful, thus making the choice of using only the DCPU better than the alternative of using your desktop computer to do the calculations.\n\nDoes that make sense?

A real crazy proposition that certainly has some interesting implications too.  Maybe just a wild goose chase but at least something else to consider.\n\nStrangely enough, back years ago this was also one of the first computers I ever used... due to a really strange set of personal circumstances involving a Fortune 500 company, the Boy Scouts of America, and being in the right place at the right time.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

The other thing is to have an automated navigation system capable of diverting asteroids, orbiting any celestial body on demand and landing/launching at/from any planet surface, calculating safe speeds to hold ship hull's integrity in a universe that ship hulls can have any form.\nThese could still be lightweight calculations depending on how notch set the physics engine.

You write ASM specific to the DCPU-16 the same way you could write it for a real computer, just with a different set of commands, and that's what people have been doing. Eventually, the programs people are writing will be able to run on in-game computers, and control ship systems, things like that.

{"body":"From the examples we have so far it appears devices will be memory mapped; that you're first idea. This is nice because it's really simple, you can just change the value in memory and it works. However, the big downside to this is address space segmentation. There really need to be standards to make programs work reliably, for example the video ram (output display) that everyone keeps at 0x8000 right now. That's fine for most cases, but what if you want more then 0x8000 words of contiguous memory for your program? You're screwed. Having lots of devices scattered across memory means large chunks are effectively unusable, and having them densely packed makes expanding thing difficult without breaking old programs.\n\nThe other possibility, which notch has said we'll be seeing at least for some things, is message passing. This is just like having a mini-internet in 0x10c, and allows communication between all the different ships. Clearly, having this memory mapped would be bad - you really don't want strangers just writing to your computers memory unprotected. Instead there would instructions that send/receive messages so from/to where ever you choose in memory. We could also use message passing to control the ship by making each control a 'computer' on the network, which when it receives a value adjusts its settings accordingly and can respond. [This is how I think it should be done](http://www.kevinstock.org/2012/04/proposal-for-dcpu-message-passing-io.html).\n\nRegarding functions, that's not actually something you can do in DASM. Calling a function really comes down to changing the 'PC' (program counter - where the computer looks for the next instruction to execute), but since all 0x10000 words of memory are already available, there's nowhere else to change the PC to.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}
{"body":"Wait, maybe I'm not getting the pecularities of the DCPU protocol, but why wouldn't terminal/screen *updates* work? i.e. the server would send only the cells (x,y,value) that have changed (after all, that's how actual terminal shells work afaik)? This assumes that the memory map is itself on the server, but I suppose that it is?\n\nAlso, why would you have to send screen updates @ game tick-rate? Why not e.g. 4 ticks per sec for screen updates (or less)? in any case (i.e. even if this is not applicable to the overall DCPU / game design) I suppose there are things to be learnt from the way actual server / remote shell implementations are/were done.\n\nEdit: oh sorry, it looks like you referred to the possibility of lower screen framerate. Well actual terminals don't (need to) operate at 20Hz, actually 2Hz should be quite sufficient (if not even lower).. and if you *really* need to send the entire current video buffer (but why?), compression is your friend (though, yes, would exert server cpu for multiple shells etc)..","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

The fractions are:\n\nNumber:  BD 45%, WD 55%, NS 0.26%\nMass:   BD 9.7%, WD 88%, NS 2.4%\n\nThe article is also interesting because it takes in consideration the possibility of proton decay in the evolution of the universe! He even analyses white dwarfs powered by proton decay.\n\nBut anyway, as MaunaLoona said, there may be more interesting stars created by the collision of these remnants. This is something the game could probably use to create interesting spots at the map.\n\nIt seems in that period of time one of the most valuable commodities will be small atoms, helium and hydrogen, that can be used to produce energy using fusion. It would be cool if we had fusion reactors in our ships, and went on mining Hydrogen for them!\n\n\n\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

Then allocating an appropriately sized char * array.  Then copying the string across.  Then making a stringstream.  Then writing the char * into the stringstream.  Then using extraction to read out the integer.  You think I'm joking.  *I'm not*.\n\nThen there's all the just plain stupid things that we've repeatedly told them not to do.  Compiling with the wrong compiler.  Using non-standard language features.  Using globals.  Reading files in the wrong format.  Hard-coding filenames.  Reading input from the command-line when the spec calls for standard input.  Writing a friendly menu screen that completely fucks all the testing scripts.  Hard-coding absolute filenames to places on their home computer.  Not writing a makefile.  Writing a makefile that compiles the *previous* assignment.  Hard-coding limits based on the limited test files given which cause the program to fail on larger test files...\n\nThis is why I only ever mark for half the year: it takes me 6 months to recover from the sheer mind-crushing insanity.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I need to go have a lie-down.\n\n---\n\n[1] i.e.:\n\n    while(i&lt;10) {\n      if( i == 0 ) doThingOne;\n      if( i == 1 ) doThingTwo;\n      ...\n      i = i + 1;\n    }\n\nNo, I am *not* kidding.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"As I actually spent many years programming an assortment of 8 and 16-bit computers in the 1980's, I can add some more advice:\n\n* Although assembly has a fearsome reputation, actually as a language it is very very simple. You can learn the instructions in an hour or so. The complexity comes from making simple instructions do complicated things.\n\n* Unlike modern systems, one of the great advantages of a simple CPU is that you will be able to hold all the knowledge of the computer in your head. There is very much a finite amount to learn. This is what can make assembly programming very nice to work with.\n\n* Some things that are looked down upon in most languages are the norm in assembly. Global variables, for one. Self-modifying code, if you feel clever. GOTO, even.\n\nThe biggest problem I find that people have is switching in their minds the 'value' of a register. You need to understand this:\n\nThe memory (RAM) of the computer goes from 0 to 65,535 (or 0x0 to 0xffff in hexadecimal). A register can hold any number from 0 to 65,535. When you use a register, you can use it in 2 ways: you can either use the number inside it as a literal number:\n\n    set a, 3    ;a = 3\n    set b, 5\n    add a, b     ;a = a + b\n\nOr you can use it refer to what is in the memory at that number:\n\n    set a, 2000\n    set [a], 3     ;memory address 2000 has the value 3\n    set b, 4000\n    set [b], 5     ;memory address 4000 has the value 5\n    add [a], [b]   ;memory 2000 = memory 2000 + memory 4000\n    add a, b       ;a = a + b = 2000 + 4000 = 6000\n\nThis 'swapping' of the role of registers is not a hard concept but needs understanding if you are new to programming.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

A better way to handle it would be to limit the interfaces between the DCPU and other controllers, or force all I/O mechanics to all be server side.

{"body":"It was quite a challenge :)\n\nThe independent changes are achieved via interrupts; the upper text field runs in the \"main\" program, and goes into a loop whenever it needs synchronization with the music.  At the same place, the graphics changes are handled; the lyrics data has some special codes scattered around, which, when read, cause an image change.\n\nThe music and credits field (bottom right) are handled separately in the interrupt handler.  The DCPU-16 has a \"clock\", or \"timer\", which can be set up to fire interrupts in fixed intervals.  When an interrupt occurs, the main program is \"interrupted\" and the program jumps to the interrupt handler, which is like a special subroutine.  When it returns, the main program is continued exactly where it was stopped.\n\nThere, in the handler, the musical notes are read one by one and the credits field is scrolled and updated.  Thanks to the clock, this happens very regularly.\n\nAbout the graphics: m4v3r is right.  The standard font map consists of 128 4x8 characters, each of which can be customized.  To display graphics, I overwrote those \"letters\" which I didn't need, like the graph-drawing ones in the low region, and special characters like ~, ?, \", etc.\n\nI had to figure out beforehand how big the images were allowed to be.  I went with 10x6 characters, but the first row is only used by the cake, which only uses 3 characters from that row.  That way, I had to customize 53 characters from the font map for each image.  And only later did I notice that it was quite close; I think I only had 57 free characters to spare :)\n\nThe switches between the images are quick because I create an entire font-map for each of them beforehand.  That way, when I want to switch, I simply remap the font memory, which takes maybe 20 cycles total.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

You could fair play, but most of your enemies won't.\n\nFor example, if the point is having reliable real-time uninterceptable communication among my friends during a battle, I'd probably stick to TeamSpeak.

You then configure lights to listen to that same frequency and if they detect it they will turn on or off. \nThis can also be used during in-ship battles, if that will be added to the game.

Going online and grabbing someone's new code and experimenting with it in game will provide endless hours of entertainment. \n\nBut after reading OP's point, I completely agree this would work so amazingly as an in game system. With any economy based MMO, what you strive for is an economy that is run entirely by the players. You want to add a new gun to your ship? Buy one from somebody who specializes in gathering parts and arranging production of guns. You could go get the parts to make that gun yourself, but it's convenient to just purchase the finished product from somebody else who did the work. \n\nNow realize that with this game, instead of doing manual labor to produce something you can sell to other players, you can write different programs and sell those to people. Somebody needs a navigation system but they don't know how to write the code for it themselves, they can just go purchase a floppy you made for a navigation system instead. \n\nThat all goes out the window once you realize he can just go online and copy/paste the same thing you wanted to sell him in game. \n\nAgain, this still will lead to endless amounts of fun, but imagine how much sweeter it would work as a game mechanic.

I know that Notch is trying to fight two very conflicting design goals here, where one would be to simulate reality as much as he can and the other is to make it as flexible as possible.  He needs to keep things simple enough so the game can actually run with minimal resources.  I suppose that Notch could emulate quantum states of electrons in various raw elements, but you wouldn't be able to play the game at that point.\n\nI suppose that I was hoping to write the router software though, where even the notion of a router would be something that could be called into question.  I guess I'm not comfortable with the idea of simply throwing packets into the ether of a nebulous universal router without having to concern yourself about how those packets are physically traveling around, which is something that was a big issue with network communications in the 1980's.  Making decisions like using a simple broadcast radio for ship to ship communications or using a laser instead seems like it could be important for stuff like this, not to mention having to figure out in-game how to set up the infrastructure of the network.\n\nIt sounds more like Notch is planning on having a \"black box\" that does instant communication throughout the entire universe with something like an [ansible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansible).  The \"network\" would really have no physical layer at all other than this mysterious black box that magically throws data into random boxes across the universe.  While certainly very much science fiction and I suppose it is almost needed given the nature of the game, it would be nice to see the network grow more organically instead.

{"body":"Seconding /r/askscience.\n\nHowever, some quick points:\n\n- A sufficiently small black hole would evaporate fast. However, such a small black hole would be useless for artificial gravity, or anything but power generation really. And this isn't SMAC. The size of black hole you'd want for artificial gravity is ~mountain-sized. Probably several, arranged in a grid, to get a roughly flat field. They'd last millions or billions of years.\n\n- It was a surprise that inertial mass (how hard you need to push something to make it move) and gravitational mass (how hard it pulls on other things) were always equal. Not for larger conglomerates, of course, but for fundamental particles; for all particles, they are always in the same proportion. This certainly isn't true for the other interactions, like say inertia vs. electrical charge. Given that it's a constant, we've arbitrarily set it to 1, for convenience.\n\n- Inertia (and inertial mass) are determined by the strength of a particle's interaction with the higgs-boson field. This is a bit complex, but.. unlike absolutely every other field we've discovered (i.e. the electromagnetic field, the quark field.. I'm taking a rain-check on gravity..) the vacuum expectation value for the higgs boson is not 0. What that means is this: There is a value C, such that if you could measure the average number of higgs bosons in a random bit of vacuum, you'd get C. If there are *more* than C higgs-bosons, they decay to other particles. I'm not sure what would happen if you somehow got less. (And yes, actual physicists, I know that putting it like this is wildly inaccurate. :) )\n\n- To expand on my wildly inaccurate analogy: Because the vacuum expectation value is not zero, moving any particle that interacts with that field through it - which is all particles with mass; \"having mass\" means \"interacting with the higgs-boson field\" - is sort of like wading through molasses. Thus the inertia.\n\n- Despite inertia turning out to have this kind of fine structure, gravity and inertia are *still* linked. That probably means that controlling the higgs-boson field could also let you control gravity. But because the interactions with gravity are so ridiculously weak, we still can't figure out the fine structure of gravity. Maybe in a few hundred years, with planet-sized megastructures built to isolate our experiments.\n\n- Regardless, you can't control the higgs-boson field. So there.\n\n- But if you could, you could perhaps unlink inertial mass from gravitational mass, and move black holes around quickly despite them being absurdly heavy. Yeah, sure.\n\n- And *yes*, there's a possibility that the expectation value being nonzero means we're living in a false vacuum. I wouldn't worry, though. It seems stable enough.\n\nOh, and one way to move a black hole around would be to point an electron cannon at it, charge it, then use electrical fields. That works without touching it. I mean, it's the same way you move everything *else*, but at larger range.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

However, that isn't communication. There's no way you can send a message through that. If you poke your particle and change it, that doesn't cause the other particle to do anything.\n\nIt's like taking two playing cards, one red, one black, shuffling them, and then you and a friend each take one without looking at it.

We know plenty about the universe, from the smallest scales to the largest. We're a long way off still, I don't doubt it, but in every channel of observation currently open to the totality of humanity, we've got tried and tested theories that explain countless phenomena. From electrodynamics, gravity, and the composition of matter, right up to the origins and mechanisms of life, we have brilliant theories correct to every level of reality we are capable of observing.

The theories are designed explain phenomena that have already happened, but can only predict how future phenomena play out. And actually, these predictions have frequently been wrong, and new theories have to be developed, often taking the field in a totally new direction. Great example: Newton's mechanics turned out to be wrong for speeds on order of the speed of light, Einstein came in and reconciled mechanics with electrodynamics/optics (which actually the same thing from a physics point of view) and created the theories of relativity, which have dramatically changed our entire perception of how the universe works on every level.\n\ntl;dr: Science knows lots about events that have already happened, can only make predictions about the future which are often wrong, requiring new theories that can change what we think about the world.

{"body":"What you say makes total sense, however, I am not sure that I said you derp around.  In fact, I have watched your livecasts and have been a Minecraft customer since *early* Alpha, so I know that when you are motivated, you seem to have an attention span like no other.  I watched your live stream this Saturday and was actually surprised at how long you worked before you logged off.  However, being a developer myself, I understand that you definitely have what most of us in the development world have; a bit of Programmer's ADHD.  Exciting new things are what keep us going but regular tasks, such as maintenance and bug fixes burn us out quickly.\n\nSo I am not saying you were lazy with regards to Minecraft.  I am saying that it quickly got to a point where burnout occurred.  I also feel that the sudden success (and events that came from that) could have played as a distraction at some point.  However, this is just an opinion, and you might feel otherwise.  I just feel that during early on and during certain milestones (such as Halloween update) the pace was more rapid and motivation definitely showed through.\n\nWhich is why I bring up flashlights as a feature that could have been so critical for Minecraft and the atmosphere.  I can't think of a more appropriate place for flashlights then the bottom of a dark, lurking ravine.  Flashing forward into an empty vast, only to reveal the face of a creeper, would add an insane intensity to Minecraft.  You have to at least admit that much, right?\n\nBut there is only so much a small team of 1-3 developers can do, especially with a backlog of planned features.  I get that.  Which is why, if you notice some of my other posts, I have been posting things which some people view as cynicism with regards to expectations.  I don't think I am off the mark with regards to conveying what I believe are realistic expectations.  It seems that with regards to these boards, the pendulum seems to swing wildy towards the side of unrealistic expections.  If 0x10c was being developed by a large scale team, with a huge infrastructure in place, I could see the wild eye visions of a MMO game the scale of WoW. However, the real truth is that this *still* is an indie game, developed by a very small team.  So realistically people should take that into account.  I'm not saying you conveyed things this way, but the expectations here on this board are pretty high.\n\nI think it is pretty import to set realistic mindsets.  Sure, it is definitely fun for the board to dream up all kinds of \"what ifs\" and \"do you thinks\".  However, it can backfire.  If the collective boards imagines too great of a scale for the game, they can artificially build up too much hype.  This happened with Minecraft.  Many people called you God and envisioned all kinds of things that Minecraft would be by release.  They really didn't take into account that Mojang is still small, and you are human and can only achieve so much.  So all this hype was built, and when release came, it didn't necessarily have all the features that people believed it would.  Same seemed to happen with Minecon.  Not that it wasn't successful, it was just that peoples' imagination brought their expectations higher than it should.  \n\nSo if I seem overtly negative towards you then I apologize.  If I have insinuated that you are lazy then I apologize again.  I have nothing against you personally or your company.  However, I feel I react to the pendulum nature of this board as well as r/Minecraft.  It swings SO wildly towards the side of \"Mojang can never do wrong and they will create the new WoW!\" I get a little worked up and have to chime in with balancing critisism.  I've worked in the business just as long as you (though I am in different market, SaaS) so I tend to have more realistic expectations to what is possible vs many who truly do not understand the scale of things.  When I say that building an MMO requires a *significant* investment of resources, such as servers and even Ops teams to maintain those servers, people deem that as a knock on Mojang and your abilities.  I don't think it is, rather, I think it is putting realistic expectations towards an indie company, such as Mojang, and its capabilities. \n\nI don't want to knock the fun of dreaming but I just hope the hype machine around here doesn't expand TOO large.  \n\nEdit: To finish, I am glad you reached out and communicated your thoughts to me, even though you didnt need to.  What I can say is that in return I will make sure I do not negatively criticize you or Mojang's capability anymore.  It's not my company, so I have no skin in the game.  It's really not reflective of who I am and pretty much serves no purpose.  Reddit (and internet in general) seem to take out the human aspect of things, so it is easy to get carried away.

{"body":"Um, quite simply you don't know what you're talking about.\n\nIf by 3D Java game you mean LWJGL game (which is what Notch will be using), the graphics programming is equatable to a native code game because it's a native code binding. So the graphics, which defines the \"3D game\" you mention, doesn't actually matter and doesn't suffer from \"Java bloat.\" So, let's ignore \"3D game\" and just focus on \"java game,\" shall we?\n\nThat leaves the actual game logic, which can be made very small with a suitably well-designed OO implementation. An example game I made, [you can play it here.](http://www.minds-eye-games.com/applets/micron-applet.html) Press F11 so see the debug info, and you can watch the used system memory (along with other figures). Even with dozens/hundreds of objects onscreen, all interacting, and GC overhead, it never grows too far above 10-15 MB.\n\nFurthermore, there's a factor you're not considering; until the success of Minecraft, Java wasn't really a high-profile game dev language, and it wasn't used by many professional-level teams. Inefficiencies in game coding can also be attributed to developer inexperience.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"Good point about the RAM, I guess I hadn't realized just how much 65GB was.\n\nI think its tough to say what is really practical now as far as the mass emulation and simulation.  It depends on the budget, how many people are online at the same time, how powerful the processors are, how many people per machine, how the simulation and hardware and communications works, how the actual emulation implementation works, etc.  My gut tells me that the specs that he settled for are going to still turn out to be ambitious and challenging at the present time.  Within 2-5 years that will not be the case.\n\nBut I think that you would really need a working system to be able to make an informed decision.  Even when you had one, tweaking certain aspects of the system or specs of the virtual computer could dramatically change the number of virtual computers you could handle.  What about saving the state of the CPUs to disk?  That might be the biggest bottleneck.\n\nActually I am also wondering about how many of these virtual CPUs you could run on one system.  Say for sake of discussion (it will probably run in the Java VM in a totally different and much slower way) you could assemble directly to x86 code.  Say that each DCPU-16 instruction uses one native cycle.  Say everything runs in one process so there is no switching.  Say for the sake of discussion that you could effectively process 1 billion instructions per second.  Then you could handle 4 billion ships on a computer with 4 CPUs.\n\nOf course its not going to be 1 billion instructions effectively, it has to deal with RAM.  And there are probably going to be a couple or several orders of magnitude of overhead depending on how it is implemented.\n\nProbably to be realistic he will do it in Java, it won't be the most efficient implementation, but the disk will turn out to be the biggest bottleneck anyway, and it will be a farm.  If you could get 732MB/s and just write a stream of data, then you could dump all of a 32GB memory to disk in 30 seconds.\n\nWell, maybe if they do it right none of that will be a bottleneck.  Maybe the bottleneck will be related to networking.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

If the client only has a vague idea of how the game functions and all the physics/computer/other calculations are done server side (Like with League of Legends), you won't have access to that functionality on your client, no matter what packets are sent. Now, someone could theoretically build a server from scratch that emulates what is done on the official one, but if the server side work load is large, it could be akin to remaking all the functionality in the game, which would be a massive undertaking, and would be unlikely to actually replicate the same play experience.\n\nNow if the server is doing little more than connecting the players to each other, and the client is responsible for most of the calculations, making a new server would be much easier , but from what we have heard from notch (like, I believe he has confirmed that all DCPU calculations are done server side), I find this unlikely.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"Forced boarding parties in modern naval battles is unheard of mainly because such a boarding party would need to get through the defenses of a ship first... where any ship attempting to make a forced boarding action would likely be sunk well before it gets close enough to send over the boarding party.   \n\nSuch actions are happening today though in the form of a \"special forces\" action, especially against commercial ships (usually unarmed or only small arms like a rifle or sub-machine gun being available).  Somalian pirates are currently rather famous for employing this kind of tactic on commercial shipping in the Indian Ocean, so to say that a forced boarding battle doesn't take place is also wrong.\n\nStill, thinking about Somalian pirates taking on something like the USS Enterprise (CVN-65) is absolutely absurd as not only will that ship see the boat full of pirates even before they launch into the ocean in the first place, but once they presumably get on board that ship through some insane and incredible miracle they will meet up with all of the sailors who also have arms to repel any such action with a clear chain of command to organize those sailors almost instantly if it happens.  A modern military naval vessel is not a cruise ship.\n\nThis does raise an issue though in terms of military vs. commercial shipping.  A big &amp; slow cargo ship designed to maximize payload/haulage would be very vulnerable to pirate actions, just as container ships are vulnerable in the western Indian Ocean today.  Armed commercial cargo ships with ship to ship weapons is currently unheard of today because the military naval ships generally offer protection against would-be pirates including the threat that the navies of the world will invade and conquer those places that support pirates.  Ships traveling from Toyko to Los Angeles generally don't worry about pirates as the U.S. Navy makes sure they never set up a base of operations in Hawaii or the Aleutian Islands.  That pirates are starting to show up again in other parts of the world here on the Earth says a whole lot about international politics.\n\nI would imagine in the 0x10^c universe that similar highly protected corridors of trade will exist.  As to if future space navies will employ a frigate/battleship model of capital ships (aka Star Trek) or be using carriers with \"cheap\" fighters as a screen (aka Battlestar Galactica) remains to be seen.\n\nI definitely don't see the 18th Century frigate battles with boarding parties happening in space.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}
{"body":"&gt;It could be mostly non-technical. You have a hacking device that shoots hacking rays at your opponent's ship (or something roughly equivalent) and when you succeed you get write access to their ship's memory. This is the easiest to balance from a gameplay perspective (better hacking rays and hacking shields cost more, you can tune the point values of each to get the gameplay you want) but is also the least satisfying.\n\nAny kind of magical \"hack\" device would totally render hacking worthless and totally nonsensical.  Why would hacking be \"dumbed down\" when everything else about the game is so technical and precise? What is the point in writing a secure OS and devices, if my opponent can arbitrarily write data? Do you realize it only takes a single bit to flip for a computer to be rendered useless? Depending which bit you flip, the entire computer could halt.  Magical hacking isn't fun, just arbitrary. Having magical counter-hacking devices wouldn't be fun, just a stupid arms race that would have an immediate predefined outcome.\n\nI think your first and second one are the most likely. However the default code of the game would, I am sure, be updated by interested community members to protect noob players from being instantly destroyed.  So I don't know how long your second point would be relevant.\n\nAlthough your last paragraph is quite interesting.

Multiverse communicator arrays work across the multiverse. Hyperverse commuication arrays lets you talk to real world servers\n\nBy \"game session\" he means \"shard\" or \"server\". By \"multiverse\" he means everyone playing online with a subscription. By the way, a \"multiverse\" would explain the instancing (sharding) of locations in the game.\n\nWords like \"multiverse\" and \"hyperverse\" in the radio names makes me think these radios might operate by using worm holes. If we had the ability to open wormholes through through time and space or something, we could send messages to anyone in any universe pretty much instantly. Wormholes would also allow our ships to travel anywhere instantly, but I don't think our ships will be using wormholes for travel.\n\nHere's where it get's ugly:\n\nI don't think wormholes would be the one big lie, I think the big lie would have to do with the hypersleep device. You must have wondered about why there are programing specs for the hypersleep chamber. Wasn't the sleep chamber just a plot device to get us to the future in a dying universe? Why would it need specs? People have said the sleep chamber is for logging off, but look at some of the error messages for activating the sleep chamber:\n\n&gt;0x0003:  *Not enough fuel*\n&gt;\n&gt;0x0004:  *Gravitational forces too uneven*\n&gt;\n&gt;0x0005:  *Too much angular momentum*\n\nIt seems like the sleep chamber could be intended for use with trans-system travel. Notch has revealed that the hyper sleep chamber will effect the entire ship (becoming invisible to all), so your ship and crew could \"go to sleep\" and disappear and then instantly \"wake up\" and reappear at their destination. The big lie would be that this would cause everyone's timeline to be out of sync with each other. This would be ignored. The sleep chamber specs have an error message that reads, \"Gravitational forces too uneven\". ","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

Mentioned here is something called [MJ12](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majestic_12) a supposed group dealing with aliens and such and apparently they had something to do with [Roswell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roswell_UFO_incident) which as we all know is heavily linked to Area 51 which was also was a clue in the last puzzle. \n\n(As a side note 'montauk' is the codename of the early 0x10c builds but also some project by the [US Government](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montauk_Project) which apparently dealt with some research in time travel which also links with John Titor another clue from the previous puzzle.

MJ12 in Deus Ex is a splinter cell of the illuminati (At this point I'm starting to not think this is the right track but oh well) And not only this but MJ12's base is Area 51 in Deus Ex which once again linking back to previous clues.

If your ship were to do any computation as part of the net, you'd need to have some sort of MPI to let your CPU run that code.. which then would require some form of trust/signature. We might want an interpreted language running inside of DCPU to make this easier. Advantages: having all the ships able to fire simultaneously and take out a single ship with a single synchronized shot. Disadvantages: someone poisoning the net and having the net take out its own ships one by one in single synchronized shots..\n * Swapping trust information on other ships. Is this person's sensor contributions trustworthy? Are they leading us into a black hole here? (More interesting if celestial bodies actually move)\n * Trading scans of ships. It would be interesting to see a black market of \"I just passed a ship carrying some really expensive cargo two sectors back\" type information getting passed around for cred.\n\nOn a slightly different topic, my favorite thought about this game is that the limited amount of memory means that you'll want to have a general-purpose disk of all your basic operations, and then probably a dedicated disk or two for more in-depth handling of specific functions. i.e., one disk that handles navigation/trade/comm, another with just some really sophisticated targeting/tactical maneuvering routines for when you get into battle, etc.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"Think about it in terms of the game world though. The worst a piece of code can do is either slow you down or lock you out. Either of those things may be pointless. \n\nIf there was PvP then backdooring or trojans would both be fun and awesome. Like being sent the frequency of your enemies shield like in that Star Trek episode. Trouble is it would only be \"fun and awesome\" for the person attacking. To the person defending against the attack its griefing and feels broken. Thats not a fun game so it would be wise to disallow it. \n\nThe concept of using a hypervisor must surely come up eventually. The first person to implement that in their OS has won the metagame of producing something functional and safe. \n\nIm not sure if any of this is going to come about. Minecraft has a large following and lots of creativity because there is no barrier to entry; a toddler can create as a well as a design major in game. Assembly is a huge barrier and whilst code wars and backdoors and so on sounds epic in practise it would only be epic to a few people and leave the rest feeling like the game was broken. \n\nEventually security implementations will have to be part of the basic out the box game. Otherwise you are punishing newbies which is the quickest way to destroy your playerbase. Imagine a world where there is malicious code in the wild as soon as you log in; Its only fun if you know its there. \n\nEve Online is like this. Unless you've read up on what to do beforehand its a savage and brutal game that punishes newbies and newbies don't like learning from mistakes. Also it instils a weird culture into the game, as in eve online, which is basically institutionalised bullying of the weak and uninformed. I really hope nobody thinks thats a good game model because its not, you are literally killing off your customer base. \n\nCode wars in space would be an awesome game. Like 3d chess would be an awesome game. Sadly however the average ability of a human being to code or think about chess in 3d today makes both things impossible for a venture. \n\nRemember people play games to have fun. Not to think. If you start punishing people for that you will have lost them. I love my job but I don't want to do it for free in my recreational time. The whole premise of that is what the creative part of the game hangs on. If you incentivise the process maybe that would sort it out but would require a code marketplace. For money. Not warm fuzzies. \n\nIts funny really. That last paragraph was basically the short form of the legendary letter Bill Gates sent to that computing magazine explaining why its better to get people to pay for software rather than assuming you get the OS with the hardware you buy. And he was right like it or not. Paradoxically if you force people to pay for innovation you produce more of it. ","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"I thought more about what your links have in them and what I said, and I now think that stealth is actually more relevant in space than I originally thought.  Space truly is massive, and ships that humans would build would be small.  Sure, you *could* detect the ISS engine emissions from Pluto, but not if you didn't know to look there.  Otherwise they could be anything at all.  Even with powerful telescopes they rely on collecting light for several hours and staring at the same, \"unmoving\" spot for that much time.  \n\nVery simple jamming/decoy techniques would make it difficult to discern enemies at great distances.  Without any idea of how much sensor technology could improve to eliminate background noise from interesting data points (ie, radiation from a planet reflecting sunlight as opposed to a ship's thruster's pointing in the wrong direction), I can only assume that stealth will be the major component of space warfare.\n\nFurthering this point, if you found a way to block all EM radiation from hitting your ship (and therefore making you detectable), you don't need to \"see\" anything.  Submarines do this all the time.  If they don't want to be detected, then they turn everything off, including their own sonar for finding everything around them.  Use stellar maps to plot a known course and go.  Since you can't be found and you already know where you are going, you don't need to see.  I also don't see why you couldn't block all radiation around every part of your ship but a small sensor that passively absorbed incoming EM.  That would still be pretty stealth, again depending on how advanced sensor technology becomes.\n\nI also take back what I said about ships being only large.  I am really stuck on that part. If ships can instantly destroy one another (as I kind of suggested), that would imply ships would instead form loose fleets and act as swarms. The swarm would have several command ships with few personnel (or CnC computers) that would direct the forward, defense, and auxiliary ships around it. This makes it harder to hit any one ship while avoiding having all your eggs in a single basket.  This also means that decoys are easier since your enemy now expects every ship to be small, so drones can more easily mimic their host ships.\n\nHonestly, this article would have been more interesting if  Weuve made some core assumptions (as I did), and then explain how slight variations in technology would shape warfare.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

Perks like \"steady hand\" could reduce random sway when welding or soldering. I don't know if skills, experience or perks are planned for the game, but I would much rather prefer small, subtle upgrades to your character, but meaningful anyway, than say \"10% more armor when using steel armor plating\". Instead of making your equipment feel better (latter example), it should be your character who should feel better (personal skills).\n\nBut again, to give old players an edge, I think there should be end-game materials you can use to craft high-end tools, like welders.

As in, if something can move into that location, then that \"space\" must exist. Space isn't some balloon getting filled up and expanding. It is absolutely infinite, and is not defined by the matter within it.\n\nI do understand theoretical physics. It is all simply guessing. Lets break down this Dark Energy Theory.\n\n- What we observe: Certain galaxies are redshifting.\n- What we can (logically) deduce: Those galaxies are accelerating away from us.\n- Which means: There is a force pulling then in the direction they are accelerating.\n\nThat is the ENTIRETY of what we \"know\". \n\n- What is theoretical and made up: uniform entity, infinitely expanding with uniform density, that exerts an equal force outward on all objects in the universe\n\nThat is all just made up to explain a force we don't understand. How come it doesn't exert any force inward? Why can't it just exist across all of space, and not actually be expanding? etc\n\nSo many questions that poke holes in their guess explanation of what they observe.\n\n- Redshift is NOT proof that dark energy exists.\n- dark energy is a guess attempting to explain redshift.\n\nI am not arguing that the galaxies are accelerating away and redshift increasing, I am arguing against the \"magic\" explanation that has been offered by certain theoretical physicists.

{"body":"That was certainly an interesting article.  Weuve almost seemed like he was dodging questions, but I think really he was trying to get across the point that the interview didn't conclude: He doesn't know how pertinent naval history is to future space combat.\n\nI was disappointed that Weuve didn't take what we currently have for technology and tell us how that would shape current space combat.  For example, we can assume that FTL isn't possible, and that we only have the various *DARs (Light/Radar/IR/Microwave/Ultraviolet/etc), laser/missile for kinetic weaponry, and electronic warfare (computers trying to hack or otherwise hamper enemy computer systems through jamming).  These technologies would certainly be applicable to space, and I would go so far as to say for a good while. Sure, this is a safe assumption because it is what we know now.  One could easily imagine what ships would look like to carry this out.\n\nLogistics: \nWell, you need somewhere to refuel, performance maintenance, re-arm oneself, retire/hire crew, and stock up on necessities.  This would be planets, orbiting stations, moons, satellites, etc.  Logistics is still a thing.  There are such things as Bussard Ram Scoops, so we could imaging ships whose sole purpose was to suck up the gas of space for fuel purposes.\n\nHiding:\nOk, sure, ships give off heat and that may be noticable. But Mass Effect had some interesting ideas in terms of using heat sinks to store waste heat for temporary \"cloaking\".  You could use coated armor that scattered and absorbed various EM across the spectrum, much like Stealth Bombers do.  Also, space is HUGE.  If someone is more than an AU away you would have a hard time finding them if you didn't already know where they were.  Radar would only do so much good, because at 1 AU, like takes about 8mins and 20seconds to travel one way.  Which means you would be waiting nearly 17mins for your RADAR signal to bounce back saying \"HEY, I FOUND SOMEONE 1AU AWAY\"!  In that time a ship could easily move about.  Hiding is actually far easier in space for this reason alone. \n\nIf you are talking about close combat, what about asteroid fields? I feel like that is a great Earth equivalent to hiding. Good luck with your *DAR in an asteroid field.  Even if you did find me, good luck finding a firing solution that doesn't involve a million rocks.\n\nWe can also make the assumption that humans will not make major targeting and navigational decisions.  They would simply make higher level decisions such as \"destroy him\", or such.  I highly doubt they would actually operate \"fighters\" of any kind since the g-forces alone would crush them, or make them useless as fighters. The drones that we have today, while not automated, will very soon be able to automate the process of resolving higher-level goals instead of just unloading ammo onto an enemy as specified by a human operator. This would mean any kind of fighter/bomber combat would be automated.\n\nWe also need to deal with the fact that all space combat would be with energy weapons.  Missiles could far too easily be shot down without some serious shielding.  Today, Boeing 747's are equipped with massive kilowatt lasers capable of burning down any AA missile weaponry.  I don't see why future lasers wouldn't be better. They would fire for shorter periods of time at far higher energies.  Unless missiles can somehow deflect that (which they couldn't unless you knew the frequency of the laser ahead of time and built shielding to reflect that), or used some kind of powered shielding (that could modulate the powered shielding to deflect energy weapons), missiles become useless.  I must admit that traditional mass driver (guns, cannons) weaponry would be somewhat relevant, except that you would need to be close enough that your enemy would have a hard time dodging it, and the projectile would more or less have to be turned into a ball of plasma for energy based PDs to be rendered worthless.  I suppose you could fire back with similarly large chunks of metal, but then you are taking up precious space on an already small spacecraft.  In conclusion, energy weapons are all that is really useful.  But they are limited unless your opponent is locked into an orbit in the gravity well of a planet/star, where their path could be easily predicted. I would go so far as to say that any kind of fighter/bomber would be useless against larger ships with any form of PDs.  fighter/bombers would be better used against unarmed transport vessels, but even those I could see having PDs powered by your favorite power source (most likely fusion, since AM is pretty out there in terms of future).\n\nFor how spacewarfare would differ? Well, if we went with my assumption of fighter/bombers being useless and anything but energy weapons being worthwhile, space warfare would be conducted with large ships of enormous size.  These ships would easily have their own gravity well and could have several defense drones orbiting them acting as mobile PDs, electronic jamming, and communication extras.  These large ships would fight each other from great distances where shots would be fired minutes or more ahead of time instead of seconds.  If ever the case arises that two ships are near each other (within 1light second), I can't imagine the battle would last longer than two minutes.  Time enough to burn out your enemy's engines, communications, etc. Both ships would probably be destroyed.\n\nNow, there are some technologies that would certainly turn all this on its head.  What could they be? Well, the biggest one would be the unifying theory of electricity and gravity (or, as I shall borrow from Isaac Asimov, the electrigravitic force).  This would allow for complete control of gravity by some kind of electronic device.  How could this shape warfare?  Well, all engines would take advantage of this to warp space in front of them to create an artificial gravity well to propel a ship, or create a \"bulge\" behind a ship to push it forward.  You could also use this for deflecting projectiles.  Sensors could be created to detect ships at a distance so long as they had mass.  You could deploy gravity drones that warped space randomly to create decoys.  Really, this kind of technology could be used quite differently depending on how flexible and how easily one could manipulate this force.\n\nShielding.  This one is pretty big and I saved it for later on purpose.  Shielding is a really tough one, and we already kind of have something like it.  However, I feel that it would be more of something you would use *after* your enemy fired on you and you knew what frequency their energy weapons were using.  Then you could fire a laser rotated 180 degrees, which would cancel out the enemy's energy beam.  This of course would require you to blanket an area with your defense laser because otherwise your enemy could fire from a slightly different angle and now they are piercing your defenses again.\n\nOr maybe some kind of bubble that is all too familiar in Sci-Fi games like Sins of a Solar Empire is possible.  This bubble would probably be a powerful magnetic field, much like how Earth has its own magnetosphere.  The problem is this bubble would have to be enormous to cover the ship, and would require an immense amount of power.  It would also be weakest at its source points (like how Earth's poles are weakest).  Not only that, but I already said that energy weapons would be fired in sub-nanosecond pulses and at incredibly high energies.  Any kind of shielding would be worthless against this.\n\nWhat about armor? Well, I am not sure about this.  Maybe if you could develop an armor that could rapidly absorb incredibly high energy pulses and then radiate this energy back out into space (and not inwards towards the crew!), you could have an effective defense.  I don't think this would happen, though.  Since the kind of energies I am talking about are the kind of lasers that are currently used today to ignite fusion reactions in test laboratories.\n\nBut this talks about open space. I think it would be better to assume that all space combat would be had while in a planet's gravity well, since trying to catch up to someone who is several light-minutes away and already accelerated would be exceedingly difficult.  So, if we are talking about fighting above a planet's surface, I am almost certain the planet would ban that out-right.  That kind of warfare would be destructive of all space-based communications and satellites. All that destroyed debris would wreak havoc.  \n\nFTL would ruin everything and mean that all combat is just \"teleporting\" your explosives into their ship. Or FTLing mass weapons into the enemy face.  FTL is so futuristic that commenting on it would be a waste.\n\nTL;DR (because god damn this is the longest post I have ever made, and I mostly lurk). Honestly, I think space combat won't be so romantic.  I think it will be short-lived (if too close), or boring as shots are all called by computers trying to out-guess where the enemy will be and firing well in advance of where they are.  I really like sci-fi, but I think modern technology tells us that it won't be anything like what the shows tell us. ","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

Because it provides a layer of abstraction which is highly unnecessary and creates portability issues (take a look at what is/used to be the clusterfuck of TI-calculator shells/OS/libraries - best example I can give: half the programs use one thing, the other half use the other).  \n  \nAnd please don't say a text editor, or hex dumper, or engine control, or radar system, or what-have-you is part of the OS.

With this in hands, some people created OS, some people created I/O drivers, some people even created what could come to be a storage driver. But all this can become junk from day to night as notch is still unstable regarding the game.\nSo, unless I'm wrong (or missed something), we have few devices (such as LCD display, input, unofficial hard-drive AND a 3D holographic projector) specifications. And again, by specifications we understand instruction set and perhaps some pinnage data.\nDCPU doesn't really exist. It is quite similar to Motorola 68000 (or even Z80 if you consider it emulates 16-bit through 8-bit pairs), with few different instructions. There are some tries to create it using FPGA, and there is one guy who made a robot out of DCPU-16 specification, but it was created by notch.\n- This is not one ARG as we know it. We're just watching a weird case where the game community develops as fast as the game itself (or even faster). In other words, we (as a game community) have more material about the game (including speculations) than notch have ever produced.\n- As our major work is around DCPU-16 instruction set, most of the significant progresses are shown by assembling. As I think you already know, assembling is nothing more than giving nicknames to HEX opcodes, so it's pretty much the same to write \"PUSH\" or \"0x1A\". As there is no official assembler for DCPU-16 and all we have are community-made tools (which translate mnemonics into HEX/BIN codes), the only officially consistent way to make sure your program will do what you want would be to double-check your code through official opcodes guide (as provided in [the specs](http://0x10c.com/doc/dcpu-16.txt)).","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

(These categories would be only as useful as the abilities to which they correspond, so this might be hard to get right.)\n\nConflicts between players could drop loot whose power was related to the closeness and highness of each players' ELO, in order to encourage people to fight peers instead of noob-stomp and to scale item power with total accomplishment.

{"body":"The problem here is that you don't understand why I am saying that it is possible to make a game in DCPU that's more robust than redstone. \n\nIn the end, all of programming is the use of primitives in various combinations to effect a running state. Alan Turing had his tape-based \"processor\" with as few as 6 primitives, if memory serves me right, and that was able to perform various operations. If you gave it the ability to accept changes to it's input to allow for \"player input\", you could have even run games on it, albeit very slowly. \n\nThere's a reason that when we make games, we do so in code rather than in circuitry, and if you understood game development OR programming you would know that. \n\n\nPutting it simply, both redstone and assembly for the DCPU are systems of processing logic. The difference is that circuitry is limited to rebuilding the entire machine every time you want to do something new (It's static) while with a CPU (Emulated or not) you can actually have programs on it (It's plastic, or \"programmable\"). \n\nI make the comparison because it is a valid comparison. If you can make something minecraft-like using as few primatives as circuitry offers, then you can make something MORE minecraft like with greater speed and easier to configure primatives. \n\nYou are so hung up about the difference between circuitry and the DCPU that you fail to understand that my point is that given more complex primitives, given easier control of memory, and given a shorter development cycle (Debugging a program in code is a lot easier than correcting flaws in redstone circuitry) you have greater capability to create robust games.\n\nFor example, in the redstone minecraft game, you only have a single plane of gameplay, and you have only three states that any position on the grid can be on (On, off, and player). With the DCPU, you can have multiple planes of gameplay (Since you now have storage both in the whopping 64K of ram and whatever amount of nonvolatile storage Notch gives the ship, you can store all of that), you can have multiple block type represented by characters, and you can have enemies operating on their own logic.\n\n\nI understand the difference between circuitry and a CPU better than you give me credit for, he problem is that you fail to understand that in the end, they are both just logic operating inside of a virtual environment, and one of them has more capabilities than the other. And my point was that if you can make a simple minecraft-like game in something as simple and unwieldy as redstone, you can do so in an environment like the DCPU even better. \n\n\n\nTL;DR: Yes, it's relevant whether it's easier in one than another, because you were objecting to my statement that if it's possible in something that's NOT robust, it must be possible in something that is MORE robust.

Probably both hardware and software interrupts\n[10:22:53] | &lt;Lord_DeathMatch&gt; | erm... is there any easier way of giving the emulator you released today a program to run, other than copying it into the jar?\n[10:23:16] | &lt;_notch&gt; | yeah, unzip the jar and run it from a directory with a batch file\n[10:23:20] | &lt;shamanas&gt; | thats the most amount of community interaction i have ever seen from a game developer :D\n[10:24:05] | &lt;_notch&gt; | :D\n[10:24:24] | &lt;Jerub&gt; | _notch: it would be nice if your cpu spec explicitly defined what operations are signed and unsigned :)\n[10:24:27] | &lt;_notch&gt; | I would've done more, but I was sooooo deeply in code before, and now I'm kinda busy with other stuff for a few dats\n[10:24:44] | &lt;_notch&gt; | they're all supposed to be unsigned, but with wrap-around\n[10:24:57] | &lt;_notch&gt; | so adding 0xffff is the same as subtracting 1\n[10:25:06] | &lt;_notch&gt; | but I think there are a few bugs in the wraparounding\n[10:25:05] | &lt;hachque&gt; | oh it is the real notch ^_^\n[10:25:37] | &lt;Qata&gt; | hachque: Yeah he just tweeted that he was on here, so there'll be an influx in a second.\n[10:25:53] | &lt;Jerub&gt; | _notch: also, defining your hardware interfaces would be nice. i want to write a testing framework for development\n[10:26:04] | &lt;_notch&gt; | I didn't even mention the server it's on haha\n[10:26:15] | &lt;_notch&gt; | yeah, I will document the hardware stuff\n[10:26:36] | &lt;_notch&gt; | I will also make it all memorymappable in runtime, so you'll have to ask what hardware is connected and map it manually from within the program\n[10:26:51] | &lt;ar&gt; | _notch: btw, why didn't you stick with the 6502 you tried to use before?\n[10:26:53] | &lt;_notch&gt; | as a fun side effect, that will allow you to do double buffering with the monitor\n[10:27:12] | &lt;_notch&gt; | 6502 was too slow to emulate in java because of all the unsigned bytes. java only has signed bytes\n[10:27:37] | &lt;_notch&gt; | I'd LOVE suggestions\n[10:29:26] | &lt;jtauber&gt; | _notch: are you basing the memory mappable hardware off any particular machine from the 70s/80s? (I'm only familiar with how the Apple II did stuff)\n[10:29:45] | &lt;_notch&gt; | well, it's kinda inspired by text mode cga\n[10:30:17] | &lt;hachque&gt; | _notch: did you see Lerc's graphics mode 1 at all?\n[10:30:28] | &lt;_notch&gt; | it's 128 pixels wide for aesthetic reasons (still looks somewhat readable at a distance in the game), and it fits in a 2^n texture.\n[10:30:43] | &lt;_notch&gt; | I saw the game of life stuff\n[10:30:46] | &lt;hachque&gt; | I thought it was a really interesting way of giving more access than just ASCII characters (I'm not familar with CGA to be honest)\n[10:31:06] | &lt;_notch&gt; | I intentionally made it not possible to do full per pixel stuff, haha. I love limitations like that\n[10:31:18] | &lt;_notch&gt; | when the sprites are in, you can cover even more area with unique pixels\n[10:31:42] | &lt;ar&gt; | _notch: also, have you fixed the shaders, where you passed 4 arguments instead of 3 (which kinda works with nvidia drivers, but meh)\n[10:32:23] | &lt;_notch&gt; | No, I haven't worked on making the shaders correct yet. I'm just toying around with the look still\n[10:32:56] | &lt;_notch&gt; | Going to eventually rewrite the cube shadow maps to not use cubemaps, too. those require very modern shader support\n[10:33:10] | &lt;_notch&gt; | Or, well, 1.5 year old.. But that's VERY new on laptops\n[10:33:11] | &lt;hachque&gt; | _notch: maybe I misunderstood the tweet, but did you mention a few days that you wanted to have different versions of the DCPU supporting different hardware features or something like that?\n[10:33:38] | &lt;_notch&gt; | The plan is if I ever update the DCPU, it will be new cpus in the game as well\n[10:33:43] | &lt;_notch&gt; | so old stuff won't change, you'll have to upgrade the cpu\n[10:33:45] | &lt;Rick&gt; | _notch: I believe a few people were wtf'ing at your use of immediate mode + shaders :p\n[10:33:56] | &lt;_notch&gt; | I'm not using immediate mode.\n[10:34:18] | &lt;_notch&gt; | I have my own wrapper that looks like immediate mode, but builds array lists or vbos in the background\n[10:34:31] | &lt;_notch&gt; | so the number of gl calls are very few\n[10:34:36] | &lt;hachque&gt; | _notch that could be one way of offering more fine pixel control without immediately making it available to people; my concern lies with making non-text-based games ;D\n[10:35:03] | &lt;_notch&gt; | the nes also has tiles and sprites, you'll be fine. :)\n[10:35:26] | &lt;Rick&gt; | I think the only limitation atm with tiles is coloring, other than that the system is fine\n[10:36:00] | &lt;_notch&gt; | hah, the spectrum had two colors per tile as well, and nobody complained back then. ;D\n[10:36:02] | &lt;_notch&gt; | (ok, they did)\n[10:37:03] | &lt;jtauber&gt; | _notch: the Apple II had crazy limitations on hi-res colour which made emulation a lot of fun :-0\n[10:37:14] | &lt;Qata&gt; | _notch: Phosphorous green and black? Please say yes.\n[10:37:29] | &lt;jtauber&gt; | with burn in :-)\n[10:37:35] | &lt;Qata&gt; | Aw yeah.\n[10:37:37] | &lt;_notch&gt; | I am considering doing burn in! :D\n[10:37:38] | &lt;Shadikka&gt; | Simulated burn-in &lt;3\n[10:37:39] | &lt;FireFly&gt; | I really like the fact that direct per-pixel access isn't available\n[10:37:45] | &lt;_notch&gt; | but that takes away from the clean polygon look\n[10:37:46] | &lt;jtauber&gt; | _notch: that'd be awesome\n[10:38:20] | &lt;jtauber&gt; | _notch: support different monitors? the cheap ones have burn in?\n[10:38:25] | &lt;hachque&gt; | _notch: random thought, what about making it so that the burn in doesn't smoothly fade away?\n[10:38:59] | &lt;spasm&gt; | _notch: scrap the whole project, people clearly want a burn-in simulator\n[10:50:10] | &lt;_notch&gt; | brb\n[11:02:57] | &lt;STenyaK&gt; | why not create a client that is always connected to 0x10c, offers an API to whichever ship computer you want, and have the client do all the computing much faster than the virtualized DCPU16s in-game?[11:07:20] | \n[11:03:23] | &lt;derinerkan_&gt; | stenyak that is a good idea... but it's kinda cheaty\n[11:03:55] | &lt;Shadikka&gt; | STenyaK: Don't worry, somebody's going to do it very probably. :P\n[11:06:56] | &lt;_notch&gt; | Yeah, you can connect real computers through the game to the dcpu in the game, and there's no way for me to stop that, so I won't even try\n[11:07:17] | &lt;derinerkan&gt; | notch: why not measure speed of inputs?\n[11:07:20] | &lt;_notch&gt; | but it kinda goes against the fun, though\n[11:07:35] | &lt;WillWill56&gt; | Yeah, I was thinking that, sounds like cheating.\n[11:07:38] | &lt;derinerkan&gt; | if a player computes too fast, boot them out of the server?\n[11:07:49] | &lt;_notch&gt; | well, yeah, I guess.. But it's a neverending uphilll battle..\n[11:07:59] | &lt;derinerkan&gt; | i mean, at the speeds a computer runs, a player would destroy a keyboard doing it legitly\n[11:08:03] | &lt;_notch&gt; | if it turns into a problem, we'll start adding checks against it\n[11:08:04] | &lt;Rick&gt; | best counter against offloaders is to provide features that make them not want to offload\n[11:08:43] | &lt;_notch&gt; | well, even if I just stream the video output, people can capture that, then send keyboard commands from their computer\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"I teach digital forensics to law enforcement officers as part of my day job. The classes take them from basic computer competency (using a computer as a lay-person) all the way up to being able to perform many examinations solo. One of the first things covered is the concept of non-decimal numbering systems (primarily hex, a little binary), so that they can understand what it is they're looking at when FTK or some other forensics software is displaying data to them in hex, or when offsets or sector/cluster numbers are displayed in hex.\n\nDeveloping and teaching this material has really made me examine how I pronounce and write hex numbers. It's no longer good enough for me to keep it straight in my head, as I would in my own notes, thoughts, and code. I have to make it consistent and logical enough that a class of 20 students with no prior experience can follow what I'm talking about.\n\nOne of the first mental hurdles for a student to realize, for example, that hex 0x1000 is a very different quantity than decimal 1000. Most people have a solid grasp on how many \"things\" 1000 is, because they can think of it as 100 times the number of fingers on their hands, or some portion of what they get paid in a month. 0x1000 is harder to realize at a glance until you've done some conversion math and get a feel for what base-16 means for the places.\n\nThe quickest way to confuse a student at this stage is to pronounce 0x1000 in terms of a number phrase they already know the quantity of: \"one thousand\". 0x10 pronounced \"ten\", as well. I've quickly learned that I need to avoid this.\n\nMy rules for teaching numbering systems:\n\n* _Always_ prefix with 0x when writing out hex on the board (I still have to explain when some tools don't do this)\n* I only use decimal place words like \"ten\", \"hundred\", \"thousand\", etc. when referring to decimal\n* Pronouncing hexadecimal numbers, I read each digit individually, and prefix or follow by saying \"hex\"\n\nIt drives home the point that the quantities are different, and reduces the amount of ambiguity.\n\nBy this measure, if I were to correctly pronounce the name of the game, I'd read it off as \"one zero to the cee hex\", or \"hex one zero to the cee\" (probably the former). We've had a number of discussions in the lab about the game, and we frequently abbreviate to \"one zero cee\" or \"ten cee\", but honestly I feel wrong saying it like that. \"one zero to the cee\" might be my compromise.\n\nA lot of people coming to the game may be doing so with an interest in learning to program the DCPU-16, with little background in numbering systems. For their sake, I'd advise the more experienced programmers to be very clear with how they discuss numbering systems (even in the game's title!) with them. I'm definitely going to be keeping it in mind.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"I would hope that there would be hardware failures for some equipment simply because it will break down over time.  Some parts of the hardware should \"break\", requiring players to do fault analysis and attempt to figure out what went wrong.  Complex systems with several parts vulnerable to failure would make repairing ships nearly a constant chore in some ways.\n\nThis could be as simple as the \"radiation\" emulators that throw random values into random memory locations over time to a door getting jammed in some manner because the motor fried out and needs to be replaced.  Network traffic can have \"noise\", thus losing packets and other things that are a part of reality sometimes rears its ugly head.\n\nWhile not necessarily \"bugs\", I do see \"faults\" happening from time to time that could indeed be programmed into the game where the hardware doesn't always behave as expected every time.  Notch seems to like the idea of something such as the Millennium Falcon which needs constant attention in order to fly, with lots of duct tape and bailing twine applied in the right places simply in order to function.\n\nIt may be possible to find \"reliable\" components (which could be put into the game as well), but cheap junk should be typical that often breaks down.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"In 1986, IKEA developed their first ever fully assembled product:  The S\u00f6mnen-pod.  It was a very well made product, hence its trillion+ year lifespan.  Rumors are that it was based on alien technology discovered on a disc shaped object that emerged from a glacier in that country's frozen northern region.  However it came to be, it worked very well.  It's occupant was cooled to near absolute zero.  Biological, even atomic processes all but stopped.  And it flawlessly revived the sleeper.  No harm was done to delicate systems, but it did leave  you with the worst case of morning breath ever.\n\nIt was powered by another new device, a small box by an unknown inventor that produced electricity from thorium and rare earth magnets in an unknown way.  It *is* known that if you try to open one, it self destructs.  Luckily, thorium is relatively abundant, being 40 parts per billion in rocky meteors and 6000 parts per billion in crustal planetary rock.  So these 2 devices together could keep a body alive indefinetly, given enough thorium for fuel.  To insure there would be enough fuel, each ship was equipped with very basic mining equipment so that it could find its own fuel in space, if needed.\n\nIn 1988, millions of spacecraft left earth carrying their crew in their S\u00f6mnen-pods.  Unbeknownst to these pilots, jealousy of Sweden's rise as a global superpower, thanks to these technology breakthroughs and their goodwill of sharing it with the entire world, led to a horrible nuclear exchange between NATO and the USSR when it was discovered that astronauts and cosmonauts alike were doomed due to a small software bug in the Swedish microcomputer units that controlled the crafts.  Each side blamed the other with claims of sabotage.  Earth was all but destroyed, and any hope of rescue missions from Earth to fix the faulty DCPU-based spacecraft was lost.  The pilots were fated to their 281 trillion year slumber.\n\nSince all the craft did not launch at the exact same time, virtually every one of them were on a slightly different trajectory.  Being an 18 month journey, the bug revealed itself merely 2/3 of the way through the trip to Mars.  The bug affected other systems as well.  Navigation errors began to creep in exponentially and all the spacecraft lost their way.  They sailed right out of the solar system, through the Oort cloud, and into the galaxy at large.  Some were lost to collisions.  Others had equipment failures and killed their pilots.  Most woke up deep in the Milky Way, drifting, with all stored star charts now hopelessly outdated, unable to get a fix on their location.  Earth might never be found again, but maybe the survivors could begin to band together and make a new civilization.\n\n---Anyway, it really isn't hard to explain things when you're not limited to hard science.

{"body":"Shouldn't be hard.\n\n**Version A**\n\nShortly after the first sleepers woke up, they realised that communication across the vast expanse of space was going to be a problem.  So, they pooled their resources to design a simple, easy to build relay station.  Nothing more than a reactor, some disk drives, some radios and a few DCPUs tied together with string and duct tape, they had it.\n\nDisk drives were, of course, very expensive, but they reasoned that the best use for them would be to enable reliable communication for all.  Very communist of them.\n\nAs the sleepers explored further, they deployed more relays.  By the time you wake up, there's already a sizeable network.\n\n**Version B**\n\nIt would be silly to assume that the sleepers were the first in deep space.  As they explored, they found the remains of a long-since abandoned deep space network of relay stations.  They had apparently all lost contact with one another due to stellar drift, possibly millions of years ago.  Bit rot had emptied them of data and software.  Only the vacuum of space had preserved the hardware itself.\n\nEventually, the sleepers figured out how to restore basic operation to them by gluing a DCPU to the galvanic frammistat port and rapidly flipping the serial port lines on and off.  No one has any idea *why* this works or what those words mean, but it seems to do the job so who cares?\n\nSome tweaking and nudging with a ship gets the relays back into alignment.  Of course, this means that a relay has to be *discovered* before it can be repaired and brought into the network.\n\nOn the plus side, these things have some really sick long-range FTL radios, *huuuge* storage drives and really, really fast processors.  It's such a shame no one has been able to figure out how to replicate or even remove the technology.  Last person who tried?  Vaporised.\n\nOh, I forgot to mention they're all armed and don't take kindly to being poked with a laser stick?  Yeah.  Don't try it.\n\n---\n\nPersonally, I prefer B, but it really depends on what Notch wants to do with the backstory.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

According to the stretch goals the story is going to be very long and well thought out. Keep in mind though it is still basically an intro to the actual game. The universe is more eve style where you will be playing with other people and having an impact on the world around you, which seems to fulfill the freedom aspect of your wants list pretty well, seeing as the end game is essentially a massive sandbox that you can manipulate through your actions.\nFrom a tech standpoint, they are having fully dynamic engines and thrusters, that are damageable. If one of your thrusters gets blown off your maneuverability is directly effected. I cannot tell you how long I have wanted something like this from a game. The thrusters are even dynamically controlled as well, so you don't have to keep all that vector stuff in your head, and the thrusters with simply swivel to get you moving in the right direction while your controls remain relatively simple. As far as I'm concerned this wins it for me in the game play department. But putting that aside, it looks like they are going pretty freelancer/starlancer style with their combat, and those games both had a very good dog fighting style gameplay. Also, as to your mention of the game pad... it's a space game. They also showed flight sticks. Fighter type combat(planes, spaceships, ect..) tends to lend its self to joystick type controls very well. You can't whip a big ship around instantly like you can your character  in an FPS. these things have inertia, and take time to move, which simply feels better with a stick. But this can also be done well with a mouse, freelancer is a great example of this, and seeing as they directly reference that game, I have no doubt they'll make sure it's very mouse accessible as well.\n\nThe main point being, don't be so quick to judge a game you don't know much about, that is still 2 years from release.

Of course I still like to play with mods that mostly negate the need for tedious maintenance - Technic/Tekkit is great for that because with some initial time and effort invested you can totally bypass the decay system.\n\nI can appreciate the idea behind item decay.

The idea that the game might simulate the subsystems down to the point of caring about interference in the cabling gives me a thrill as serious as the one I received when learning that Dwarf Fortress creates depictions of your fort's history on engraved walls.\n\nI don't think it'd even be that hard. Imagine a top-down map of the ship's schematics, with electrical flow represented as blue arrows in the wires, and magnetic fields represented as a heat map surrounding the wires, the strength of which would depend on the wire's age, shielding, current (density of arrows), type of metal used in the hull, and how many inductive loops it does. Many of those parameters could be baked out when you finish designing your ship, perhaps as a sort of \"reticulating splines\" step when you click \"Done\" in the ship-building interface.\n\nWhen your ship encounters interference (a weapon, radiation, ferromagnetic micro-meteorites, etc.), the game could calculate an overlayed radius on the schematic and say, \"These are the wires that will be affected, and this is the magnetic field that will be interrupted.\" The systems connected to these areas could then experience interference...God help you if you connected your life support system to an unshielded, heavily inducted bus! And the first-person perspective of seeing your lights dim and hearing the relays slam on for your emergency lighting would be sinfully atmospheric.\n\nAll of these experiences would be far more pronounced in this game than when, say, the lights go off in Doom 3, because every pilot would have a deep understanding of his own ship's construction and operation.

Running around the ship to manually use the thrusters? Or would you be allowed to use a DCPU with button-mapped thrusters? In the latter case, the system can calculate preferred trajectory and even tell the racer which buttons to press at which time. It could come to a point that it would become a Stepmania/Guitar-Hero/DDR/ITG kind of game, where the racer should just press buttons at the currect timing.\n\nIt would be very hard to balance what would be allowed and what isn't. So allowing a DCPU would mean you be required to just hand out a button/controller-mapped thruster-program. If autopilot programs would be allowed, it would become a programming contest, rather than a race.\n\nThen comes the question of building the ship.

Each layer would then have its own shaped \"cube.\" The bottom layer would all use a deformed \"cube\" that would be slightly (and I mean very slightly, you likely wouldn't be able to tell the difference from one layer to the next) smaller then the next layer up. That way you would only need to design as many cubes as you have layers. This is a little more complicated than replicating a world made up off cubes that are all the same size, but I would imagine it wouldn't be too much more taxing.\n\nAlso, I do realize this is a seperate game than Minecraft, so it will likely will be set up differently, but I love the freedom that it would give you for creating structures on the surfaces of planets. I also don't even know if it would be possible to render all of this in one game, considering there are going to be so many other complex systems running at the same time in game.\n\nTL;DR: I think it would be awesome to have the potential to create amazing things on planets in addition to all these other amazing features.

{"body":"I guess it's really unsure at the moment how the game will be. I can really feel Notch right now. From my perspective I can see two major things why Notch is struggling with 0x10c right now. First one is that he can't just make Minecraft in space. He has to reinvent all the mechanics and make gameplay actually fun. This needs a lot of creative effort and being an indie developer (who mostly create one title and stick to it) it is even harder getting a completly new game going without a team which deals exclusively with such pre-development questions on your own.\n\nThe second big problem I see is the sudden rise of similar games in the space genre. There's Blockade Runner, Faster Than Light or Evochron Mercenary.\n\nAll of them indie titles. All of them dealing with the same aspects of a space game like 0x10c.\n\nThe DCPU clearly sets 0x10c apart from the others but the rest of the game will more or less just have to copy what is already there and people will accuse Notch of being just a copycat.\n\nSo I think those two problems are the biggest ones that Notch has to overcome (including the missing motivation due to them) and until he hasn't managed this, we will not see any further news on this project.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

You've also got links, chains, bluhbluhbluh it's just convoluted, and makes no sense.\n\nMeanwhile, length in the metric system is measured using one thing - the metre. Or meter, in the US. Scale it up or scale it down by a factor of 10, 100, 1000 - It's something very easy to do, given that our number system is base 10, and this scaling allows you to very quickly have a unit at the scale you need, and a unit that can very easily be converted to another unit.\n\nDon't like verbal prefixes? Fine, don't use them. Whack on scientific notation, as it's exactly the same thing, and people who know how to use scientific notation will understand you perfectly. Joe Average might not, and that's where you'd have to go back to prefixes (or probably just one, such as kilo [if dealing with meters on large scales, for example] and get used to writing out a whole bunch of zeros), but if you're concerned about quantitative data, Joe Average probably isn't the person you're talking to.\n\nTL,DR: Metric system has one unit for any given task, and only one.

{"body":"There's still a big question of how it can work gameplay-wise though.\n\n* It could rely on users writing insecure software, that other users then exploit. In practice, this can result in some users (those with lots of experience doing fiddly memory management, or those whose ships computers don't accept string input from untrusted sources) being invulnerable, while others (people running complex software, new programmers) being very vulnerable. It also means that in practice you would probably have to obtain a copy of the ship software of any ship you wanted to hack into, or at least of a vulnerable library it used.\n\n* It could take the form of insecure software provided by the game, either in the form of a buggy default operating system, buggy default drivers, or bugs that allow hardware to be compromised. This would make all users running the stock software, or using vulnerable pieces of hardware, about equally vulnerable. Unfortunately, the bugs would be the same for every ship, so a crack program would only have to be written once. This would make any script kiddie able to hack into a ship, but only those capable of replacing any default code or doing without vulnerable hardware able to secure their ships from such hacking.\n\n* It could be mostly non-technical. You have a hacking device that shoots hacking rays at your opponent's ship (or something roughly equivalent) and when you succeed you get write access to their ship's memory. This is the easiest to balance from a gameplay perspective (better hacking rays and hacking shields cost more, you can tune the point values of each to get the gameplay you want) but is also the least satisfying.\n\nPersonally, I think some combination of all 3 forms would work best. There should be default ship code for bootstrapping (probably including some sort of editor and assembler, and useful example programs for all the hardware). It should have a variety of bugs (the subtler the better, because as soon as a bug is found it will be on the wiki). Users will of course create their own replacement software, which will include bugs of its own that will probably not be on the wiki. And some sort of magic hacking ray that lets you download your opponent's code, or set a certain memory address to a certain value, or mess about with signals to/from hardware, simply by shooting at their ship, would let you be able to find vulnerabilities that exist, and do some amount of \"hacking\" of ships with perfectly secure code.\n\nI also feel that the slower updates, exploits, and bugfixes spread through the game universe, the more fun hacking will be. It's no good if everyone is already running SpaceOS 12 the day after the buffer overflow was found in SpaceOS 11. Information on how to exploit a bug (e.g. send an overly long whatever) should spread faster than the code to do it. The only way I can think of to do this is make file transfer expensive: you should need to acquire software updates over the in-game space radio, or on disk, rather than simply copy-pasting Space Linux from the wiki. How this can be made to work while simultaneously letting developers use version control and letting people learn (which would mostly be accomplished by copy-pasting examples) is left as an exercise for Notch.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

Not only that, but 10 programmers can become 100 or a 1000.\n\nConsider the rate Linux grows today. Its growing at an exponential rate as popularity in the kernel increases. Android is the most successful smart phone OS because of its open and free nature. \n\nProgrammers who create awesome open source software benefit from the repuation gained. In this game, this repuation is valuable if that author sells closed software. Just like its valuable in the real world. \n\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"&gt;Downvoting me because you proposed a bad idea is childish, too.\n\nActually, I'm upvoting you because people need to see why your idea could be just as bad as mine.\n\nI'm sure you understand networking, which means you also understand routing tables and routing protocols. Basically, while a network is in place, each individual node on that network is going to learn about its neighbors and the locations of others and its going to store that information in its routing table, overwriting each entry when a better route is found. If a router receives a packet and can't find a destination for it, it sends it to its default location. However, say we're using RIP (simple protocol, just for argument's sake) and a router has a route that a certain packet needs to be forwarded on. That route is guaranteed to be under 16 hops, because otherwise there wouldn't be a RIP route to it. \n\nNow, combine that with the fact that the internet is hierarchical (think of an IP address as containing information for the country, state, city, and house you're living in, although it's not presented quite that simply). This is an incredibly organized system that sends your messages to your ISPs (at the very top tier of the internet) and then back down directly to your destination. It works with a TTL because you don't have long routes because everything is tightly organized and routers know where their neighbors are.\n\nI appreciate the feedback, but unless you can explain how we might go about doing something like this (routing protocols, and hierarchical addressing) then any arguments relating this to TCP doesn't really stand.

{"body":"This should probably be posted in /r/dcpu16.\n\nI agree that we want something like this.  I've already implemented a device 0 EEPROM in my new emulator and was working on a disk OS that booted somewhat like this.\n\nI actually did the specifics a little differently, though.  Firstly, I didn't copy the boot sector into address 0; I copied it into 0x7000, I think.  This was so that you (hopefully) wouldn't need to move the boot loader itself around.  Less copies = faster.  It was also a nice spot because it allowed \"legacy\" programs to continue to work with the hardware mapped to the old addresses.  It also provided a little extra space for paging in extra sectors for big bootloaders (turns out packing a decent boot loader into one sector is *really* hard :P).  I think I also reserved 0x6000-0x7000 as a heap for the disc bootloader.\n\nSecondly, the ROM bootloader actually checked for a boot sector.  The rule was that the first word of the first sector of the disk *had* to be non-zero.  This allowed it to distinguish between bootable and non-bootable discs.  The first two words were just a jump into the disk's boot loader.  I needed those because it had to jump \"over\" the disc's file system header.\n\nThird, there was a protocol for booting.  I wanted to be able to cleanly boot from more complex operating systems, keeping things like the screen buffer intact.  For example, imagine you have some kind of built-in OS that lets you launch a few basic programs *and* boot another OS from disc.  You don't want the disc bootloader to run around re-searching for stuff and resetting the screen, etc.  So, there was a pre-defined list of values passed on the stack to the disc bootloader which it could use.  The last thing passed was the size of the \"stack block\", allowing for future expansion.\n\nAnother nice feature of this design was that it was possible for the disc bootloader to decide that something had gone wrong (for example, if it couldn't locate the kernel on disc) and then *return* to the previous code.\n\nI can probably dig out my old work-in-progress ROM and disc bootloader if you're interested.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"I already explained PC. PC refers to what the CPU is currently reading. Every time it reads a command, it's incremented so that it can move to the next \"line\" (or however you have your program organized). It starts at 0, and if you don't use any commands to alter it, will keep counting until it reaches the end of RAM. In case you missed this part as well, your entire program gets translated by the assembler into values in RAM, so the CPU can read it when PC gets to them. If you look at the bottom of my post, you'll also see I used \"SET PC\" to change the value of PC for that loop. This sets PC back to the location I need to re-execute, preventing it from getting further into the RAM.\n\nThe others that you mentioned are all connected to SP, or the stack pointer. I'd suggest [reading up on stacks and their usage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type\\)) because I'm not really comfortable with them. But I'll try to explain, and if I'm wrong then someone can correct me:\n\nBasically, SP is always going to point to a spot in the memory, kind of like PC. Except, SP doesn't point to the part of memory that it's going to execute, rather it points to a value that you might need to get. SP values begin at the very end of RAM (the first one being at ffff, and the others going back from there). Onto the three opcodes for them:\n\nPUSH adds a value to the stack. If I use \"SET PUSH, 0x1000\" it will set the next location in SP to \"0x1000\". If you don't use any other commands, and just continue to use PUSH, you'll just continue to set values going back from the end of memory.\n\nPOP I'm less certain of, but I believe it is used to overwrite the top value in the stack and then move SP back a position. For instance, if you use \"SET PUSH, 0x1000\" twice, you'll have two spots in the stack, each equaling 0x1000. Using \"SET POP, 0x0001\" would overwrite the top position with 0x0001, and then move SP back to the first position. **EDIT:** To clarify, I think POP would be used more for retrieving values than setting them. For instance, if you need to retrieve every value in the stack from the top to the bottom, you'd use \"SET A, POP\", \"SET B, POP\" and so on (though probably with a nicer loop)\n\nPEEK is probably the most simple, and is just used to view wherever you currently are in the stack. Unless I'm wrong, this position is always considered the \"top\" of the stack, because using POP technically removes that value from the stack. \"SET X, PEEK\" would set X to this value.\n\nHope that helps!","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

A small digital counter on the side of your hypersleep unit.  The camera zooms in close to this counter, which then turns to **0x10^c**.  This causes the wake-up procedure to start - first a dim light turns on, revealing the player inside, then the lid mechanism cracks open with a hiss.\n\nYou wake up in the small, basic, but 'built to last' ship.  Right now it's only running on backup power (maybe solar etc), so you have to start up the main generator.  Then you can turn on interior lighting and heating.  Then you would check out the DCPU.  There could be software loss due to magnetic decay, which means you have to do an emergency system-restore procedure that will get you some basic programs.\n\nThere is a lot that could be done here.  Perhaps systems would be broken at random, so your first priority might be to fix the lighting, or the fuel system.  You *have* to get certain systems working.  Engines at least, but preferably navigation and communication.\n\nAnother thing would be *where* you wake up.  I'm assuming you would not have access to FTL travel at the beginning of the game (otherwise you wouldn't be in hypersleep in the first place?).  If you were literally at some random place in the universe you would have little chance of surviving, so maybe you would have to wake up in orbit of a star/planet/moon etc.  But heck, there could be different starting options such as easy/quickstart mode and realistic/hardcore mode.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"Routing data on wireless networks with changing topologies has been solved already.\n\nTo directly address this:\n\n&gt; The more technologically advanced of you will probably notice the huge flaw in this idea. Taking into consideration everything I explained, the system would be INCREDIBLY prone to routing loops. Packets would also never die. To solve this, we have the routing daemon check everything but the data of the packet, and store the information about each packet into a temporary table along with a timer. These values will decay over a certain amount of time, but while they are in the table, and packet with identical characteristics (including random value) will be thrown out to enable a kind of split horizon system.\n\nThat's going to eat more memory the more packets you send through it.  Why would you build in that kind of flaw?  That's *why* the TTL value is on the packet in TCP.  Also, what if your routing-loop prevention tables decay before the looped packet gets to them?  This isn't a viable idea.\n\nTime-to-live has absolutely nothing to do with whether the underlying network is changing or not.  It's simply an upper limit on how many hops a packet can take to reach a destination.\n\nI counter-propose two things.  Put a TTL on the packet, and have whatever simulates the transmission of radio waves in this thing to itself decay over a certain distance (or just have a max distance, that'd be fine).\n\nDownvoting me because you proposed a bad idea is childish, too.\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

Easiest I think was the mention someone made recently of the \"sleep cell\" being more like a time accelerator for the whole ship - warping local time to make it seem like the rest of the universe had sped up.

Coders will just provide better solutions, perhaps more automation, navigation, and bells and whistles. Sort of like Minecraft mods.

{"body":"Normally I would agree with you, but I personally think that the same argument you make could be turned around and used on this 16 bit emulated computer VM. Think about it.\n\nThe only use for this computer as I can see it is to control hardware on the ship, right. So, at some basic level where the computer has to communicate with this hardware, there will need to be an interface. A function call or a communication stream that sends a control signal to the hardware.\n\nThe current implementation will need to use tonnes of code that the processor will need to crunch to make that simple signal happen. There will be a basic OS kernel, multiple drivers (keyboard, clock, video, hardware(sensors and controllers)), support libraries, interfaces, and then finally the program itself. All simulated in a VM to send a simple signal.\n\nI believe that all that stuff is unnecessary. Don't simulate a keyboard, just watch for the keyboard input provided through the game. Don't simulate a driver for the display, just send the game engine the data. The game engine is optimized and running right in the hardware, not an emulator. A 16 bit emulator to boot. To send the control signal, all that is necessary is a simple function provided in the scripting language. \n\nPlus, I brought up Google's V8 VM because it compiles JavaScript files down to machine code before running them. So the processing and memory overhead aren't really an issue. It comes down to one VM making direct function calls against another simulating a lot of unnecessary logic and then making the same exact function call.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I like the aspect of adding complexity to the system. But writing software for a space ship is complex enough. Why compound it? Especially when it goes against good game design logic. Every game needs to sacrifice to get clock cycles. All this OS stuff can be done outside the game in any of a number of emulators. Why not just strip away that stuff and leave the stuff that actually deals with space ships and the game?\n\nI would especially like to emphasize that all this work is being done to put an outdated computer into a futuristic space ship. I understand that this decision was most likely made due to real life hardware constraints (CPU and memory). That kind of makes my point though. Games are resource hogs. Emulating a full operating system in a game seems like an unnecessary resource grab. I would rather have more resources for my program logic than waste it on useless drivers and OS code.\n\nAlso, think of the delay. You want a thruster to fire. You send a signal, which gets interpreted by a driver, handled by a kernel, then the program needs to get the signal, apply logic to it, send a control signal and feedback back to the kernel, the feedback is processed by the video driver and sent and the control signal has to pass through whatever system is needed to simulate a connection to the thruster. Cut out the kernel and the drivers. Just have inputs, logic, outputs. So much lighter and faster.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"I think the pricing is interesting, that's all.  Minecraft had a reason for its pricing.  Like I said earlier, if Notch didn't get paid, he wouldn't have been able to continue.\n\nBut now the landscape has changed, so do they need a new pricing model?  Do they need a closed beta?  Or, how about this.  With Minecraft, they offered a free version (classic) and paid version.  Why not make the single player of 0x10c free and multiverse paid?  Seems to me that the reoccurring revenue is more than enough to balance out the \"free to play\" single player offering.  \n\nI am just not sure that the same model can work over and over.  Before it felt like you were funding Mojang's survival...as if you really were an investor.  To balance the risk, Notch offered some sweet deals (free updates for life).  Now, it kind of feels like we are just expected to pre-paying, with so far no deals in sight like with MC, and Notch is already telling us that when he gets tired he will move on.  So we know up front that he is not going to see this one to the end.  \n\nStill, I am going to continue to see Mojang as an indie company.   I will expect their games to have as much polish as you can expect from an indie company.  However, when they start raising base prices with less deals, I probably will think twice before jumping in.  Especially with the monthly fee, that one really bothers me.  A great thing about MC was that I was able to host my own server and share a world with my brother.

{"body":"The analog-correct way to address #2 and #5 would be to draw the frame with the display 'off,' then additively render in (with z-buffering) as many lines as the device could draw in e.g. 1/30th of a second. This effect should loop for the whole fraction of second - i.e., if you can draw 50 lines in 1/30th of a second, a dataset using only 25 lines would be drawn twice in every frame and thus appear twice as bright as a 50-line dataset. If you want to get really fancy then you'd measure the length of each line and draw as much *distance* as the device could draw in that time. A tiny triangle would be brighter than a big triangle.\n\nNow for emulation, you could just additively draw lines and loop through until their combined quantity or distance goes beyond a certain threshold, but that approach is framerate-dependent. What you really want is a queue of lines. Based on the timestep since the last frame, you darken all the lines in the queue by X percent, then overwrite the oldest N number of lines with new ones.

He's talking about making a game that has minecraft-like gameplay. \n\nMaking lo-fi versions of current-generation games is a hobby of some programmers, and when people refer to the game they've made as a \"8-Bit TF2\" or something like that, they don't mean \"I ported TF2 to the NES!\" Woohoo for 8-bit 3D!\"\n\nWould you look at this and say \"DURR THAT'S NOT TEAM FORTRESS 2 HURRR?\"\n\nhttp://i.ytimg.com/vi/fJpTr2nxfJc/0.jpg\n\n\nNo, you understand it's an attempt to make a game that replicates some of the gameplay of TF2 within the limited confines of old tech.

When an outbound hardware interrupt occurs, the CPU quiesces, the device becomes the bus master, and it uses this interface to directly access the CPU's \"memory\" to manipulate registers. When it's done, it can assert an 'interrupt complete' line to tell the CPU to resume normal execution (or, alternately, it could assert a pause line until it's done processing the interrupt).\n\nAs an added bonus, this makes it possible to implement a debugger for a hardware DCPU - just have a way to force the DCPU into a slave state and you can read and write all the registers (and RAM!) that you want.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"Sure are. So now I'm wondering what the previous ones were, before the \u2018more\u2019.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}
{"body":"Well, here's a short version.  C can be considered to be nothing more than a very powerful macro language for assembly, so it has the same ability to use values as references as I explained above.  So, here's an integer variable:\n\n    int x;\n\nHere's a variable that will be used as a memory address, and the value at that address will be interpreted as an integer:\n\n    int* f;\n\nAmpersand is the \"address-of\" operator:\n\n    f = &amp;x;\n\nNow f contains the memory address of x.  We can now change x via f:\n\n    x = 5;\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", x); // x is 5\n    *f = 7;\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", x); // x is 7\n\nFYI, printf(\"%d\\n\", x) would be println(x) if C supported that.\n\nTo remind you, the type of x is \"integer\" and the type of f is \"pointer to integer\" (you could say \"memory address of integer\" but it might not be quite right in all situations, and you'll sound like you're not a C person).  So let's add some more variables and get into it.  Note that I'm starting over:\n\n    int x = 7;\n    int y = 12;\n    int z = -1;\n    \n    int* f = &amp;x;\n    int* g = &amp;y;\n    int* h = &amp;z;\n\n    int** a = &amp;f;\n\nSo now we've got x, y, and z, which are integers, and f, g, and h, which are pointers to those integers.  Now we've got the double-pointer a.  In Windows, a pointer to a pointer is called a handle.  I could get into why handles are useful, but I don't have time today.\n\nWith this in place, we can do fun stuff like making h also point to x, instead of z, without mentioning h or z:\n\n    *a = &amp;x;\n\nI'm not coming up with much else in terms of pointer juggling, but you can do pretty much anything you could imagine.  Pointer arithmetic, however, gets interesting.  Let's assume that x, y, and z are adjacent in the compiled code.  It's an unsafe assumption, but not an unreasonable one.  What should this produce?\n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", *(f + 1));\n\nThe answer is 12.  So *(f + 1) refers to the value at the memory address after x, which is y in this case.  I'll post more later, but I have to go.  Feel free to ask questions.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"You know why I make a big deal of nonstandard hardware, and nonstandard assembly, and why I get involved in the direction of popular projects?\n\nBecause the decisions they make affect the entire community. If a major project like DevKit or the toolchain makes a decision that I don't like, I'm going to be forced to either adopt it or start accepting incompatibility between major projects. I don't want to divide the community into \"devkit\" and \"toolchain\" and \"organic+lettuce\". I truly want people to be able to share code between all of the above without struggle. So I make a big deal about it when someone makes a bad decision, because it doesn't just affect them.\n\nThink about the broader reach of what you do. DevKit has bloody HTTP hardware, for goodness sakes. I dislike DevKit so much because it makes all the wrong decisions, and does so from an esteemed position on the ladder of 0x10c projects. You've added so much stuff to DevKit that doesn't belong, despite several people telling you that you shouldn't, and it's very difficult for me to watch that affect the entire community.\n\nSo yes, I make a stand when popular projects are doing things I don't agree with, because it inevitably affects me.

This way you wouldn't need multiple crew, but if you and a bunch of friends are on line you have the capacity to play together.\n\nPeople in smaller ships could offer VIP transport through dangerous sections thanks to their cloaking or speed etc. It's that open ended part I really hope this game will achieve.\n\nHas it been confirmed anywhere that multi crew ships are actually a possibility?","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"As I said in the other thread, I think the hacking will come in different ways.\n\n* First, OS/Software developers could leave intended backdoors for their own hacking throughout the universe. If I could make an OS and I was intending to have control, I could hide among the code some instructions that would allow ME to take control whenever I saw a ship using my OS and, say, a RF communication. This could be done by the OS developer OR by the compiler developer (as op stated), but the effects would be the same.\n\n* Second, there are devices. And I believe there will be new devices from time to time. Those devices will communicate with DCPU in a fashion, and there could be security issues within this communication, which a hacker could take advantage from.\n\n* Third, a hacker with physical access to your ship could make himself his beacon and install in your system. This could be from a simple keylogger to an external control override.\n\n* And last I can think is to provide some kind of virus, any kind of malicious software that would run silently among the DCPU processes and send sensitive data to the creator through the network (or even save a logfile to be retrieved later by physical access).\n\nSaid that, I think the only safe way to be backdoor-free is to create your own OS through your own compiler and make your own software.

We want to create ships (using 2 accounts together if necessary) with something like a symbiotic parasite-like relationship if we can.\n\nFor example, one ship with all of it's reactor power dedicated to raw computing. Just a box with computers. And a second ship dedicated to just propulsion, avionics, and weapons. Hopefully, either with docking connectors or ship geometry, we'd can get them to link together physically.\n\nOur end vision for this is basically hive ships, where you get a small community of players to merge their ships together, each performing a specific (or redundant) role.\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"Access to all hardware is via HWI (see also HWN/HWQ).  Any program accessing hardware must:\n\n1. Determine the hardware index for desired hardware (by probing HWQ and matching device ID).\n1. Using that index, invoking HWI after setting registers per the docs for that hardware.\n\nThe screen is handled similarly.  There are no opcodes specific to screen operations.  However, the instruction set is sufficiently versatile to setup DMA (Direct Memory Access -- the mechanism simulated here to transfer the screen), and write to that memory.  To set that up HWI is used.\n\nDrives (as well as real drives) are actually far more primitive than you're probably thinking.  Physical drives work in sectors (and sometimes even more low-level than that), which contain some small number of bytes.  It is up to the software to manage how sectors are organized into files, or not to bother and just use sectors to organize data in some other means (flat, indexed, etc).\n\nFile storage is only one way or many to organize storage.  0x10c has not standardized (perhaps intentionally) on the means of storing or managing that data, leaving it right now to the community to decide on popular standards.  Inconsistencies are likely intentional, just as they were back in the 80's -- the same floppy disk could be formatted different ways and different machines would often not be able to use the same disc.\n\nI think you may want to play with one of the current OS's: 0x42, dcpuos, etc. as those may provide file system support.  However, there is no reason a DCPU couldn't be used very well as a single-purpose device without any file system at all.  The question of how the ROM (or boot ROM) gets there is right now just another unknown that Notch still needs to answer when he's ready.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

The same programs I've written in C will probably be possible to compile for dcpu-16 so does that mean I should post all the programs I make for C?\n\nThis is what I see your submission as, a platform independent program that could be ran in 0x10^c .","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

I understand that C and C++ were around at that time (c since 1972 and C++ since 1983) but the fact is they were NOT used on space crafts at the time. The the common manned launch vehicle at the time was the space shuttle. It was programmed in HAL/S. Just so your aware, the acceptable space launch computers are at least 5 years old. The reason is that all of the equipment must be tested in high noise environments. In space there is no magnetosphere to protect the electronics for cosmic radiation, also higher transistor density means that it is more likely that a transistor is saturated by radiation and you get corrupt data. This leaves us at the point were according to history, science, and game background the only logical high level programming language is HAL/S.\n\nIf you want to mod it on your server that is completely cool. but i doubt very seriously that it will get incorporated globally.\n\nFor your sanity, you can compile c down to assembly, if you know the architecture of the computer. so someone will write a c compiler for this and you can copy paste your c code into the machine.\n\nHope I don't sound like a hater but please think before you make stupid comments like \"assembly is pointless\"","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

However, every kernel has a different application format, and kernels may want to support different application formats (such as allowing shared libraries to be built).\n\nA linker script (or policy as it is known in the toolchain) allows kernel developers to specify the file shown under the \"DEFINING THE POLICY\" section.  That policy, along with the kernel's jumplist is shipped along side the toolchain and when it comes time to link the final application together, users can link against any given kernel with a command as simple as:\n\ndtld -k atlasos -o file.dcpu16 file.dobj16\n\nwhich indicates that the binary should be built for AtlasOS.

No. Don't know what you're on about really.\n\nI'm going on the assumption of the basis of what Notch has provided, and you can clearly see he wants the DCPU computers to be a integral point of gameplay.\n\nI've said earlier I agree with the points OP has made, I'm not insulting anyone, I didn't insult you either. I don't know where you come across that, is it the:\n\n&gt;Hmm, I don't like the power limit in the game, I want to cloak and fire my weapons at the same time! NOTCH, CAN I HAVE NO POWER LIMIT IN ONLINE PLAY PLEASE?!?\n\nBecause I wasn't even addressing you, just the general folk with that mindset, unless you associate yourself with that.\n\nThere was no intent of insult, but if you take it that way, that's your issue. I haven't insulted anyone.\n\nThe fact is that Notch wants the systems to be an integral part of ship, not using it will be creative, but will render you less useful by a large margin. And since this won't be private servers, but a multiverse, people will fall into the norm like every other MMO game out there.\n\n&gt;I don't see why being able to shoot a missile out of a tube and praying it will hit something should not be allowed in the game as well.\n\nPerhaps you missed the point that Notch wants this game to be hard scifi.\n\nI never said it's bad, but this will all take place on a server where everyone plays. If you don't want to use computers at all, that's fine. But the fact is it undermines the point of systems, as the first discussion pointed out. And you can't deny that. It's creative, but the computers are a foundation for the ship, it's part of the game, not using it is undermining that point. \n\nI never said it's not creative, why you would use no systems would make you less useful, less strong, less optimum. That's my point. So being creative in the expense of having an optimum ship makes no sense in a game like this at all. The whole point of ships is the hard scifi and having an optimum ship. Even as a mining barge, you'd want to use computers for optimum efficiency, not using it will do what? Make you less effective, and then whats the point? Have you played this genre of game before? The point is not to be more creative and make you less effective - this is space, it's rogue, anything can happen, being less effective but more 'creative' won't make you better. It's like flying around in nullsec in EVE with a rookie ship that's not as effective as a better grade ship but it's more 'creative' because you are not using the most optimum modules/ships for roaming nullse. That's not the point of a game.\n\nIf you think optimum efficiency of your ship is a good expense for being creative, then perhaps this isn't the game for you or anyone with that mindset since they just simply won't survive in the game unless they just focus on scamming or playing the market. And that's not an insult, just stating that in advance especially for you.\n\nBut whatever, I doubt Notch will write additional features for a ship with zero dependency on computer systems because he wants a hard scifi game, he said so himself. It can change, but whatever. It's not the point of the game.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

When you program in assembler, you will understand how huge this deficit actually is - I mean it's fucking huge.

You put things ontop of the stack, or pick up the top one with ease. You can also easily see what is currently on top.

Referring to Table I in the 1995 paper Minimal Key Lengths for Symmetric Ciphers to Provide Adequate Commercial Security and assuming Moore's law (doubling of computing speed every 18 months), today a minimum of a 62-bit key is required to keep a \"pedestrian hacker with a $400 FPGA\" at bay.\n\n\nThis is wrong. In addition, that is not how Moore's Law works. Moore's law says nothing about computing power or speed, but price and availability of transistors. In addition, while FPGAs have advanced their price remains relatively unchanged and will still take at least several thousand dollars in hardware, not counting to create the custom code required. If you want more info on this topic, the EFF actually did crack 56bit DES keys http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFF_DES_cracker\n\nIn addition the current iteration of the EFF Des cracker lineage http://www.copacobana.org/faq.html requires 120 $500 FPGAs.

{"body":"I have mixed feelings about this.  I have experience programming and I want to be rewarded in the game for writing some code of my own. But at the same time it would be kind of a silly game if knowledge of assembly programming was required to play it correctly.  And I'm sure there will be times when I really don't feel like writing code to make things happen in the ship.  I guess I'm hoping for some kind of compromise.

{"body":"It's the dealer/druggie mentality.  No matter how right I am, they will always be afraid to agree.  Afraid to offend Notch because he can take their fix away.  \n\nLittle do they realize, he isn't offering anything.  All of this is in their heads.  There is no game.\n\nThis whole subreddit is just ideas.  They are manifesting this \"idea\" of a game that will never be.  0x10c might be released but it will be NO WHERE CLOSE to what they are hoping it will be.\n\nSo what are we left with?  A game where the community is more passionate about it then the creator.  He is losing focus people.  Whether it is Diablo 3, Santa vs Cthulu, FPS challenge:  All those trump 0x10c.  You care more about this game than he does.  \n\nThen, when someone from the community actually attempts to release a \"taste\" of this concept of a game, Notch *finally* takes some kind of action.  He finally steps in and blocks that from happening, because his Ego decided that HE should be the one to release the demo.  So he makes all this effort to block it from being released, then instead of focusing on giving the community what they want (the demo) he decides to switch gears to make a FPS.  Why block it in the first place if you never intended to release it on your own?  \n\nAgain, one true answer:  Ego.  This game, is about him.  Not Markus....no he is NOTCH now.  Everything goes his way because he is \"God\".  This is not about the community.  They are only there to praise him.  They can't contribute and they can't participate.  They can only watch.\n\nUnfortunate, really.  The sad reality IS that the community truly cares more about this game than Notch.  All he cares about is control and ego.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

More generally, almost every system that had a y2k problem was a result of using separate counters for different divisions of time, with too few bits in the year field. \n\nUnix time is far from the only common timestamp format, and even if you keep just one monotonic counter, the resolution could be seconds, sixtieths of a second (the original Unix time), nanoseconds, or something else.\n\nThe only plot hole is why four words were used for the year field.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"I have one [Minecraft ](http://www.minecraft.net)[IC\u00b2](http://wiki.industrial-craft.net) server, where I made one huge array of [MFSU](http://wiki.industrial-craft.net/index.php?title=MFS_Unit) (32 if I'm not mistaken) connected to the output of my nuclear power plant, which has 10 [6-chamber](http://wiki.industrial-craft.net/index.php?title=Reactor_Chamber) [nuclear reactors](http://wiki.industrial-craft.net/index.php?title=Nuclear_Reactor). This way, when my reactors run out of fuel, I still have my facilities power supplied while I [breed](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPsooG6N8hE) some [near-depleted cells](http://wiki.industrial-craft.net/index.php?title=Near-Depleted_Uranium_Cell) or dig more [uranium](http://wiki.industrial-craft.net/index.php?title=Uranium_Ore).

This MFSU array has the secondary objective to help me whenever my momentary power usage overcome my power plant output. As my array is big enough, I never get a blackout in my server's city areas.\n\nSaid that, I think batteries will/should be expensive/rare items (to make reactors more important), as their usage would be decisive specially during space battles. Let me reinforce my point: Suppose I have a huge array of batteries, capable of providing the same output as my reactor for 15 minutes. If I engage into one space battle without those batteries, I'd probably have to turn off every computer, most of my thrusting power and maybe even my shields to be able to fire strong enough laser beams to cut over the enemies hull. But, if I have them, I can do that, let's say, while cloaked. Or while moving. Maybe I can be cloaked, moving and keep my computers on to automatically control my targeting systems. Well, if my battery array is big enough, I can have the equivalent of many reactors for a short time span, or few extra reactors for quite long time.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"Here's my issue with Carriers:\n\n5-20 players COULD all move to the same ship and have their carrier operating, and when everyones online, that sounds like a lot of fun.\n\nBut how many people are online at any given time to operate their fighter craft? \n\nOn a 5 player craft? on average, 1-2 So you really have 1 pilot, and a guy who flies the fighter.\n\nThat is unless your carrier is based on Pod fighters that sit along the outside, connecting their guns into the main computer/gunner station so all the weapons could be brought to command with minimal players online? But only Notch knows if that kind of thing is going to be possible at this point.\n\nPersonally I think the battery idea is kind of...wrong for the fighter vessels.\n\nWhat would work possibly better is if fighters are more like dock-able 'away craft'/tactical fighting vessels that are self contained and powered by a single members power cell, able to go explore a planet shuttle craft style while the main ship stays on guard in orbit. Handy for the uses you spoke of, but not necessarily critical to ships fighting capacity.\n\nI see batteries as handy for powering the guns for a short time in a battle, to save extra power for the shields/cloak. However, if you're giving enough power to a fighter that it can last as substantial a time as to provide thrust, weapons, navigation etc. then I think that's a fairly over powered battery in the framework of the game. Else you'd simply have generators powering battery clusters for a week before going into battle with enough power to destroy a fleet, then again if batteries exist at all, and can be combined as a power source, than anyone with enough batteries could do this kind of thing.\n\n\n\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

It states that gravity is strong enough in the universe to eventually halt and reverse the expansion. This will eventually lead to the universe collapsing into itself (maybe sparking another big bang?).\n\nThe \"big rip\" is what happens if the expansion actually *increases*, due to dark energy. If it does, then eventually not even gravity, and then subatomic forces, will be able to hold everything together. This leads to a universe with nothing but a bunch of elementary particles. Not a good situation, to be sure.\n\nThe last possibility is the heat-death of the universe. This is where gravity isn't strong enough to halt the expansion completely, and so the universe expands forever. Eventually entropy will increase to maximum, and there will be no stars, galaxies, or structures of any kind. It will then cool off to absolute zero for eternity. \n\nThe heat-death scenario is the one most commonly accepted theory right now, I believe. I also think it is the one Notch is using for the lore in the game (Although it could possibly be the Big Rip, but I doubt it). If he was using the \"big crunch\" model, then the galaxies wouldn't have \"been forever lost to red-shift\". Because they would actually be heading back towards us. I'm afraid to say that in the world of 0x10c (and our world too), our universe is doomed to an eternity of *nothing* basically, after all the stars die.

{"body":"This is an absolutely valid point, that deserves a longer reply.\n\nMy philosophy when it comes to games (for mojang in particular) is to try to make games that last for a long time, adding features and evolving with the community over many years. I'd rather make a single Call of Duty that keeps changing than to make a new sequel every year.\n\nAs a result, it becomes difficult to tell when a game is \"finished\". For Minecraft, we basically just picked a point in time where we felt it represented a mostly complete game package and declared that the \"full version\", but we're very much still developing it (six people full time on the game alone, with more people on web, support, payment issues, and general business stuff (whatever that is)).\n\nThe combination of it being difficult to tell when the game is \"done\", us wanting to develop it publicly, and it working well for Minecraft, which is a similarly sandboxy game, led me to this decision fairly easily.\n\nBesides, if people are willing to fund Double Fine with several millions on an idea they know nothing about other than the genre, I am fine with us charging for something they can actually play with.\n\nI think it's an exciting time for gaming, where games no longer have to be developed in a vacuum.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

Props to the guys who made the call, it seems this is the right path.  Woulda done it myself but I'm in the for northern land of Canada and lack a proper long distance plan!\n\nHere's some useful points for those who don't want to go digging:\n\n* The long number as a phone number seems to be the key.  It appears to be a VoIP registered in Ohio, and the last 5 digits actually are 0x10c on a numpad.  [Thanks Anthrakia!](http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c/comments/13uapp/at_minecon_one_of_the_mojang_guys_told_me_that/c77dxf1)\n* The most basic recording is courtesy of Retroid and can be found [here](http://bitroid.com/dcpu.wav).\n* People have been filtering it and modifying it like crazy.  Most of the speculation is around what the first part says.  The second part everyone seems to agree is something along the lines of \"What?  What do you mean it's crashed?\"\n* A lot of people have tried gimmicky things on the signal, but to no avail.  Running it backwards does not appear to be meaningful.  [Link thanks to Dysalot](https://soundcloud.com/dysalot/dcpu-reverse/s-6BGoZ)  This isn't to count out this sort of analysis, but it could be difficult due to all the artefacting coming from it being a simple VoIP.\n* The location of Western Ohio appears to be significant as it is a reference to the [Wright-Patterson Air Base](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright-Patterson_Air_Force_Base).  (Thanks to adelais53 for pointing this out!)\n\n**Final Edit today I swear:**\n\n[Here's my own attempt at filtering the signal.](https://soundcloud.com/stufffff123123/notch-2)  I'm pretty confident that the message is \"The little endian is the one that ??? crashed.\"  Followed by a second person who says \"What?  What do you mean it crashed?\"  I created my filters by taking a STFT of the signal, and adding notch filters at the artefact frequencies.  [The STFT can be found here.](http://i.imgur.com/1RuZr.png)  There are some people talking about various other things, but the endian-ness seems consistent with the universe.  I won't be surprised if I'm wrong though.\n\nThe ??? sounds like \"BMV\" or something to me.  So ee, eh, ee sounds?\n\n**New Edit:**\n\nFrom [One Sided Die on the 0x10c forums](http://0x10cforum.com/forum/m/4932880/viewthread/5009757-potential-secret-in-mojangs-dcpu16-shirt/page/3), \n\n&gt; The 'little endian' is the one with the end byte last.\n\n&gt; Wait, what do you mean it's last?\n\nSeems to fit okay to me, but still not sold.\n\n**EDIT courtesy of bddap:**\n\n[bddap wrote a good post](http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c/comments/13uapp/at_minecon_one_of_the_mojang_guys_told_me_that/c77tb01) on some possible alternative wordings.  In particular, the first word is likely not \"the\" but rather \"so.\"  This makes much more sense.  Currently there seem to be two major theories.  One that this is a conversation between two people, or a recording of one side of a conversation.  This is a construction of the current theories:\n\n* Person 1:\n\n&gt; So little endian is the one with the low/last/end byte last.\n\n* Person 2:\n\n&gt; What?  What do you mean it's last?\n\n**OR:**\n\n* Person 1:\n\n&gt;  So little endian is the one with the low/last/end byte last, *pause* right? *pause* What do you mean it's last?\n\n**EDIT (I really need a better way to update this):**\n\nMaybe the endian-ness is just a clue, and we don't need to care about exactness of the words?  The number we called, 9372109102 or 0x22E9F092E in reversed endian is 0x2E099F2E02000000 or 3317358393580060672.  Probably irrelevant.  The original number backwards is 2019012739 or 0x7858B083.  ~~Maybe 201-901-2739 is another phone number?  Appears to be an Idaho area code (again can't call, no long distance :() Reversing the endian of this number is still a valid 32-bit number, interestingly, and is 220-937-2280.  This area code corresponds to West Africa though.  Probably invalid?~~  These numbers are invalid.  (Thanks fruicyjuit!)\n\n**EDIT again:**\n\nSo, [asteriskman made a really solid cleanup found here](https://soundcloud.com/asteriskman/0x10c-cleanup) and after combining this with bddap's work, I'm feeling confident in the following:\n\n&gt; So little endian is the one with the low byte last, *&lt;pause&gt;* right? *&lt;pause&gt;* What do you mean it's first?\n\nThis makes perfect sense, and would likely be the recording of one side of a phone conversation post-launch between the software developer that screwed the pooch and someone else.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

The fact is, that the DCPU-16 will be able to control functions of the ship, and you will be able to write software for it. This software will be available for people to buy from other players or whatever. You still have manual control over the ship regardless, you still manually fly it and so on, but you can for example, write software for automatic load balancing, or auto pilot, etc.\n\nYou still have manual control over the ship to fly, but giving players the option to not use the DCPU-16 computers and play the game without it entirely defeats a huge aspect of the game. Even if you aren't a programmer or have any knowledge about programming, you are still going to require those systems to manage and control specific ship functions. You aren't required to be able to write software or anything for the DCPu-16 computer if you aren't able to, you are just required to use the computer systems to play the game and run your ship. It's an integral part of the ship, it's like having no form of engine for the ship.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"**TLDR**: Since I'm self-taught, the only solid advice I can give is: learn a little coding (making the computer do stuff), then try to learn programming (deciding *what* to make the computer do).\n\nIt's the difference between designing a table and building it.  Or the difference between working out *what* you want to say and *how* you're going to say it.\n\nProgramming is basically problem solving in a computational context.  The less *wanky* way of putting it: it's figuring out what the algorithm and data structures should be, how the different components are assembled, etc. etc.\n\nCoding is translating a high-level solution down to something that can actually be executed.  It's about actually writing the code, choosing appropriate data types, abstractions, etc.  It's where you do things like choose between a class hierarchy and a table of function pointers.\n\nThe problem with learning them is that you really need to learn one to be able to really learn the other.  Without coding, you can't actually test your programming knowledge.  Without programming, you're stuck regurgitating programs someone else has designed.\n\nThey're separate concerns in as much as they operate at the polar opposite ends of the abstraction spectrum and require different skills.  They're no separate concerns in the sense that you really can't do one well without thinking about the other.\n\nBad programmers are really just coders who don't engage their brain very much.  Good programmers are those you think first, code second.  Great programmers are those who (successfully) do both at the same time --- I do not consider myself a great programmer.  :)","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

For now, we can't be sure our ships will be even maneuverable without computer-aided controls. This depends on how controls will be implemented.\nFor example: If ship will thrust forward, back and side with WSAD controls when your character is sitting in his cockpit, okay. However, think about a game where to move your ship you need to\n\n* Calculate by hand spatial bodies trajectories, movement speeds and plot a course to desired destination, considering slingshot effects, possible collisions and gravitation changes on trajectory by nearby bodies\n* Turn on first engine with reserve power\n* Turn on second engine with reserve power\n* Turn on third engine with reserve power\n* Relay 20% of main power to first engine by assigning timed ion intake\n* Relay 10% of main power to second engine by assigning timed ion intake\n* Relay 20% of main power to third engine by assigning timed ion intake\n* Use vectored thrusting on first engine and third engine to correct horizon with trajectory (manually calculating and setting angle and timing)\n* Use vectored thrusting on second engine to correct azimuth (manually calculating and setting angle and timing)\n* Fly with visuals\n* Pay attention to switch radio between known hailing frequencies according to every sector in order to avoid being shot as a trespasser\n* When in combat, calculate projectiles (and/or lasers) trajectories, deflection angles, aim, lock on target, shoot, get shot, manage power redirection to shields/deflectors/weapons/engines, and do all the above at the same time.\n\nMy point is, if notch wants, he can make the game be in any point between DCPU being a luxury stupid thing just useful for getting weather forecasts on planet surfaces AND DCPU being the very core of the game, meaning who has the most efficient computer controls will thrive.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"Perhaps one could use a dumb terminal instead for more text-centric displaying.  ASCII/ANSI were available at that time, and monochrome RS-232 terminals were common for UNIX-style systems.  These would be used via serial ports to the system and typically had an 80x25 screen.  Since such a resolution might be difficult to read in-game, perhaps 40, 50, or 64 column mode might make more sense in the context of 0x10c.\n\nPersonally, I'd be cool with serial ports in general being added and allowing their connection to be more free-form (and therefore easy to misconfigure) to devices such as dumb terminals, modems, or other devices.\n\nA simple serial point interrupt-map could consist of:\n\nA | Description\n--|--------\n1 | Set interrupt to value in B.  Interrupt is sent whenever status bits change (outside of interrupt 1) within the bit-mask set by C such that the revised status value is D (as masked by C).  See status bitmap below.\n2 | Set the status bits for the device from B, masked by C.  Setting any DATA bits will trigger a send.  This should set the outbound data bits which are latched only when both CTS and RTS are true.\n3 | Get the status bits from the device into B.\n\nOne way to do the status bits might be:\n\nName | Bit | Description\n-----|-----|--------\nDATA | 0-7 | Data bits.  On write (IRQ2) represent the octet to send.  On read (IRQ3) represent the last latched received octet.\nDTR | 8 | Data Terminal Ready -- the cable is plugged in and a device is able to accept commands (AT commands, for example).  However, no network or other intelligence is present currently.\nDCD | 9 | Data Carrier Detect -- the other side is ready to transport data (carrier detected).  Once both sides bring this to true a connection is made.  When either side drops this to false, it is disconnected.  Intelligent, non-network, devices would always show true for DCD.\nCTS | 10 | Clear to Send -- the other side is ready to receive an octet.  Will become false once reception of each octet begins and true once reception is complete.\nRI | 11 | Ring Indicator -- the device is requesting that DCD be brought to true by the other party.\nRTS | 12 | Request to Send -- the data may be latched and transmitted once CTS is set true from the other side (or immediately if CTS is already true)\n | 13-15 | Expansion?\n\nThis is obviously heavily simplified RS-232, avoiding the DTE/DCE complications.  In lieu of a baud rate IRQ, perhaps a fixed baud of 300, 8/N/1 would make sense, making a standard one-character-per-tick rate.\n\n[Edit: Realized IRQ 1 (get status) was redundant -- removed]","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"I think you're making the erroneous assumption that everyone designing hardware for use in space is either completely ignorant of, or unwilling/unable to address, the effects of radiation on electronics.\n\nThat's not to say that there can't be *limits* to what shielding/hardening can deal with, but I don't think it would be very realistic *or fun* to have just normal ambient radiation causing problems.\n\nAnd let's face it: computers aren't like mechanical devices where things have some give and take.  You can't \"sort of\" damage a program and have it act a little weirdly.  Corrupt an instruction and the computer will *literally* catch fire.  Corrupt a branch condition and suddenly the OS deletes all your files.  Corrupt the timer interrupt and suddenly the whole computer hard locks.\n\nBetter yet: corrupt one word in the boot loader and now you can't even start the machine to fix the operating system.  You're just outright screwed.\n\nWhat I'd like to see are high-radiation events or places which *will* erase or damage components *if you go in unprepared*.  For example, if I need to travel through an area with high radiation, give me the choice of going around (much longer trip) or preparing: put all my disks and such in a sealed lead box to protect them, give myself enough momentum to coast through, then shut everything down and wait.\n\nJust picture it.  You've shut everything down.  The usually omnipresent hum of the reactor and the engines, gone silent.  Only emergency lighting, leaving the rooms and corridors dark but for a few weak phosphorescent lights in the floor to divide the darkness and mark where the walls are.  The quiet creaking of the hull as parts cool and shift as you wait in darkness and silence.  You retreat to the bridge, the part of the ship most heavily shielded against radiation and wait.\n\nYou know just how dangerous it is in here.  Sometimes, a rookie pilot will lose it after the first few minutes and try to fire their computers back up for a quick game of Minesweeper.  They usually get found by scavengers a few weeks later, the ships drifting through empty space.  Computers fried.  Pilot a corpse.  But it's not the boredom that gets them, it's not knowing whether you're through or not.  Other times, a new pilot will be so terrified of powering back up too soon that they end up drifting for *days* past the radiation belt out of sheer terror.  If they're unlucky, they'll only realise they're past the radiation when the pirates attack.\n\nBut you know better.  You've done this a few times.  You keep your eyes fixed on the hull.  Staring through the front windows, you can just barely make out the faint blue light coming from the bow as it cuts through the ocean of highly charged particles.  You wait for the light to stop; you *always* wait for the light to stop.  Too many don't.\n\n...\n\nWait, what was I saying?

{"body":"I like the Noether (Zoltan Cruiser, Layout B) and the Man of War (Slug Cruiser, Layout A). Both are kinda tricky though.\n\nMan of War is nice because it comes powered with Breach missiles which are good to make enemy ships' crew lose focus on the normal actions to repair their hull holes and Anti-Bio beam, which is pretty effective when used with Dual Lasers in early game (ships with less than or 2 shield points). Killing enemy crew with Anti-Bio beam has shown to be pretty effective in gathering scrap. The main problem of this vessel is that AI controlled enemies or enemies with more than 2 shield levels require good weapon management (like using breach missile on shield room and dual lasers on the same room while trying to stay alive, then switching to Anti-bio beam to kill the crew). The nice part is having 2 slugs, so even without sensors you can use Anti-bio beam pretty effectively.\n\nNoether is nice because it has 3 zoltan crew - which eases the energy allocation problem, and has the zoltan shield - which is great because prevents boarding and gives you 5 shots advantage. Having 2 ion cannons, it's nice to deactivate shields and weapons early, and the pike beam can damage up to 5 adjacent rooms, which is great if you can sync your ion shots.\n\nSo far, from all the ships I've tried, I found those two the best.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

Why not just use one of those? Some of them even have FPUs, or access to more than 128kilo-octets of addressable memory.\n\n0x10c's DCPU is deliberately limited. It is designed to be limited both for nostalgia, and to limit the amount of resources that will be needed to run it when the multiplayer always-running aspect of the game is made. This is a good thing in the context of a game like 0x10c; however deliberate limitations do not make for a good ISA for production use. If the ISA of a real spacecraft is to be limited in some way, it should be based on actual, hardware design limitations, not on what's cool to program against.

This means you can make a huge lava river and have it light up your house from below, as the lighting can come from every single block of lava in the river. In 0x10c, there will be way less light sources, and as a result, they can be much more complex.\n\nAt one point, I had movable light sources in Minecraft, but they had two issues; 1) They were annoyingly choppy, as they only got updated once you moved a block, 2) they were slightly expensive to update. The first issue could've been solved by adding a different lighting model for carried lights, but if you wanted them to not shine through walls, you'd need a much more complex engine. The second one was fine until you realized that you would also want to see your friends carrying torches, and that you then also would want burning skeletons to emit light. It's a slippery slope of cpu draining that I decided against.\n\nI did not not add it out of spite or laziness, I actually tested all these things, and made design decisions that I thought was for the best of the game. In minecraft, the focus is on huge areas made up of millions of blocks that can all change at any time. In 0x10c, it's more about close quarters and feeling claustrophobic in a huge empty space, where the ship's interior doesn't change much as you play, so the game can make a lot of pre-calculations of the environment.\n\nI don't mean to imply I don't derp around, as I do that quite a lot, but it kind of gets to me when people assume I derp around.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"I agree, in most sci-fi type things the most damage done to a ship is its occupants getting broken noses from the ship being pushed around violently. \n\nIdeally, instead the shields wouldn't be fully shielding. The more energy you put into the shield, the more energy it takes from incoming projectiles (slowing down projectile weapons, and reducing the end power of laser beams).\n\nAnd yes, your own bullet should not be able to pass through shields. I also think it would be cool, if instead of just having a \"bubble\" around your ship, you have separate shield shaped (think viking shields, maybe with the ability to stretch them out for long ships) shields that you can arrange around your ship. A very good designer might be able to get a perfect fit (or maybe the shields should not function well near each other?) but a normally a ship would have weak spots. When something hits the shield some of the energy of it is deflected. However this uses the shield's buffer. Each shield has a buffer wattage and regen wattage. So maybe the shield can handle a 2MW burst of energy usage (caused by say a short burst laser) for 10 seconds and then it can refill the buffer in say 40 seconds (meaning it can handle sustained 500KW attacks, as the buffer is refilled at the same speed as it is used)\n\nImagine, two ships fighting each other. When one goes in for a ram. The shields explode in some manor if they hit each other (especially with force), but without them the ship is left vulnerable. So the pilot is forced to expertly move the ship in, timing the shield turn off to minimize the time spent unprotected.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

Notch seems to be more interested in this kind of space opera and has tweeted that he doesn't want to go completely hardcore on this issue, but the presumption that such a \"gravity generator\" is even going to be available is a huge leap.

I might suggest ':' for labels, '&amp;' for registers, and no sigil for variables, for instance:\n\n    #macro nextkey(target) {\n        push(&amp;i)\n        set &amp;i, [:keypointer]\n        add &amp;i, 0x9000\n        set target, [&amp;i]\n        ife target, 0\n            set &amp;pc, :end\n        set [&amp;i], 0\n        add [:keypointer], 1\n        and [:keypointer], 0xf\n    :end\n        pop(&amp;i)\n    }\n\n    nextkey(&amp;a)\n\nObviously this changes the language to look a bit less like raw assembly that people are getting used to writing (not to mention makes it rather less like a macro language), so there are definitely some costs to weigh. It might make more sense to, for instance, only have sigils on variable names.

It also allows for far more complicated AI per robot, and is a better design overall, since with N dcpus for M robots, N = M is much, much better than N = 1.\n\nAI also becomes easier to program. Robot hardware is simple enough to envision: It plugs into a section of memory that is associated with it. If the DCPU needs to give that hardware instructions (gun -&gt; fire), it sets the memory to the appropriate value. If the hardware needs to send the DCPU data (information about the surrounding world) the hardware sets the memory to useful values.\n\nExample hardware that is VERY lightweight that allows extremely complex robot behavior:\n\n * GPS: Sets the words in memory - the x, y, z location of the sensor relative to some object (the ships center of volume, etc).\n * Compass: Gives the rotation of the robot about all three Cartesian axes, again relative to some object (i.e., the ship).\n * Distance sensor: a small infra-red laser that detects the distance the laser travels before hitting an object. It controls at least a single memory location; it sets this word to be the distance detected. (These are fundamental to autonomous robot programming; they are the basis, as it were, for basically all algorithms where the robot does not have a map in advance.)\n * IFF: This would be the core module of combat robots: Basically, it detects the location of nearby entities, and places data describing them into the DCPU. The simplest way to have it work would be to have two lists, each with a maximum size (probably 10-20) - one for friends, the other for foes. This way, the robot already knows what targets are what (with inaccuracy, of course!), and can go directly to combat algorithms.\n\nGuns:\n\n * Gun: A cheap gun mount with a limited ability to turn in its mounting. The DCPU would have three words to manage - the yaw, pitch, and whether or not it should fire.\n * Turret: A more expensive gun mount, with unrestricted turning ability. Imagine a small swiveling turret on top of a robot, that can also aim all the way up and down. The robot can then move wherever yet the gun still be functional.\n\nMake sense?","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

See also [Langston Field](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langston_Field)\n\nThe big issue to the shield was that the energy that hit the shield needed to have some sort of energy storage device (aka capacitors and/or batteries) which could absorb the energy being received.  Once the energy capacity of those storage devices was exceeded, they could explode... thus providing a strong incentive for some players to keep the shield generator turned off unless absolutely necessary as opposed to the Star Trek force field that simply needs to have some power redirected from the warp core.\n\nThe other interesting side effect of this \"energy shield\" is that maneuvering or thrust is not possible when it is engaged.  That means ships which have it engaged can be \"tracked\" even if it isn't necessarily visible to outside ships.\n\nRegardless, if some sort of defenses like a \"shield\" is added to the game, I hope some serious drawbacks are added as well so it would need to be used strategically and not necessarily always on whenever a combat situation appears.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

I can see how you would protest this style, because it depends on an incorrect interpretation of relativity (can't go after than light because e=mc^2, so just set m=to 0), but it *can* be done better.

{"body":"Orbiting an arbitrarily small body is 'easily' done by matching your velocity with its gravitational pull. Go too fast, and you overshoot it. Go too slow and you crash into it. Go just right, and you enter a stable orbit. This is Newton's laws of motion 101. \n\nWhatever the value of 'just right' is, depends on the mass of the object you are trying to orbit along with your own current velocity, of course. This is not something you do by just flying straight at an asteroid, hit the breaks and hope for the best. The (very small) course corrections needed to make this work can start millions of kilometers in advance and need to be carefully planned. This is why the OP refers to the turning radius as being measured in AUs.\n\nSlowing down by using orbital mechanics is indeed possible. And is exactly how modern satellites and probes are being sent to places like Mars, Jupiter, etc. Our own moon is a prime example of this. By orbiting the Earth, the moon is actively removing energy in the form of angular momentum from the Earth. The Earth rotates slower and slower around its own axis, making our days longer by a few milliseconds every year. The moon in turn, goes faster and faster. This is why the moon is moving away from Earth at the rate of a few centimeters per year. Keep this up long enough, and the moon will reach a  point where it is going too fast to be held by Earth's gravity well. Result is that it will fly off and go into its own orbit around the Sun.\n\nDisclaimer: This is a very simplistic view of things. There are other factors in play here (like the gravity wells of the Sun and other planets), but the idea holds. The numbers are subject to fixing as well.\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"I don't totally dislike the idea to add an output delay based on distance from \"home\", but I think the potential of making really cool stuff increases substantially by not limiting anything (besides the speed of the DCPU).\n\nFor one thing, I kind of feel like the whole \"always on\" idea also suggests that logging off in hazardous space would be very ill-advised. The way I picture things is that your ship will still be very visible and vulnerable when you log off of the game. You probably could write a decent script that would automate a lot of the attack/defense, but I feel like it would be easy for a player who's actually playing to adapt and respond much better.\n\nThis also leads to something that was said about the generator on your ship and how a cloaking drive would probably require your to power down most everything else on your ship, including your DCPU. In this instance, cloaking when you log off would keep your ship safe from being seen, but would also mean you don't have enough power to keep your computer up and running.\n\nOf course, if you are logged on and also using your desktop resources, you could have a pretty decent advantage in some situations. I feel like the best way to combat this is the visibly expose the I/O system to users and make it more accessible to ALL users instead of making it a niche \"power user\" feature. Maybe a simple UI that ships with the game that provides a very easy method for users to interface with their ships computer without actually being online. Maybe even an online repository of \"apps\" that people have created that would be simple to install and use right away.\n\nOf course, there would still be plenty of room for the power users to do amazing things, but the exposure to people who maybe wouldn't have known about the interface at all before would probably get them asking questions and striving to know more when they see the type of advantage they could have by utilizing it more than the basic built-in UI.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

Diablo 2 had one. Many other games have them. \n\nNow, if you are referring to -features- that were added to the game which were inspired by mods, how does that reflect on the game's quality? Taking input from the community to help shape a game is a -good- thing.\n\nAs for that article, most of the criticism are ignorant elitism, or blatant hyperbole.

The \"slowed down the rotation\" probably means we got some made up pulsar radio data; and it's likely that this rotation is part of decoding it.\n\nOn the net it says a pulsar is emitting radio data like a lighthouse, so we can probably figure out the rotation speed from looking at the wave data.\n\nThinking about this a bit more, if the pulsar is emitting radio data while rotating it'd mean we get to see only a short snapshot of the radio signal while the pulsar is facing us. So figuring out the rotation speed would allow us to extract the fragments of radio data and maybe piece it together to an actual audio signal.\n\nOn the other hand, if the rotation speed is near the sampling rate this may not be relevant at all because we'll just sample the data while its facing us.

{"body":"That's the thing - People who don't like aspects of your work might like to alter the tool to better suit them, and that's all we are asking to be able to do. But at this point, the copy is in their hands and changes won't affect your project at all, lest you choose to let it.\n\nTo provide practical examples - Let's say I use DevKit, but I don't like the hotkeys for function XYZ. If the source was open, on say GitHub, I'd start up a fork and change those hotkeys to suit my mangled, alien hands. Perhaps this would be the \"Mangled-Hands Usability Fork\" of DevKit. People who like the hotkeys in the default, go to you. People who like the hotkeys because their hands are mangled, go to my fork. Of course, due to the changes being very minor, it could be instead distributed as a patch that could be applied by end-users prior to compiling.\n\nPoint is, though, the MHU Fork wouldn't impact you at all, unless I notified you of the fork (or you became aware of it yourself) and you thought \"Hey, that's actually a pretty good idea, I'll merge it into the main project\". Or, you could say \"Nah, that might work for him, but for people with normal hands my hotkeys are better\", and not merge. Either way, I don't mind if you use my code, because hey, I've got what I want - A version of DevKit, even if I have to maintain it myself, where the hotkeys suit me a little more.\n\nOf course, hotkeys are a trivial example. Other forks might do other UI changes, or investigate some novel ways to speed up various processes. Another might strip back some features to make that fork a little leaner and meaner, another might replace the code editing area with vim (or Emacs, though hopefully not). One might implement features that you haven't even thought about, another might implement features that you specifically don't want, but they do.\n\nAt the end of the day, though, these forks don't need to impact the main codebase unless you want them to, and their existence doesn't hurt you in the slightest of ways. But the reason that people want to see DevKit open source is that, at the end, they *see* this great body of code that you've worked on, this great homely house, but they just want to change the tap fittings a bit.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

There could be a couple of consoles directly in front of the screen, next to each other, maybe one for steering the ship, and one for monitoring ship operations.\n\nThen, behind the two front consoles, there could be some chairs for the command officers, and behind that, on a raised platform, tactical and engineering work stations.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}
