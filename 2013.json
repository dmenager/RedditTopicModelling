I don't mean to be saying anything bad about him either, he's accomplished quite a bit and seems like a great guy, and this I think is as much as a positive as it is as a negative, but I was going back and watching some of his old interviews from when Minecraft started getting famous and stuff, and it kinda just really showed he hasn't changed much since he got rich and stuff. Specifically what he said when they asked him: \"So where do you see the game in two years?\" (From [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34942_GyNHY) interview on March 31, 2010)\n\n\"In two years; that's really hard to tell - if you would have asked me, like, half a year ago I would have said that I would have stopped rate that I was working on something else, but since I changed my plan now and I plan to keep working for as long as people like it, I don't know, there are a lot of things I can do to this game that are really interesting, and it really depends on - I try to go with - like - the features I add - if I see the people use them that's probably where I want to keep developing cause I get the most feedback and It's most fun to work on it so it depends. What happens in a month play, you would never know, and stuff like that.\"\n\nThen he goes on to explain, when asked \"What would you say your biggest obstacle was in creating the game?\"\n\n\"Biggest obstacle in creating the game...hmm...I'm not sure...I think, actually, yea, this, um, like a few months before Christmas, I was, before I started rewriting the engine, I was having some like, I'd made a few bad development decisions in the code so I had, like, spaghetti code, and ah, the game was starting to really take off and bring in some money and I started like, freak out. I wasn't sure what I was doing, ah so, then I got some morale issues I think, so a couple of months in development there was pretty slow, so, I think that's actually the biggest obstacle I've had so far.\"\n\nBasically the gist I got from these two things is that Notch is really good at coming up with fun ideas, and when he can implement them without too much difficulty and see the work pay off, he enjoys it and gets pretty motivated and gets a lot of stuff done - and is an amazingly focused and talented programmer/game developer.\n\nOn the other hand, when things aren't going so well (especially compounded with the stress of being famous and community and stuff), he gets pretty stressed out, and loses motivation, especially when he needs to work on the boring things - which is pretty understandable. This isn't totally true, as he worked on quite a bit of the emulator stuff and lighting in Minecraft and such, which most people would probably see as pretty boring, but in general, if there isn't much progress made or the code starts getting pretty cluttered, he get's discouraged.\n\nUnfortunately though, in terms of 0x10c, this means that we might not have much hope. As far as I've seen from most of these space like projects, it seems pretty fun and easy at first, which gets a lot of people started with the programming and such. Yet, as the programming get's going, you have to start having LOD algorithms, mapping nose algorithms to a spherical surface and somehow maintain data around that, calculate lighting and such from the planet, make scary atmospheric scattering things and such to make the stuff look good, and while you're at it somehow make good physics calculations and do all of this at a good FPS. It's taken some amazing programmers, and I wouldn't hesitate to include Notch in that group, but still, it's taken some amazing programmers 3-4 months just to get a planet with terrible looking Perlin noise mountains that runs kinda maybe ok. This seems reasonable, except to consider that many of them first just considered it as a week project or something, because it really doesn't seem that bad - until you start getting into all of the gory details. Then you add asteroids and ships and such, and it's no wonder many of these games seemed to turn into vapor-ware, unfortunately. Some worked out, but the good ones are far and few, for how many space projects have been started. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure they all were great experience, even with just my [limited attempt](http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c/comments/17d04a/i_made_planets_woot/) I learned a ton, but still, what I'm saying is that making a space game is *hard*. *Very hard*.\n\nIn conclusion, I just think that, given Notch's sayings on his experience with things in the past, and given the painful difficulties of really no *good* engineering ways to make a planetary system like this, Notch is bound to lose focus and move on. I'd love him to prove all of the naysayers here (including me) wrong, but as for now, it looks like we don't have much hope.\n\nOn the other hand, as others have said here, he did start making merchandise and stuff for it, and did pretty good at building hype for 0x10c, with the interviews and website and hiring Jonatan P\u00f6lj\u00f6 and stuff, that maybe those were partially his ways of telling us \"don't worry guys, I know I'll probably lose motivation from time to time, I'm getting into a hard thing here, plus I'm human, but I still care about you guys, and I'll make something wonderful, just give me some time.\"  I'd love to think this is true, this game really does sound amazingly fun even with just the DCPU part, that I think I'll just cling to the hope of something around what rshorning said (below): That it's probably best if we're just patient, wait until summer time or such when the game development events start to simmer down, and Notch has a chance to start playing with the Occuls rift and such.\n\nOr maybe I'm just over analyzing every little bit of this because I'm bored. Yea, probably that. Still, I hope we'll see something come out of his idea in the end, Mojang really is an amazingly unique game company, and 0x10c seems like exactly the kind of thing that could only come from a (sort of ish now) indie company like them.\n\nOr really, I guess if all else fails, even if notch loses motivation in this and moves on to another great idea which can probably spawn plenty more games by itself, that really wouldn't be too much of a problem. There are plenty more than enough developers here that would be willing to start making this game themselves in their spare time (myself included, I hope) and have already made some open source projects, from anywhere to the *many many* DCPU emulators to somethings as extreme as 0x10c world simulators (not quite sure how that works when there isn't a world yet, but still, the idea of something cool is there), that if we were able to collaborate well enough together something amazing could come out of it - plus it be cool as a pretty unique (I think - I'm curious if there are any others) game entirely developed by the community of the game itself. We'd have to make some sort of hierarchy and voting process and discussion and such for how we want game play to work and balance and such, the biggest thing probably just being the source control itself, but I think it might work. And be amazing and then some, if it did.\n\nIn the end, too, it looks like our best option right now is just to wait, discuss, speculate, and cross our fingers.\n\ntl:dr Seeing his old interviews and stuff, Notch often loses interest when things get hard, stressful, or code gets cluttered, or all of the above. Space games are hard, so this is bound to happen, and we may never see an 0x10c. We can still hope though, and if all else fails, Notch can move on and we can make it ourselves, so there's not too much to worry about.\n\nedit: a tl:dr for the tl:dr is probably unnecessary (removed).","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"What, because you're concerned about your imaginary internet points total? Please.\n\nThe thing about downvotes, especially when there are a *lot* of them, is it tends to indicate two things: One, that the community disagrees with you, and two, that you're being overly abrasive. There are, of course, other scenarios (troll accounts, arrow-to-the-knee comments), but let's ignore these for a moment.\n\nNow, people can handle disagreement. Disagreement, itself, is fine in communities, and when *eloquent* enough, won't be slapped down, but rather discussed. It's the whole spoonful of sugar thing - If you're charismatic enough, people are gonna value your commentary, and maybe you'll spark a decent, civilised debate.\n\nHowever, people don't like - and don't have time - for overtly abrasive comments, and it just so happens that abrasive comments against the general community opinion stand out more than abrasive comments for the general community opinion. An example of this (albeit, a rather trivial, small example) is one of *your* comments:\n\n&gt; Now that he's rich, he ignores his community, so sit back and relax.\n\nWhich is, currently speaking, at +2/-3.\n\nNow, the reason that the community (or, a very small subset of the community, but I'm not going to spend my time to find something with a billion and ten downvotes just for this discussion) didn't like that comment is because it has very, very strong negative connotations. You've neglected to include that spoonful of sugar, instead, you've gone down the route of simply saying \"Here is my opinion! Suck it, suck it hard.\" And nobody likes that, because you're not giving them any reason to do so - you're just being an average douche with an opinion.\n\nIf I shared your opinion (I don't) and had to pen your above comment, I'd angle for something more like this:\n\n&gt; Ever since Notch has had great financial success, I think he's grown distant from his community, which is a great shame indeed. All we can do now is wait, really, and I fear we'll be waiting a fair while.\n\nThe reason that this would have worked better is because it's *tempered* a bit, it's less abrasive, it's more eloquent. For example, the term \"rich\" has strong negative connotations to it in most western, lower-to-middle class cultures - and surprise surprise, that's generally where redditors are, right in that socio-economic group.\n\nBeyond that, tempering your opinions (\"grown distant\" instead of \"ignored\", speaking in terms of your own thoughts instead of in absolutes) make your arguments more palatable to those who disagree with it. People aren't going to listen to those who they think aren't worth listening to - so demonstrate that you're worth listening to. Be nice.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"I think after you were done plugging all the hole's where potential balance issues could crop up would be even more limiting.. \n\ntaking example 1: from the perspective of a game designer, you would have to spend quite a bit of time making sure this didn't happen. it's just not \"fun\" for the dude on the recieving end. its one of those features that gets added to the list during brain storming and sounds really cool and cut-throat. but then gets universally panned in play testing because it's frustrating for the recieving player but doesn't help add any sense of accomplishment later on. \n\n2 and 3 seem ok.\n\n4 seems easy enough to just put in the game from the beginning. except again, its one of those awesome features on paper that just isn't that fun in practice. \n\n5 sounds like it could be nice, but limited in real usefulness. \n\n6 sounds reasonable. not sure though that you want to allow players to give up control of their ship. \n\n\n\n\nMy suggestion there, grab some off the shelf game engine (unity for example) and mock this up for some play testing. there are a LOT of concepts that seem really cool and fun, but once your actually playing with them it's like \"ok this works.. its cool.. but.. it's not very fun.\" \n\n\na great example is the remote tech plugin for kerbal space program. it adds radio physics to the game, you lose line of site to your unmanned ship, you can't control it any more, same if you go out of range, it also adds realistic delay to the commands based on radio path length. its really cool stuff and makes the game much harder. problem is, you never find yourself \"enjoying\" it. once you have your relay network in place, you really have no need to touch it again, if you screw it up it's an obstical but never really provides any benefit, in the end it becomes a reason to not use unmanned stuff. it's just not \"FUN\".\n\nin the end it's a classic example of a game system that needs the lead designer to say \"wow thats cool, but it doesn't make the game more fun and doesn't offer much interaction with other systems.. i need to cut that.\"\n\nnow that i've completely trashed that mod. i must admit, i think it's really well made and really awesome.

{"body":"Good points. To clarify mine, I don't for a second doubt the communities ability to create ingenious solutions to problems.\n\nBut rather, I'm not sure that doing so would be fun for any except a tiny minority in this case... obviously that's open to debate, and while I wouldn't encourage Mojang to make a game that has to be all-inclusive at the cost of artistic direction, it obviously needs to enthrall enough people for it to be commercially viable. So, 0x10c will probably have to appeal to non-programmers (and those who don't want to programme) for it to be sucessful.\n\nBut I think somewhere between dogfights in space and keplers third law of planetary motion lies the potential for an exciting game.\n\nMy concerns about a hyper-realistic sim is it incurs huge server side overheads - and in turn is only fun for a small group of programmers to solve. And once they've solved it, its a copy-pasta job for the rest of the community to include it in their own DCPU code... so all that overhead was just an irritating obstacle to be overcome by most players, while they try to have fun. And long after the fun of creating an orbital transfer programme has faded we are all still left dealing with the latency its physics cause.\n\nTl;dr My impression was this was always going to be a 'lasers in space' kind of game. The DCPU is a fun side to it, but I think if you're expecting a 1st person Kerbal Space Program it might be disappointing... of course I suppose theres no reason why it couldn't be modded?","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

I was talking about **mods** like boatmod/airship mod etc. that add 3D movement to entities, appearing as voxel elements.\n\nI just felt that StarMade really was, even down to the technical level, **very** heavily and exclusively influenced by minecraft - perhaps that is coming from a developers perspective though.  Certain features really pushed it home - like the navigation mechanic and the appearence of planets both felt like awkward hangovers from the mechanics of minecraft that did not lend themselves well to the space genre. If you look at games like Cubeworld, Rodina etc. they've created their own innovative procedural generation techniques to fit in with their themes in a much more innovative way than StarMade. Another good example is Eve online that uses a proportional scaling mechanic to simulate the size of space very effectively.\n\nMy overall impression was comfortably that StarMade fitted into the clone category, contrary to the protests of its developer. Cubeworld, Minecraft and their precussor Infiminer have a more unique and distinctive feel. I've seen this in my own main field of art - some artists are very technically competent, they just aren't very good at coming up with their own ideas.

The most interesting is the ENIAC, which actually used two digit words (ENIAC was actually a base ten computer rather than binary).  The 16 bit word size used by the DCPU was even used to an extent by the DIGITAL PDP-11 series of computers, where bytes were mainly used for communications.\n\nEven the 8086 CPU pretty much used 16 bits for almost all internal and external access, but in that case the backward compatibility to the 8008 CPU (and to even a strange bit the original 4004 CPU) kept quite a few byte oriented operations happening... not to mention that the English language and making 8-bit character strings encouraged the use of bytes far more than likely would have been the case had it been developed in China or Japan.\n\nIf anything, the 16-bit word sizes in the DCPU really works well to remind those working with it that there are a whole bunch of cultural reasons for things in computers that have nothing at all to do with efficient hardware design.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"You have to provide a way to return from an interrupt and set the user mode at the same time (i.e. in a single instruction). With your solution, one can either RFI but still be in kernel mode because he couldn't RMS before the execution flow was moved somewhere else, or RMS but then the following RFI instruction will be ignored because the DCPU is already in user mode. Considering the only way to get into kernel mode is with an interrupt, this means that user mode wouldn't be usable practically.\n\nIf you want this to work, you can say that RMS only sets the bounds of kernel space, and RFI does what it currently does plus set user mode.\n\nProblem is, if an interrupt is triggered while in kernel mode (because you disabled interrupt queuing for some (possibly good) reason), you will get stuck in user mode once you returned from this new interrupt. Maybe you could say that RFI sets the mode depending on where it moves the execution flow. By setting the kernel space bounds to [0x0000;0xffff] by default, it would actually allow your proposition not to affect already existing code.\n\nThat said, I don't think Notch will implement this because it seems he wants the DCPU to be a fragile CPU. But it would definitely be a nice feature.\n\n**EDIT:** I'm also not a big fan of the \"fail silently\" thing. An interrupt should be triggered in those cases. If you intend the modification to be transparent, then if the kernel knows about modes and uses them, it will know how to handle the triggered interrupt. You might need an instruction to set the interrupt message to be used though.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

You have this preconception of how the static compilation progress of C++ have some sort of extra-superboost and that Java wastes all its resources on nth-generation garbage collection or something like that. JIT compilation has a few advantages over C++ _completely static_ compilation process. Since Java actually works with content and object references and not memory addresses, it can use a few optimization tricks C++ generally can't. One of them being utilizing stack and heap allocations automatically. Java uses primitives properly also, so operations on primitives will not be any slower than in C++. Java can also take advantage of platform specific optimizations like SIMD-extensions without having to rely on specific libraries especially compiled for a certain processor. Java can also use inline code expansion on functions that span several external modules, something C++ typically can't (because of the compilation process' static nature).

The majority of game titles released aren't really that descriptive.\n\nAs I've said in other posts, I really don't have a problem with people not playing the game because they either don't understand it, or can't remember the name long enough to Google it.

{"body":"This is assuming you recompile the DCPU assembly to native assembly and that it has a 1-to-1 mapping. If you do the interpretation dynamically, there's no way you could run 1000 on a 1GHz CPU. I'd take off at least an order of magnitude for dynamic interpretation. \n\nBut even considering full speed compiled code, and a 4GHz clock with 4 cores, you still only get 16000 CPUs. If you want a universe of things happening, you will need way more than 16k CPUs running in real time, plus other things beyond just the CPUs. Even just the building I'm in right now would probably need more than 16k DCPUs to be simulated \"correctly\". So more is needed than just fast DCPU emulation.\n\nOne thought is that each player could contribute some of the DCPU performance in a peer-to-peer fashion if the game is decided to have some MMO aspects. Then, as the population playing increases, you would be able to add more and more detail, or more and more worlds. This would also potentially solve the problem of server hosting to some extent, albeit at the cost of significant engineering effort.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

(the first table in the spec) One of them is:\n\n     [nextword + register]\n\nThe square brackets mean that this should be interpreted as a pointer, meaning that the value at this memory address is used. Without the brackets, you would just be editing the literal value, which is meaningless (and the spec doesn't allow it anymore).\n\nIn your example you use a label, but at compile time this label is understood as a literal value of the memory address where that label is.\n\nThe beginning of the program starts at memory address 0 (or so the compiler assumes) and each instruction uses 1-3 words of memory. \n\nThe online compiler/emulator [dcpu.ru](http://dcpu.ru) is really good for visualizing this because it shows the memory address of each line as well as the compiled output line by line.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

Meaning, you will have your ship (maybe one of a few to choose) and DCPU should already be running a certain program (which, for instance, set you to sleep and was running the ship's navigation for all that time). The ship must be severely damaged though, I can't imagine any material sustaining such a long travel, it should litterally rot by then...

{"body":"I love C++, and have been writing in it for years, however I don't use it for commercial software anymore and the reasons are simple.  You're a 100% right that the majority of games were written in C++, however with the popularity of engines like Unity and (the now dead) XNA we've seen the rise of higher level languages.\n\nIn fact these days the majority of development isn't in C++ but scripting languages like LUA. If you look at the man hours of any AAA title very little time is spent in C++, the majority is on design, scripting and assets. In this regard what I was suggesting is actually closer to the modern reality of games development.\n\nNotch wrote Minecraft which (in brief over simplification) is the less peformant ancestor of C#. (I first developed in Java in 97).  Also the volunteers thus far appear to mention unity and C# frequently.\n\nModern .NET includes async abilities and task support that promotes easy and high performance parallelism, something that the average C++ games developer (and, to be fair, the better anything developer) are notoriously bad at.  As such if you put two developers of average ability in a room to write a large client server app the C# developer will not only finish better but write more robust higher performing code.\n\nI say this as someone who performs over 160 developer interviews a year and teaches developers.\n\nAs such, I honestly believe that, unless you attract that one in a million developer, the approach I suggested maximises your success.  To be fair, I also acknowledged that the project may require a custom engine and suggested C++ for that task.\n\nIn development, as in life, it's all about a balance of probabilities there is no definitive 'right' or 'wrong' approach.\n\nTL;DR respectfully disagree with stated reasons based on actual experience rather than assumed pseudo-facts","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

Ridiculous features/simulations make little sense as game dynamics for what is meant to be an easy, enjoyable, mainstream game.\n\nHowever, some games, like [Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/) or [Orbiter 2010](http://orbit.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/) specialize in ultra-realism, and their playerbase is mostly composed of geeks who really like that kind of thing, just for the sake of being incredibly accurate. For example, in Dwarf Fortress, if your war elephant is attacking a goblin, it will know, and tell you, precisely which toenail on the elephant is broken, and which internal organs the tusk pierces, and the likes, dislikes, hobbies, preferences, skills, and detailed family history for up to 5000 years into the past, of every single dwarf (and elf, kobold, or rat.). Or in the Orbital Sim, it will take into account the effect of photons hitting your spaceship on your orbit. In the DCPU-16, 0x10^C shares a great many of these characteristics, seeming to be a game with at least some ultrarealistic elements, and so, even for all its shortcomings and disadvantages, taken in this light, a semi-realistic ingame interpretation of general and special relativity does not seem ridiculously far fetched, especially that (faster than) light speed travel may feature prominently, and hanging around black holes all day is the kind of thing the players might tend to do. Of course, that's not necessary to travel in the future, Notch has already provided specialized spaceship hardware to do exactly that!","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

What it **does** look like is another Mojang product... Minecraft. And the reason it bears a striking resembalance to minecraft is because it's a poorly coded knock off... basically a space themed procedurally generated voxel editor.

Singleplayer at launch with multiplayer to follow, may include a programmable CPU. Predates 0x10c and has been acknowledged by Notch -- probably the closest project to what 0x10c was likely to be.\n\n* **Wayfarer** In development. http://brightspritegames.com/wayfarer-the-outer-reaches.html Two developer 3D indie sandbox game (no CPU aspects announced). Not expected till late 2014 at earliest, currently preparing for kickstarter launch (so they are kicking around on the money hunt!). Visually impressive for an indie game but a long way off.\n\n* **EVE-Online** Available for monthly subscription. http://www.eveonline.com/ Major longstanding MMO. No CPU aspects but probably the single largest sandbox game of any genre ever made. Visually impressive despite its age, constantly updated - but plagued by a steep learning curve and non newbie-friendly atmosphere.\n\n* **Void Destroyer** In development. http://www.voiddestroyer.com/ Single developer 3D indie game. Currently in Kickstarter stage (raised $20K) and the creator has been around here looking for cash. Looks similar to EVE Online - No CPU aspects but actually remarkably detailed for an indie game.\n\n* **Faster than Light (aka FTL)** Playable Alpha. http://www.ftlgame.com/ Two developer 2D indie space themed resource management game. One of the most sucessful projects on Kickstarter ($200K pledged!) with a playable beta version already available on steam for ~\u00a37. No CPU aspects but has got a very big following in a short space of time for such a simple game.

{"body":"A sandbox game implies that you won't be able to predict what combinations of items or environments players will create. On a game like Halo, if you know that the player will never use a tank on level 2, you get to skip testing the tank on that level. So, you can focus on what bugs are likely, because you know what items can possibly interact. This is why a lot of glitches in Halo involve vehicles being used in areas the designers didn't expect.\n\n\nOn a hypothetical  sandbox game, you can't expect players to put the tank on top of a big pile of glass goblets and shoot them. So when the combined explosive force of the glasses shattering manages to send the tank through a wall that it should be blocked by, because they made the goblets' shattering force slightly stronger than they should be.\n\nSo yeah, the very nature of sandbox games means that yes, you should expect glitches, moreso than a traditional linear story game.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

The first thing you'll notice is how _insanely_ shitty the graphics are. And I don't mean the sort of \"some of these pixels are an off-color\" I mean it's _literally the worst I have ever seen_. The planet(s) are gigantic and they use this enormous polygons to create the terrain (too big) - ok, maybe you'll say this is justified for a world this large. Well, turns out they _don't use shadow maps_ but instead rely on _gourad shading_ for lighting. For some reason you start out with a torch, but because of the size of the polygons and the technique they use for lighting, the torch will only work (slightly) when you're at the edge of a polygon. When you walk, the z-buffer is incorrectly set, so that the torch will get a cut off when it moves back and forth (from the \"walking\" motion). Mobs apparently are \"evolutionary generated\" and look like shit. It's also impossible to do anything about them because they just lag around like idiots.

But on the 0x10c issue I think he is a bit hypocritical, the community only responded naturally to what he asked them to do.\n\nStrikes me that Notch will probably spend the rest of his career wrestling with this problem of trying to excite people without building expectations too high (as he seems pathologically unable to cope with that kind of pressure). I hope he works it out, because it would be a shame if he just sits in that office fucking around with the 3D printer and the occasional .party() out of fear he might dissapoint someone off the internet with a failed product.\n\nIt is the inevitable fear that follows sucess, of worrying you might follow it with a failure. Unfortunately though its all part of being so sucessful. He'll have to learn to deal with it or become typecast as a one-hit wonder.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

There is an autopilot which makes docking with space stations that are orbiting planets and spinning about themselves a fully automated process, which I find boring, but you can [manually perform the docking](http://i.minus.com/iQUX0iPl2sqJh.gif) yourself and see how hard it is to do. It is surprisingly disorienting, and a fun challenge! \n\nThe [game world](http://i.minus.com/ibmiMwG5t5RJb3.gif) is actually at a 1:1 scale with the [Milky Way galaxy](http://i.imgur.com/OClkVb8.png) (consisting of a mix of real celestial bodies and generated ones), so even with a max acceleration of about 16 G's for the starter ship (which in reality would not be quite survivable for the human body) it can take days to get from one planet to another within the same [solar system](http://i.imgur.com/QAS03Rx.png). There is a fast-forward feature so you don't actually have to wait that long, and for interstellar travel there are [hyperdrives](http://i.imgur.com/QhBG4oy.png).\n\nWhile I will be keeping an eye on Pioneer to see how it develops and gains features (it's free and open source by the way), my hope is that 0x10c is going to simulate the physics **at least** as accurately.

The main 'point' of the game I suppose is the economy, and almost every item in it is player made/transported/traded.  \n\nIn terms of rigging ships it is very technical -- so much so that this is really where it falls down. Apart from that the ship designs are beautiful and varried, the world is visually impressive and the range of gameplay is pretty diverse. \n\nThe problem with EVE is the learning curve is notoriously hard (to the point that, in my opinion, it stops the game being fun to play), and most players have been playing for years and years making it particularly difficult to crack into as a newbie. The gameplay is very dry and slow especially to start with - though I will conceede it is much more fun if you group up and make friends early in the game.\n\nIf there is one game out there that is 0x10c without the DCPU, then realistically it is EVE online.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

At all. None**. Please please please read what I've actually said and not what Jeremy has interpretted. Notch doesn't have any kind of monopoly of space based games or CPU emulation in games. Both have been done before countless times. What I am saying is the extent of similarity between Jeremys project and this is unreasonable, and if you go back to my very first post on the matter I said it *could* cause legal problems - not that it certainly would. Neither of us can really say either way whether it will. I strongly doubt Mojang as a company would back legal action in the first place... but if they did, whether it would be sucessful is highly conceptual since no case like this has ever been fought. **So I suggest we all move off that for a second, because its going round in circles playing into manipulative hands**.\n\n&gt; It does look like you think Notch has patented this idea though\n\nIf you can find any post of mine where I at any stage suggest I think Notch has a patent over the DCPU I would love to see it - because I haven't. I'm not sure if you're confusing patent and copyright and thats where the source of this confusion is coming from?\n\nWhat I have said is simply this: The DCPU, whilst being a CPU spec, was developed purely as part of the games lore and mechanic - as such it is a creative component NOT just any old CPU spec like the Motorola 6809E. It was developed purely for this task and no other. I want to be utterly clear about this **I am not arguing about the technical specification of the DCPU being patented**. What I am saying is the DCPU, as a creative component of the game IS, in principle at least, subject to copyright. The DCPU is an expression of creativity, its part of the story, part of the mechanic... don't be led astray by thinking its a CPU spec so is somehow a special exception.\n\n&gt; What I see you doing here is complaining about even the idea that somebody other than Notch is making a space-based game with a CPU emulator at its core. \n\nNo no no no no. That is not what I am doing here. **I fully support the idea, I have NO issue with the concept. NONE. ZERO.** I am actually extremely excited about seeing what comes out of Rodina (a similar CPU emulating space game). My issues lies soley in the extent of similarity between the two projects. It is acceptable to recognise a good idea when you see one and make your own attempt at it. This I fully appreciate. However it isn't acceptable to completely rip an idea off... even if they outcome looks and feels nothing like Notch's version, on paper at least (particularly with the name) the extent of similarity here is painful.\n\n&gt;  He doesn't really need to even have Notch's permission on even starting this project, and that is where you are simply wrong.\n\nI've never said he does. What I've said is, if he wants to use the DCPU he should ask Notch's permission, for the reasons addressed above. Whether he 'needs' to is largely moot, since none of us can say for sure... but it is the reasonable and adult thing to do.\n\n**I have argued all along, that what this project needs are a few minor changes and some civility to make it more reasonable, nothing more.** ","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

The only suggestion I've seen before on this issue was quite complex - probably more powerful, but too complex for the DCPU-16, IMO.\n\nThe idea behind this was to create a simple and easy to understand way of fixing the \"it's impossible to be even a little bit secure on the DCPU-16 without either solving the halting problem (I expect it's about that hard to determine with certainty beforehand whether a program does anything privileged), or by emulating the DCPU-16 on the DCPU-16\" problem.\n&gt;[rest of your post]\n\n*goes away and fixes it*\n\n**On Failing Silently**\n\nA new instruction, `PIM a`, should set the Privileged Instruction Message. If a is nonzero, set PIM to a. If a is zero, disable privileged instruction interrupts. If privileged instruction interrupts are enabled, executing a privileged instruction (IAS, IAQ, HWI, PIM or RMS) will trigger a software interrupt with message PIM. Otherwise, they fail silently, which the the default behaviour.\n\nPossibly a similar instructions for memory access (PMM - Privileged Memory access Message). Heck, you could even add one for illegal instructions e.g. executing 0x0000 (IIM - Illegal Instruction Message), but that's a little out of scope.\n\n**On Troubles with RFI**\n\nThis is where it gets a little tricky. There a couple of options:\n\n1. Backward incompatible and a little hand-wavey, but certainly a simple solution: The DCPU-16 'remembers' the most recently user mode bounds, and RFI reapplies them. Backwards incompatible because interrupt queuing would have to be permanently on in kernel mode (enforced by CPU). Because of that, I don't like this option much, but I include it for completeness.\n2. A mostly backwards compatible solution would be for IAQ and INT to do the following:  \n      \n        RFI a | RMS PEEK 3, PEEK 2 \\ SET A, POP \\ SET PC, POP \\ ADD SP, 2 \\ IAQ 0\n        INT a | IAQ 1 \\ SET PUSH, current-lower-memory-bound \\ SET PUSH, current-upper-memory-bound \\ SET PUSH, PC \\ SET PUSH, A \\ SET PC, IA \\ SET A, a (also returns to kernel mode)\n\n    At first I quite liked this solution, but I see more problems with it every time I look at it. It breaks any current interrupt code that relies on data being on the stack below A and PC. That's really bad.\n3. New special registers, like `IA`: `LM` (current lower memory bound) and `UM` (current upper memory bound).\n\n        RFI a | RMS LM, UM \\ SET A, POP \\ SET PC, POP \\ IAQ 0\n        INT a | IAQ 1 \\ SET LM, 0 \\ SET UM, 0xFFFF \\ SET PUSH, PC \\ SET PUSH, A \\ SET PC, IA \\ SET A, a - when in kernel mode\n        INT a | IAQ 1 \\ SET PUSH, PC \\ SET PUSH, A \\ SET PC, IA \\ SET A, a (also returns to kernel mode) - when in user mode\n\n    First, an explanation: `INT` will return to kernel mode, but it doesn't change `LM` and `UM`. Therefore `RFI` is able to very easily return to user mode. What's more `RMS 0, 0xffff` is a no-op - it doesn't return to user mode. So whichever mode we are in when the interrupt is triggered, we return to that mode after the interrupt.  \n    I think this works quite well. It doesn't break existing code, as far as I can tell. When I first looked at this after writing it, I thought: but what happens if an interrupt is triggered while in kernel mode, handling another interrupt? UM and LM will be set to 0xffff and 0x0000 respectively, so when we return from the original interrupt, we will return in kernel mode! But that's okay. You shouldn't disable interrupts during interrupt handling. Ever. I've never heard of a reentrant interrupt handler.\n\nSo yes, if my entire suggestion was accepted, we'd have two modified instructions (`INT` and `RFI`), four new instructions (`RMS`, `IIM`, `PIM`, `PMM`) and two new special registers (`UM` and `LM`). That might seem like a lot, but IMO it isn't really.\n\nI might code this up in a saturn branch and see how it goes.\n    ","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"To be fair, as described above, programming is involved in most 0x10c related discussions and appears like such a crucial game mechanic right now simply because it's the only thing we know for certain about the game (besides the face builder) and such a unique game concept. Many other significant cool sci-fi mechanics will emerge with time that are accessible to non-programmers, don't worry. \n\nProgramming also probably won't be needed in the game (copy-pasta should work for mostly everything seems to be the general consensus here), but it's fun/good to learn, for many practical even non-gaming related reasons. Assembly is a [simple and great programming language for any aspiring programmer to learn too](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/422613/what-are-the-practical-advantages-of-learning-assembly) (also see [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/82432/is-learning-assembly-language-worth-the-effort?rq=1)), yet is simple enough that with some dedication, [a good tutorial](http://0x10cforum.com/forum/m/4932880/viewthread/2730356-dcpu-tutorial-workinprogress), and [lots of goofing around with an emulator](http://dcpu.ru/) any beginner should be able to be up and running with DCPU programming in no time, relatively speaking. As a language, Assembly is so different than many other \"high level\" programming languages that it even throws experienced programmers for a loop when they first start learning it, but once you get the hang of it you'll realize it's not as bad it's sometimes touted to be. \n\nAlso, if you're a beginner programmer, don't worry about learning Assembly as being a waste of your time: once you learn the main programming concepts here, you'll find they transition pretty naturally into any other programming language, hence the phrase \"once you learn one programming language, you learn them all\". There are some notable exceptions (specifically Object Oriented Programming and other programming paradigms like Haskell that take a bit more tutorialing and just end up amazingly expanding your problem solving potential), but in general, these concepts will carry with you throughout the rest of your programming career.\n\nFinally, just remember, the reason the DCPU programming discussions and really any programming related discussions usually sound so complicated is just because they're using lots of programming terminology - the concepts themselves that are being discussed are actually pretty simple. As you start learning programming concepts, terminology, and problem solving skills through tutorials and most importantly just messing around with the emulators yourself, you'll begin to understand what people are talking about in discussions kinda intuitively you'll find.

Let's talk about the Out Of Memory errors that were introduced during beta.  In alpha, you could run Minecraft on a 32-bit installation of Windows with no problem what-so-ever.  After Notch decided to rewrite the engine (more on that later), he conveniently introduced those glaring OOM errors to anyone running a 32-bit Windows.  You know why they occured?  Well, if you tried to ask Notch or Jens back then, you got *nothing* but silence.  They either couldn't figure it out themselves or took the childish route of \"if I ignore it, it will go away\".  It occurred because they never, I repeat never, took efficiency of memory into account.  So they would just allocate and allocate memory until it crossed well past the 1 GB mark.  At which point, on 32-bit installations, you would get the Java OOM error.  So I can already hear your next excuse \"WAH, its Java!  Java manages the memory so it *can't* be my God's fault!\"  Well guess what, fuckface.  You don't have to hold on to your resources indefinitely!  You can release them so that the JVM can actually do it's fucking job and clean up unused resources.  But they didn't give a shit and funny enough, failed to mention this on their website.  It didn't specify that you needed a *64-bit* version of Windows to run the game more than 10 minutes.  So again, something glaring that really should have been taken care of before \"release\".\n\nBut let's talk of engine rewrites.  So Alpha is done which means you go to Beta to polish bugs, right?  Nope.  Notch decides he wants to *completely* just dump the old engine and rewrite a new one.  That is what introduced the lighting issue.  Did he even try to fix it?  Nope, just added to that looming technical debt.  Was that the only rewrite?  Nope.  Jens and Dinnerbone had to fucking rewrite the engine *again* (after the fucking RELEASE, mind you) just to get rid of **all that fucking technical debt** that Notch left them.  There were so many issues between SP and MP and Notch knew it.  There were many cases where he said himself that he should have written SP to use the MP engine.  All those bugs and issues that persisted well past his fake-ass \"release\" date.  Jens had to clean everything up recently.\n\nIf you don't think Minecraft had a slwe of bugs upon release then you are either a cultist or just a blatant idiot.  Maybe a little of both.  Probably.  Just count the amount of bugs fixed since release.  I bet it surpasses a couple hundred.\n\nBottom line, quit arguing with blinders on.  You are *that* guy who would say \"ITS BETA!\" if someone complained about a legitimate issue.  You are also *that* guy who, after beta, would just move on to the next excuse.  You never actually let blame fall where it was due.  You are the guy who will get burned repeated over and over by Notch, but never place blame.  He is your fucking Pop-Star.  Funny, though, since he keeps stringing you on and you keep taking it.  \n\nSay, how is that 0x10c coming along?  I heard that by now it was going to be some \"Grand MMO\" that they already had the pricing structure figured out for.  It was going to allow you to program your own TCP/IP protocols and all that.  Funny how Notch and Carl already had the reoccurring revenue part figured out *way* before they even knew what the game would do.  All they cared about was getting your money first.  They would figure out how to make it \"fun\" later.  Yeah, Notch is all about gaming.  Such as savior.  \n\nSo where is this game at anyways?  Oh yeah, I forgot;  Notch got *distracted* (once again, shocker) by Javascript of all things.  Why don't you downvoting douchebags look at my history here and see this is *exactly* what I predicted?  I said that Notch had the attention span of a walnut.  If it isn't something he can complete in 48 hours, it's not getting done.  r/Minecraft learned that.  r/MiniTales learned that.  You guys will too.\n\nEdit:  Hopefully made this comment easier on the eyes","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

Anyways, I am a Junior Computer Science and Software Engineering dual major. I've worked with Java, C#, and (very little) C++. Currently I am working on an indie Android game which I wrote using my own game 2D engine. About a year ago I worked on a voxel based game but abandoned the project for my current one. I have not really done any 3d or ever used an official game engine, but I understand the basics. I would say that I'm pretty good with random world generation aspects (I created an engine to generate a whole city map from scratch using a supplied seed, like Minecraft.) I could help with GUI work or anything backend like the world generator. I have also done some 2D AI work. I will say that I absolutely HATE doing art. I have a programmer mind, not an artist mind. I am a pretty busy person, but I would love to help with any small tasks that you may need. \n\nI must say though, with this many people contributing, we definitely  need some sort of structure to keep development smooth.

{"body":"I don't agree that the game needs to be DCPU centred for it to be sucessful... infact I think the opposite;\n\n* In order for the game to be playable outside a small elite of assembly programmers, it would probably need to come 'prepackaged' with DCPU programmes for those disinterested or incapable people to use. This will probably mean online repositories of DCPU code that can be downloaded and shared. \n\n* So how much game time is really going to be spent coding?... not much I think. The DCPU has to be a means to an end, not an end itself. What I mean by that is, the challenge of coding the DCPU is to achieve in-game player-set objectives. If you look at redstone as an analogy, its fun becasue people use it in ways it wasn't intended, to achieve ever more ambitious in-game objectives. For example, building a redstone powered enderman farm is fun because you can get XP and ender pearls which are useful in other aspects of the game... although building it might be fun, it isn't the be all and end all of the game. i.e you don't \"win\" minecraft when you build an enderman farm.\n\nI think Notch always intended 0x10c to be a sandbox game that included coding, not a DCPU focused game. Reading through his interviews and comments, I can't find a single sentence where he says anything to the contrary or ever depicts this as a DCPU focused game. I very much took it to be a sandbox space game, one component of which was the DCPU, much like minecraft is a sandbox block-based building game with a redstone circuitry component, among many others.\n\nEdit: I do agree that it's likely the DCPU will be the games main 'unique feature'... but how many games are entirely unique? Even minecraft isn't unique in that regard (its really just a better implementation of the infiniminer concept). The trick to 0x10c isn't a feature list of unique gameplay mechanics, but rather the implementation of those mechanics into something fun... and ironically that seems to be where they've got stuck.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

I think it has so much potential, to be a great game - but also to get people into coding by showing them how it can make tasks easier. I'm in my mid 20s now but I would have loved this when I was 15. Chances are if I'd got into programming then i'd be in a different job now. \n\nHaving said all that, I'm also realistic. This game is embryonic at best and it probably wouldn't take much to abort it at this early stage. This game is also arguably harder to develop than minecraft... a) because it is technically more complex due to the DCPU and b) because it will need to be more 'thrashed out' before it goes to public testing - as it risks being written off early as \"boring and hard\". \n\nMinecraft was lucky because it is such a basic sandbox that players could make what they wanted from it even at an early stage. I think this will be a sandbox to... but the fun will probably need to be a bit more laid out than it is in minecraft. \n\nSo when we will see 0x10c is anyones guess. I wouldn't be at all suprised if it didn't go into beta in 2013 - and to be honest I wouldn't really be that suprised if it got kicked into the long grass on perma-hold if things don't work out with it.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

Notch!\"* as I've said, I actually have a huge amount if admiration for notch.\n\nAgain, it's this whole fanboy thing - the guy made a popular game, he also flouts his life openly on the internet and isn't ashamed to use his fame when it suits him (like to bag an early release oculus rift or to .party() with celebrities). Fame is a two way street and you have to accept some honest criticism with it... Even if it is an uncomfortable truth.\n\nYou need to appreciate there is an at times subtle distinction between honest critique and a personal attack. I like notch, I'm not attacking the guy. I actually sympathise with what it must be like to have the weight of people's unreasonable expectations on you. Notch stopped 0x10c because the unrealistic expectations he helped create could not be reconciled with what was achievable -- not because of my honest and often sympathetic critique on reddit.

It would certainly make configuring an operating system boot disk a bit of a challenge if there were multiple kinds of hardware that needed to be supported.\n\nThe \"in-game\" explanation for seeing new hardware show up is that different people from different places... perhaps even different time eras could be showing up in the universe a trillek years later with only minor variations in the sleep chamber being responsible for why new people appear suddenly with new kinds of hardware.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

It sold very well despite having no ads, purely through word of mouth, and the effect of the community on general gamer culture. I imagine that when your customers are selling your game themselves, the name has very little to do with uptake. \n\nSince you're not having to capture someone's attention in a small advert, you don't need a punchy self explanatory title. If your fans are selling your game, it's probably going to be in the context of a more in depth conversation, or in a piece of culture where there's a video, meme or interesting screenshot of the game.\n\n[edit]\n\nI also actually like the title by the way, it's original, references its nerd roots, and is a nice counterpoint to modern games that have titles like 'Primordia', 'Karateka', 'Miasmata' (catchy, easy to pronounce, but ultimately forgettable).\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

All I'm suggesting is letting the game itself be written in a higher order language, and C# seems like a good choice due to its familiarity to C++/Java/JavaScript Developers (they share paradigms).  Writing the whole game in C++ will make it potentially harder to utilise volunteers as the skill set is rarer.\n\nOf course with Mono you could write in VB, C# and F# there are also OS compilers for Java.

{"body":"Like Saerain said, alternatively you could use something like 6 32 bit numbers: Three for the 3D sector position (probably integers) and three for the 3D position in the sector you're currently in (probably floats or some decimal approximation like that). Each sector could be as big as the position numbers could handle, and then you'd end up with coordinates like, say: I'm in quadrant (3,4,5) at position (14034, 393, 492). It'd still be harsh, but at least a bit more manageable if we were really doing such a large scale thing.\n\nMaybe if you wanted to do what koppeh said, too, these \"sector coordinates\" of sorts could be given from nearby \"sensor bases\" or \"radio towers\" or something that's set up at planets nearby - where you'd be told more accurate coordinates relative to the towers the closer you are to the planet and the bigger the sensor is, where the \"bigger and betterness\" could be dependent on like how much resources you pumped into it or something. Something like this would be fun too, as the \"deep space\" areas would be much more risky as autopilot wouldn't really work, while more settled areas would be much more practical for transporting expensive stuff and working with others at thousands of miles an hour.\n\nAlso, alternatively for the sector system (although I guess these two could work together in theory), if this was implemented in the game it might allow the bonus of some sort of ownership of sectors - if anything just so if you possess the main planet or the \"globe\" or something in that sector you get to name it - or possibly even start linking up portals to places that your friends/clan or something own - or just show the name of the place to anyone that enters. But now this is just speculative and off-topic so I should probably say never-mind for now, till we see what goes.\n\ntl;dr Sectors would be fun, and be more manageable for transferring coordinates and knowing where you are.

{"body":"It is a working space game, but in my opinion it wouldn't fit the theme of the game. 0x10^c was built around the dcpu, from what I can tell, so it fit quite well.\n\nIn pioneer alpha you can't walk around, so you won't be able to interact with anything. You could just have the dcpu be a window. The lack of multiplayer could be a problem too, one of the big things about 0x10^c was that it was supposed to let players trade programs in the game. If it was in pioneer alpha you would be the only one with a computer, the rest would only be AIs.\n\nIf done right I guess it could fit pioneer nicely.

In this way it's different from minecraft, where once the basic mechanics of the game are done (block placing and destruction), the game is a game, fun to play, and adding more features is optional (though most will improve said game). For a game like 0x10c, however, without enough different mechanics, like say space exploration *and* DCPU programming, or whatever, the game isn't complete enough to be fun or useful, other than for the purposes of debugging and adding new features, what notch is (hopefully continuing to) do.

Their first concern is creating a game that is fun and playable to start with.  Yes, there is something first persony that Notch has shown to be working, but that's just a in-office prototype to get a feel of the general art and structure of the ships (which is a very small part of the game), but that is not releasable to the public/community yet, because it's far from representable of the entire game.\n\nDevelopment-wise, what we have seen of 0x10^c is the equivalent of the very [first video of Minecraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9t3FREAZ-k). The general style is set, but the game is nothing more than a prototype.\n\n&gt;We could develop some kind of infrastructure for landing space craft for example\n\nWhy should we do this? There isn't even a game to speak of. The ships can't move yet, let alone dock with a space station. If you want to start programming with the DCPU there is a subreddit (/r/dcpu16) dedicated to that, but that doesn't guarantee the programs you write for that will eventually work in the final game...\n&gt;a good amount of the bug fixes for it were done by the community\n\nYes, that's true, that's why Minecraft is releasing weekly snapshots...

{"body":"My spec was offered as a counterpoint to yours, not as an attempt to fit into it. Where your spec addresses what must be written on media in peripherals to be recognized by the boot ROM, I want access to write the boot ROM itself.  \n  \nPerhaps a real world example would clarify. An SOC I work with has code burned into it internally that will be run when it first starts up. This code checks up on things, then tries to find some bootable media. If it can't find any, it attempts to setup a USB connection to a flashing program. This isn't hardware magic, its code. (You can even read it later, it never leaves the physical memory map! It starts at 0x98000) What you have proposed is a small version of this \"burnt in code.\" Sometimes I wish I could change that code, but it is set in stone as the chip is made. I don't want the DPCU locked to the same thing.  \n  \nThe spec I gave lets you change that internal \"burnt in\" code. You don't need to have a predetermined magic value in your floppy image. You can write the code that looks for the magic value in media yourself. Maybe there isn't even any magic values and it just uses the first floppy drive?

And whilst minecraft is very popular, and they have a lot of money now - there will eventually come a time where people don't buy minecraft anymore and their funds are dwindling... and games take years to develop so it would be unwise to wait for that to happen - so they might aswell pump cash into 0x10c, which is why I can't understand why the aren't hiring people by the trainload to work on it. \n\nThe real question is are Mojang the exception to the rule - or are they in the process of totally changing the classic industry model from production studio/publisher to a indie-dev/web release model.... scrolls is a cute but niche game, with limited appeal so it probably won't be the decider.

He may not be the president/CEO of the company dealing with the day to day decisions, but he still is heavily involved with long-range planning of the company.  Running off to various conventions, press conferences, and other activities where he credited as \"founder\" still chews up a bunch of time (even if it may be fun as well).\n\nDevelopment of 0x10^c also didn't need to be so public.  That was a conscious decision on the part of Notch where he did everything necessary to really build hype for the game.  That it never got beyond a very simple prototype (not even \"alpha stage\"), but the livestream demos, \"leaked prototypes\" released, and talking about the game to various game journal reporters certainly didn't help to quiet things down.\n\nI keep hoping that perhaps Notch will decide to hand this game off to somebody else (like Dinnerbone) even if he doesn't want to continue.  Either that or try to work on it in relative obscurity where a beta version will be released after everybody else has ignored the game and moved on (in an effort to quiet down the hype).

Why not just name it something else? Why even use the DCPU? There are tons of well established CPU specs out there, some very similar to the DCPU.\n\nI would also point out that the DCPU is slightly special... because whilst you guys are treating it as a programmable CPU spec (which clearly it is), it's actually also a peice of in-game lore, developed specifically by a games company for this purpose and this purpose alone. So I don't think looking to ARM, AMD or Intel for a case history is necessarily giving the entire picture. It is for this reason I am talking about copyright issues, not patents.\n\nSo whilst you might feel okay using the instruction set from another CPU... would you feel okay making a game whose main character was called James Bond, 007, whose trademark weapon was a Walther PPK...

{"body":"I'm not sure anyone but Notch can answer that question yet. But what I would say, is looking at the hardware specifications already available (DCPU, monitor, keyboard, 3D vector projector, sleep cell, floppy drive) it seems like that the output devices (e.g. monitor) are relatively simple in operation... therefore the goal is to interconnect those devices effeciently - rather than to make those individual devices effecient. E.g. you won't have to make your 3D projector refresh faster - but you wil have to effeciently connect it to your DCPU.\n\nI suspect there will be more to 0x10c than just the DCPU though. For example the gathering/processing/crafting of resources could be a huge 'sub-game' in itself. There may also be many variantions on the ships hardware with varying stats, for example perhaps some engines are faster than others - but draw more power.\n\nPersonally, I think it would preferable if outputs and inputs are simpler. Otherwise there will become a single 'best' way of maximising a certain device - and once that method is known everyone will copy-paste it. But if the trick is balancing ship systems - and ship systems vary in a number of 'stats' then its less about doing it the \"best\" way and more about doing it \"your way\".\n\nFor example a fighting ship might want to focus on whatever the defensive/shield type stat is. But in doing so, they might have to sacrafice the speed stat. How they balance those stats (using both the combination of devices and the DCPU code to control them) will be what makes the game variable.\n\nOtherwise it will simply be a case of logging into a DCPU code repository, downloading whatever the cookie-cutter 'best' DCPU-Operating System is and installing it - regardless of the characteristics of your ship.\n\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

I'm sure we will see lots of open source scripts that will help non programmers to use some options of the dcpu.\n\nYou idea sounds interesting, but it has at least one weak spot: The guy with the fastest computer wins (or the guy with the smartest code maybe). I can't really imagine a system where a computer has full control over a ship and humans could still stand a chance, given the kind of battle situations we see normally in such games (that is: the outcome of a fight mostly depending on speed of reaction Elite style). Maybe if you could make it a kind of RTS with to many options in any situation for an ai to handle humans would stand a chance.\n\nSo one reason for the limited dcpu was to make it possible for a reasonable amount of servers to offer (and limit) the processing power to be equal for all players. Otherwise it's like having a MMORPG or FPS where you make bots legal.\n\nNext thing: Where to find the player community? There have been (simple) AI contest like games before. None of them (to my knowledge) managed to gain a constant player base.\n\nSo I would really like to see a game somewhat as you describe it, where human players and AI controlled (or humans aided by AI) could compete.

Setting up opportunities for \"triangular trade\" really helps in getting trade routes being established, which from a game design viewpoint requires multiple sinks and sources of materials... and making it difficult (through either multiple processes or few locations for some sources) to obtain that material.\n\nThe real limited resource in the game will likely be energy, so it seems like a kilowatt-hour will likely become a standard unit of currency.

A flight simulator would be another example of this in the game, where you could have \"recruits\" to some alliance try out different scenarios before they get into \"real\" combat.\n\nOn the whole it wouldn't be all that complicated as it would still be using the same game engine with just some \"escapes\" to jump out of the simulator and back into the \"real world\" and a separate universe database for the content inside of the simulator.  Walking into the holodeck would be essentially like going through a portal in Minecraft where you would end up in a Skyblock type universe that could be arbitrarily expanded in a \"creative mode\" setup.  The \"arch\" would be the portal you would use to \"get back\".\n\nThen again multidimensional travel has caused all sorts of headaches in Minecraft too.

{"body":"I've been thinking about this more, and I really like the idea of moving the ship with the DCPU, even small distances. \n\nImagine begining, stranded in space, on a ship with nothing but an underclocked 80s computer to get you going. You start by programming a few lines of simple code to land you on the nearest planet. Down there you can gather a few resources to build some sensors... Then you can plug those into your DCPU to improve control over the ship, so now you can dock with a local space station. There you can sell some rocks you mined and buy a more powerful engine or some 'construction items' to expand your ship.\n\nFar from being a typical PC-game spaceship (with sleek controls and futuristic weapons) this is a big, clumsy, antique. The ability to code its computer effeciently would be central to turning it into something useful. Simple things like docking two ships, landing on a planet, or pointing your ships cannon towards an enemy ship could end up being hugely complicated tasks.\n\nBut, just like building a 3 x 3 piston door in minecraft... you'll get more satisfaction and pride from docking two spaceships together than you ever will from destroying a whole enemy fleet in a blaze of anti-aliased graphics in a game like Eve Online.\n\nBut what if you're 13 and you can't code for toffee? No problem... copy-paste someone elses DCPU code from the web to get started. There will probably end up being a whole community of DCPU coders. When I think back about how I learnt to code, it was always by copying, adapting and then improving on other peoples work to suit my needs.

{"body":"Assembly languages don't actually operate with strings or any kind of high-level objects. Each individual command usually can operate with one byte or word, etc. So your idea of \"adding value of I to the end of the string\" is nonsense. Why the brackets? One of the main concepts about low level assembly languages is \"addressing modes\". \"String\" is a label, and label is actually an address in memory. \"[String]\" means value at address \"String\". Note that \"String\" is not a variable - it is a constant. So when compiled the address that \"String\" points to gets hard-coded into machine codes. Various assembly commands can support different addressing modes. For example [String + I] is an indexed addressing mode, which means \"value at address (String + I)\". So if we make a label pointing to our string and loop through it with I register we can get each individual character using this addressing mode. If you refer to DCPU specs sheet (http://dcpu.com/dcpu-16/), you will find all of the supported addressing modes for the commands. All assemblers designed for DCPU should comply to these specs.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

If someone merely disagrees, if they say \"I feel that the game should have been more complete before they called the release anything other than a beta\", then I will say \"I agree for the most part, but given the nature of a sandbox title where the full version will still have features added to it the same way, I am not too bothered.\" If you say \"Notch is a awful game developer and you can't see that because you are part of his CULT!\" (Especially with the repeated allcaps) then no discussion will he had.\n\nI call people \"kid\" when they cannot talk like an adult. You imagine that since I like Notch even though Minecraft has bugs that have never effected me in all my time playing, I must be some kind of obsessed cultist. This seems to me like a form of projection: you are SO offended that an independant developer isn't conformong to your expectations, that a game developer can make mistakes to to some level of difficiency in his ability, that your only option is to seethe at him, to hate him. So when you see someone with measured appreciation, who sees these minor shortcomings as completely expectable drawbacks to an independant game, you assume it must be that I must have some unwavering devotion.\n\n\nKid, 0x10c hasn't even made it to the point where they are offering a playable build. They are *just talking about and developing the idea*, and you think thats some horrible sin. You didn't hear that it would be some \"grand mmo\" by now from them  for sure. When the heck did anyone give any kind of a timescale?\n\nThat sentiment, this idea that you are somehow entitled to having the game further in development than it is *just because they announced development of it* is exactly why I am calling you \"kid\". No one has even paid for a beta for it yet, and you think that we should have the game already? What a joke.\n\nYou are going to blow this off as \"making excuses\" probably, because you have incredibly unreasonable expectations of the variety I usually hear from middle schoolers whose only experience in game development is click to create or some other program. \"Why does it take so long to get a game made, I can make games in an hour?\"\n\nGrow up.

{"body":"First of all, wait. there's *plenty* of time before this game is released in any way shape or form. Second, this game's not just going to be about coding, but also exploring the dead universe, colonizing planets, ship-based warfare, trading, pirating, and who knows what else. A subset of these features is likely to make it into the first release ([not alpha](https://twitter.com/notch/status/288756930674061312)). By the [far away time](https://twitter.com/notch/status/293088948622868480) it's actually released, we can hope for at least some of those features mentioned. Thirdly, actually programming the DCPU isn't actually that hard. You can get the hang of it fairly quickly, looking at the [manual](http://dcpu.com), working through a [simple tutorial](http://0x10cwiki.com/wiki/Assembly_beginner%27s_guide), and then doing some *very* simple things, like adding 2 + 2 . I recommend [this emulator](http://dcpu-ide.com); it works well, has convenient debugging features for later, and is pleasant to use. It's not that hard. Also check out the [dcpu subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/dcpu16).\n\nTo answer your other questions, in a game with a significant focus on dcpu programming, it would be nice to be proficient with programming, but not essential.

Its like when you go to draw something that is going to take weeks -- you dont just launch into it with your best paints... you draw a few sketches, play around with different colours, try various types of paper etc. Only once you've done those things do you choose a final style and THEN you draw it out for real. \n\nThis Notch prototype is basically akin to fucking around on a piece of scrap paper... He even said himself he was never actually sure what code language the final game would even be written in -- and indeed they had these various proof of concept programmes in both C# and Unity. It's almost certain **not one line of that code would ever have made it into the final game**.\n\nIf these guys want to make 0x10c they'd be better off thinking about what their end goals actually are (i.e. what the game will include - something that Notch never managed) and then working back from there - you can get plenty of free to use 3D engines/libraries with physics support from code repositories... virtually all of them are orders of magnitude more advanced than this 'prototype'. Then you would just need to implement the game specifics and the DCPU. i.e. a lot of the work would actually be in producing 3D models, textures and just polishing and fleshing out the code from a free engine. Obviously if you wanted to make the MMO concept then you'd also need to develop a server backend to support emulation of the DCPU and some kind of in-game database.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

Where did you get all that from. \n\nI have a lot of admiration for Notch, not just for his one popular game Minecraft, but more so for his genuine honesty when it comes to both the games industry and nerd-life in general.\n\nBut I can tell you flat out, if you wanted to make a game of this scope, you would be looking at hiring ~60 staff, with a lead time of several years and you would need some serious financial backing. 2 guys were never going to make this as a side project and you we're kidding yourself if you thought it would happen like that.\n\nI also recognise that while Minecraft is **very** innovative, Notch does not deserve the complete credit for it that he quite often gets attributed. Much of the actual coding work was done by Jens Bergensten and later Nathan Adams. The games concept itself is largely derivative of infiminer and the way it became so popular so quickly was mostly about *being in the right place at the right time*... i.e. technology had just become good enough to start filming live gameplay with spare CPU/GPU power and streaming it online (the emergence of Lets Plays). The fact Minecrafts system requirements were low and it had high-replayability made it the perfect testbed for LP videos and led to it becoming so popular. Coupled with the direct-to-consumer download model minecraft has enjoyed a lot of financial and popular success... and Notch deserves a lot of credit for that... but he doesn't deserve all of it. It was as much a combination of a good idea, luck, other peoples help and being in the right place at the right time. This idea that everything Notch touches turns to gold is the communities own fantasy - and is not born out in reality.\n\nGames like FTL, Rodina, Space station 13 etc. all include elements similar to 0x10c's potential gameplay, and they are a much more accurate example of the kind of thing that can realistically be achieved by 2 guys.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"To answer your question, my system could not display 384 different characters on the screen at once, and neither can yours (though it can display more). This is, however, generally not encountered, especially if programs are designed to avoid it. It is physical problem with the hardware, which though neither of us actually solve, both mitigate, in different ways.\n\n\nWhat I think you're saying is that, assuming that remapping the screen font alters existing characters (a reasonable assumption, with which I agree), it is not possible to display at any given time more than the number of characters in the screen font. Changing the functionality of the screen by adding a 256 character mode would double the number of unique characters that could be displayed on the screen at any one time. Even with this 256 character mode (which is a fine idea), it would *still* not be possible to display 384 *unique* characters on the screen at any given moment in time. \n\nNow a more detailed description of both systems, as I understand them, and their advantages and drawbacks.\n\n**My System** (remapping font buffer)\n\n* Works by: When a character needs to be displayed on the screen which is not currently in the font loaded onto the screen's font, it remaps a new font to the screen, which contains the new character. The DCPU keeps track of what characters are currently loaded, and in what index. \n\n* Advantages: **No modifications to spec necessary**  \nCan be used to display an arbitrarily large character set, with many uncommonly used symbols, but see limitations.  \nCan be abstracted into the OS/driver.\n  \nRequires *no change* to the existing hardware/specifications; done all in software. \n\n* Limitations: Assuming limitations of screen set forth earlier, it cannot display more than 128 different characters at once. This is fine for most scripts in most non-edge cases. Even if a character set contains more than 128 characters *total*, generally less than all 128 of them will be in use at the same time, because some will likely be used more than once (like space, the latin 'e', '.' or whatever). \n\nDepending on how long the screen hardware ends up taking to do a font remap, it could drag performance slightly in some circumstances. It is quite optimizeable, however, eg. by kicking out the least used character out of the font, or combining font remaps together when more than one character needs to be changed (eg by waiting a second before remapping the font, to see if more changes need to be made at the same time--more useful if it is the computer writing to the screen) \n\n* Summary: Allows an arbitrarily large number of different characters to be displayed by the screen, just not all at once. The heavy work can be abstracted away into OS/Driver calls and stuff.\n\n\n**Your System** (expanded native screen character size to 8 bits)\n\n* Works by: Changing hardware spec so that, by whatever means (including HWI to change modes), the screen can accept longer characters. \n\nThis would allow a static font twice as big as currently, and (if using a static font system) twice as many accessible characters, and (if using a dynamic font system) would allow twice as many different characters to be displayed on the screen at a single time.\n\n* Advantages: Doubles the number of different characters which can be displayed on the screen at one time. If using in conjunction with my system (dynamic font remapping) allows greater number of different characters on screen, and more infrequent remapping. \n\nIf programmer is working with raw direct hardware assembly, *without an OS*, then it might need less code, or be slightly easier to program. With an OS handling interactions with the screen, however, you could simply tell the screen driver or whatever to print character 372 at 4, 7, and it would deal with the remapping of the *actual* fint as necessary by itself. \n\n* Limitations: **Modifies original spec.** Does not allow for more than 256 different characers, period. Also removes blink capability. modified hardware likely not available (Notch likes simplicity)\n\n* Summary: With modification of accepted hardware spec, allows more characters to be displayed by the screen. By itself it is useful, and in conjunction with dynamically remapping the font, makes a very nice solution.\n\n\n**Combined System** (dynamic font remapping, with 8-bit characters)\n\n* Works by: Same as my system, except with Gareth's 8-bit characers\n\n* Advantages: All those present in my system, *plus* decreased need for remapping (characters are more likely to be present in the screen-font, as it is larger), and therefore increased performance. Limitation on maximum number of different characters possible to display on the screen at once higher.\n\n* Limitations: can still only display 256 different characters on the screen at once, **Modifies Spec**, removes blink.\n\n* Summary: Clearly the best of both worlds, if available hardware can support it. (likely not)\n\n\nClearly, the optimal solution is an OS/driver handled font remapping system, with or without 8-bit screen-characters. Clearly, in some circumstances, a 8-bit font would be necessary (eg. displaying 200 different characters on the screen at once), and in some (eg. displaying 300 different characters on the screen at once) would even be insufficient. With the dynamic font system, fonts can have arbitrarily long character sets, even without 8-bit characters, and with, things are easier for the OS/driver.\n\nWorking with 8-bit characters on the screen as opposed to 7-bit ones would be great, and make many things better.  I would love a screen with the capabilities you mentioned. We don't have that, though, and my solution provides an interesting workarount, more capeable than simply allowing more screen-native characters. If you wanted more than 256 characters anyway,  you would still need something like what I proposed. If it can be abstracted away from even the assembly programmer, much more interesting things can be done. And finally, it provides the only solution to the problem of being able to type any one of thousands of different characters. even with the current screen, as long as most of the characters are somewhat common. The screen doesn't need to support 50000 different characers, just the OS/driver needs to know how to remap them into the font of the screen as needed/\n\nThe challenge is writing software to deal with limitations in the hardware, which must be taken as immutable. Finally, a challenge.\n\n\n\nI would love to have screen hardware capable of supporting 8-bit characters (your idea). Even without that, it would be possible to achieve an illusion of an arbitrarily large font by remapping it as necessary.  \n\nBoth systems are useful in their own right, and combined become even more powerful.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"If you have a room of any kind and you want to teleport around in it, no matter how you subdivide it(sectors, coordinates, polar coordinates, whatever) every location to which you can teleport will have to be identified by some unique bit pattern. If n is the number of bits we have available, s is the volume of the universe and r is the density of which teleportable locations are placed (for example 0.5 per cubic meter), you can write\n\ns=(2^n )/r\n\nIf we have 16 bits and want to have a teleportable location for every 10 cubic meters, that means the universe can be (2^16 )/0.1 = 655.360 cubic meters. That is quite a big room, but on an astronomical scale it is not really that much. Of course you can decrease the density of locations by a factor of ten or two (or three or four) and still get pretty good coverage, but you will still be far far away from getting a universe the size of anything remotely the size of the earth.\n\nAdding sectors does not solve this problem, since as i have said, no matter what kind of notation you use to represent the locations, every single one will need a unique bit pattern.\n\nThe most efficient way to get a bigger universe is to allow for more bits(since that increases the size exponentially). We could use one 16 bit number for each of the x, y and z coordinates for instance. That would give us 48 bits. (2^48 )/0.1 =(approx) 2.8*10^13 cubic metres. Still not close to the size of the earth( which is about 10^23 according to wolframalpha).\n\nSo if we use two 16 bit numbers for each coordinate. (2^96 )/0.1 = 7.9*10^29. This is an area about 700-800 times larger than the sun. That is big but still no where near the size of the universe.\n\nIf you double the amount of bits again. That is 4 * 16 bits for every coordinate x, y and z. You start to get somewhere. Now we have a volume of about 6.3*10^58 . That is... really really big. But on an astronomical scale it is only the size of a smaller galaxy according to this Wikipedia page(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(volume))\n\nThat page also tells us that the observable universe is about 10^80 cubic meters. That means we will need about 264 bits, which divided into 3 coordinates is 88 per coordinate. Divided into 16 bit numbers, that is 5.5 16 bit numbers per coordinate.\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

The predictions are then rerun up to the currrent game clock and the multiplayer object is rubber banded.

{"body":"Ok, so, I've been reading the proposals here... here's my two cents:\n\n \u00b7 The game should drop the MMO features, we should aim for minecraft-like client-server multiplayer. \n\n \u00b7 Notch was always afraid of remaking Minecraft, but I think we should still heavily rely on voxel-based structures and worlds. My idea is that both ships and planets should be pretty much completely destructible. We should also aim to have as diverse, interesting planets as possible.\n\n \u00b7 We should definitely support more than one player on a ship. We should make it so that bigger ships need more players to control the weapons etc., a bit like Guns of Icarus Online. It'll also be interesting to balance the power and size of large ships with the maneuvrabilty of smaller ships.\n\n \u00b7 We definitely need to have customizable characters whose heads follow the way the mouse is pointing like Minecraft. That adds a lot to the immersion in multiplayer.\n\n \u00b7 Since we are in space, we can afford to have large empty spaces with some asteroids, space stations, etc. in between. That should save us a bit of processing power while making the universe feel big.\n\n \u00b7 The DCPU is an interesting component of the game, but it's a very complicated one. Someone more experienced than me might have some good ideas for it, but I think we should simplify its concept, otherwise it might be hard to implement. I think we should have a \"Ship API\" and allow everyone to build programs with some scripting language, so that the less technical people don't feel left out. We should also have some sort of internet module and a \"plugin shop\", where people can buy other people's programs with in-game currency.\n\n \u00b7 After we've got the basis laid out, we should think about AIs and what kind of enemies, NPCs and encounters we would want to see in the game. But that can come later.\n\n \u00b7 Finally, something that in my opinion is VERY important: the game should be cross-platform FROM THE START. Otherwise we'll leave out a good chunk of players and porting the game later will be a nightmare. We should target Win-Mac-Linux from the start.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"&gt; Not having to look at a bunch of extra cruft is a big advantage of dynamic typing.  \n\nPersonally I think writing the code is much harder in dynamically typed languages because you are unable to see the run-time type across methods. For instance if you write a function where you expect a type of parameter, the IDE can only infer the type in certain instances.  \n\nC++ and C# also support type inference which removes what you call \"cruft\". You'll define the variables exactly as you would in a dynamic language, except it's still statically typed. \n    \nC++ :\n\n    auto a = 5;\n\nC# :\n\n    var a = 5;\n\nbut without the huge waste of resources which is dynamic typing.\n\nC# also actually supports dynamic typing : \n\n    dynamic a = { test : 4 };\n\nin addition to its static typing.\n\n\n&gt; Anyway I was suggesting that you simulate everything on the peers since that is much more scalable and the only reason you are doing it on the server is to thwart the occasional cheater which you will need a strategy to handle that even if everything is simulated on the server. This is not a traditional approach but if you can think for yourself then breaking with tradition often makes sense such as in this case.\n\nI'm not sure, it opens up for a lot of malicious intent, potential bottlenecks and firewall issues. How would you know which client sits with the correct and most updated information? After all every action will have to traverse the entire swarm. I see many issues, and the only benefit would be the operational cost on servers..?\nI'd see how this would be beneficial for some game made by people who aren't actually investing anything other than money into it, but for the people who intend to play the game, a distributed server system would be in my opinion a better approach.\n\n&gt; I used to do quite a lot of C++ programming many years ago. It just doesn't make sense anymore because hardware is fast and the newer tools and languages are just much better from a software engineering standpoint.  \n\nJust because you have hardware to spare doesn't mean that it's appropriate to treat it like it's worthless. I'm a huge advocate of statically typed languages on web servers, because it means that you can use the same piece of hardware to server ten times as many requests per second. Economically and quality-wise it's a no-brainer; the server costs will be lower and the response time will be reduced - it's a win-win for everyone. And all you have to do is just learn how to differentiate between data types, which you should be doing in dynamically typed languages anyway.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"      I was most exited for the idea of a circuit board designer. The free creation of machines and ship systems would make the game unique and infinitely interesting.\n\n\nHere's an example of the sort of thing is that I hope to be possible in the final game.\n\n\n      Think of sitting at a work bench on your ship, docked to a trading station. \nTransport vessels and freighters loom past your window, casting shadows over \nyour work. All of them full of players. You draw the last solder connection and \nsave the board to the server. You switch over to assembly mode and fit your \nnewly made final component into an advanced laser guided missile. \nIts run you a couple thousand and taken hours to design, but now you have your \nown precision missile that's 100% unique to you. Nobody knows how to jam its signal, \nnobody knows its flight patterns. And its time to go have some copies built for \nyour arsenal. You load the two meter missile onto a cargo cart and wheel it out \nof your ship. Rolling down the hall you pass other player's hauling goods of every size. \nYou reach a medium replicator station where you pay for five copies. You and your \nfriends take the now numerous crates back down a long corridor, looking for the \nairlock number you docked to. Reaching your ship, you load each missile into a \nrack. Your now ready to try and salvage some debris in a notoriously pirate laden \nasteroid belt. You programmed your misses to fly serpentine and avoid obstacles, \nthey wont know what hit them.\n\n\n      I cannot stress enough how satisfying loot and cargo of any kind is when \nits an actual object and not just an icon and number in a menu. The ability to \ncreate anything with at least some degree of realism would be the real selling \npoint of the game. You probably remember the circuit board designer idea from \na few months ago. If each board could be saved to the server as a simple \n16x16 or so bitmap, it wouldn't be very taxing. Assembly and construction \ncould be similar to how Wiremod works in the old Garry's-mod. The board and \nassembly of whatever device or system doesn't need to be simulated in real-time. \nIn a massively multi-player game this would be impossible. Instead all of your solder \nconnections, wires, and chips, could be compiled quickly into one simple code and \nrun with ease. The entire machine (Ex: The missile.) Can be treated as one simple \nobject with that code applied. Even simplified this much, it may be to expensive to \nprocess in real-time at that scale.\n\n\n      This is what I dream of when I imagine this game. I hope this serves as inspiration \nto you Notch. I am a game developer as well and I understand much of what I talked \nabout is far more complex in practice.  But few good games where easy to make. \nMechanical construction, circuit design, and DCPU are the strongest game-play \nelements so far, please build off of these.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

If you're going to write about anything I'd suggest a purely speculative piece on what the loss of direct leadership means for any community and make some recommendations about how the 0x10c community should conduct themselves or more importantly how they shouldn't be conducting themselves.\n\nIf anyone is going to take 0x10^c seriously now they'd be wise to get a few things straight. You need leadership. If you want this to be a community-drive project you need to establish a non-profit business because you're going to need money and you're not going to get it from anyone but Venture Capitalists or Kickstarter unless you're an official non-profit. Someone needs to assume the role of executive and build an entire committee specifically to direct the community. I'd suggest a passive approach: provide useful suggestions, direction and specifications but do not specifically develop this project yourselves. That is a job for another community entirely. That's the only way you'll even be able to focus on establishing what it is you're actually doing. The people who actually do the coding might not want to listen to you, you have to be ready for that. Further still the DCPU-16 crowd needs to distance themselves from the development of 0x10^c's spin-offs so they can keep focus on what's important to them.\n\nSomeone needs to focus specifically on providing guidance for the DCPU community as a complete separate development body. Hammer out the specs, allow individual movement to adopt it royalty-free, maintain it, etc. This effort should be entire separate from the game itself which should only use a specific, pre-determined implementation of a specific release of the DCPU specification. Consider releasing an actual, physical DCPU-16 for use as a standalone MCU or for integration with Arduino, Cortex M3, Raspberry Pi, PICmicro, etc ...\n\n0x10^c was a highly ambitious undertaking so it shouldn't be surprising that it was shelved. Developing a CPU is a project meant for gigantic semiconductor companies like Intel and AMD. Writing an OS is a undertaking only worthy of some of the largest and riches corporations in the world (Microsoft, Apple, Oracle, etc). Writing an MMO is equality sophisticated, expensive and problematic especially to run as a service. Who's going to pay for the Data Center you'd need to run this game as an MMO. I'm not even sure if Notch is that rich ... Rolling it all into one product is nothing short of insane if you really think about it. \n\nIt's a total clusterfuck. No one will want to admit it but what you're going to get is a spectrum of dissenters such as people like me who don't want to see anyone in control of this project other than Notch. This is anarchy at best and a viscous power struggle between numerous egotistical fascist dictatorships all competing for a vacancy that doesn't exist.\n\nThen there's the fact that someone is going to see an actual market for this game and try to assume the role of profiteer ... if this is going to be an MMO someone needs to pay for the server space and that someone isn't going to do it for free.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

It usually is restricted to mechanical engineering ideas (aka a really unique idea for how a machine does something), but patenting ideas is exactly what it means to have a patent issued.\n\nSoftware patents are especially ugly because that is only what they do.  For example, the infamous LZW patent that Unisys bashed over everybody's head was over the idea of using a specific kind of data compression that was particularly effective and unfortunately used in a common data format (the GIF image format) where the developers of that data format thought the idea was in the public domain.... but it wasn't.\n\nThe idea of a space-based game using the DCPU is novel enough that I think it could potentially be patentable.  That is the real key as you need to demonstrate that the concept has never been used before by anybody else (no prior art) or even described by somebody else.  Patent offices are particularly awful as they have been granting patents on concepts that have been widely used in the past (like granting a patent on the use of the ROT-13 encryption algorithm), and in general I think it is very hard to prove professionally that a particular software concept has never been used or demonstrated previously.\n\nSimply speaking, you are flat out wrong that a patent isn't about ideas.  That is all a patent is about.

{"body":"I could see 3 different types of voice-chat appearing.\n\nFirstly, basic local voice-chat. As long as you're in an area with an atmosphere your voice can be heard by anybody nearby and the volume decreases with distance until its inaudible.\n\nSecondly, a basic local radio system. Powered by ambient heat/light so there's no concern for powering it, and it's built into everybody's starter-suits. If we can take off the suits then we can have a radio inventory item. Tune to a certain frequency and speak, used for talking across medium-distances, like an engineer in the back of the ship chatting it up with the pilot in the front. Can be jammed by EMPs which'll cripple the communications between crewmates, giving the attackers a tactical advantage because the affected party then has to rely on local chat.\n\nThirdly, long-range radio for ship-to-ship, planet-to-ship, and *maybe* planet-to-planet communications. You'd need a dish for it, say about a half of a meter in diameter, which you'd put on your space-station or ship. You'd then program the DCPU to broadcast the input from the microphone as output via the dish, and it'd also collect input from the dish and play it back on the computer. You could hook the dish up to speakers throughout the deck to allow other people to hear the communications.\n\nSeems to me like it'd be a cool way of going about it, with simplicity for basic tasks and unskilled players while advanced players who would need long-range radio would probably be advanced enough to build a radio or at least hire someone who'd build it for them.\n\nWho knows, we could even use the long-range radio for radio stations.\n\n\"This is 182 FM, *The Rock*, broadcasting soft, smooth rock 'n' roll across the solar system for 140 years!\"","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"I was in the Runescape-cheating community for a long time, and I did program a lot of software for that specific purpose. There was an API we could develop under, or we could make our own additions - ofcourse, within limitation of the data we could get from the client. \n \n\n\nThis scenario is pretty close to what 0x10^c offers. In that community there were tons of people who liked programming, and wrote awesome scripts. Of course they started sharing them and selling them, and this resulted in the final game (Runescape) having a large load of the AI running around. So as a legitimate player, it was easy to trick these AI because they all had the same flaws. Each AI would also be in a bad position, because it always had competitors with the exact same code! Therefore, each AI would not accomplish much. As a side note, JaGeX (the company that runs Runescape) also recognizes all of these same AI, and it's fast for them to ban you from the game - another reason for not using that popular free and wide-used AI.\n\n \nHere's where I come into the story. I like programming, and that kind of AI was really fun to do, because of the environment. You were essentially writing a robot to function in a world, but the world could not know that it was indeed a robot. You had to be clever, and sneaky. Whenever I wrote some code, it would never be similar to the de-facto standard in woodcutting procedures. My personal AI would not share flaws with all the other AI's, and it would make decisions based on other things, or even based on the chance that the popular AI could be present. This way, I benefited a lot from writing my own code, even though it wasn't necessarily as flexible or effecient as the popular code was supposed to be (NOTE: In this particular instance, overused code would end up being less effective than code only used by my single AI, due to crowding). \n \n \nEven in Minecraft multiplayer mods, this principle holds water. If you know how to program yourself, there is not a limit to what you can do, and how you achieve that. If you rely on software other people wrote, you could very well just be buried in the masses and easily stepped over. It's not necessarily about writing better code, but writing code that achieves the goal in it's own way. \n","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"Well, here's my 2 cents, in the form of several paragraphs.\n\nFirst off, I need to talk about Unity.  If I wait, it might be missed, as this is going to be a wall o' text post.  I've worked in Unity.  I've taken college classes in Unity.  I've given Unity *MORE* than a fair chance to show me what it can do.  And my official, semi-expert conclusion is that it can do a hell of a lot, but something like this is well beyond what would work feasibly.  First off, there's the issue with licensing and royalty fees.  I'm not sure how or what or if you plan to monetize this thing (God, I hope not, because that would be an awful mess), but whether you do or not, Unity's going to want money for both licenses for every person who contributes to this, as well as for every person who plays it.  I've dealt with Unity's corporate before, and they're not the sorts who are kind about this type of thing.\n\nSecond, I'd like to offer my services in whatever way my time will allow.  As far as applicable skills go, I'm mostly a utilities/core/etc. library programmer these days, sharing my workload on game engine development with my friend/understudy.  As such, he takes care of the stuff that the end user sees and interacts with, such as the UI, entities, etc. (but not the render engine), and I take care of the things that, if I do my job right, the player never notices, like user input (mouse, keyboard, gamepad, joystick, etc.), audio interfacing, and graphics rendering.\n\nMostly, with the exception of the graphics work, I code in C#, putting everything in a nice, handy, currently-XNA-but-soon-to-be-Mono library that, as soon as I get it moved to Mono, will be open-source'd under one of the commercial-friendly attribution licenses.\n\nFor the graphics stuff, I've recently gotten into working with OpenGL, seeing as how XNA's render system leaves much to be desired.  The going is slow, but at least it's easier to understand than half the wrapper libraries out there these days.\n\nThe two interface through the handy InteropServices library that Microsoft has in .NET, which allows me to write a neat and orderly wrapper library in C++ that allows me to call the managed .NET DLL from unmanaged C++.  And as I understand it, Mono has a similar thing, either in the works or already released, which means the code should, once I get it all finessed (with the largest hammer I can find) into being Mono-compatible.  If this works as I expect it to, it would allow the core of the engine to be developed in robust, easily-compatible C++, while allowing .NET/Mono libraries to handle the things that C++ doesn't do so well (any place we can replace pointers with managed code is a bonus, in my mind).\n\nI'm also a writer, doing mostly lighter (less science-heavy), character-driven science fiction, and an audio engineer with a focus on sound effects.  While I do compose music, it's almost exclusively for the piano, and YMMV on whether or not you consider it 'good'.  ","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"&gt;Last word of what?\n&gt;Where does it start looking for this signature?\n\nSince we only have the disk devices to boot from right now, it means the last word of the first sector must be 0x10AD. When the bootloader is loaded into memory from the M35FD, it means that memory address 0x0000-0x01FE is bootloader code, and 0x01FF equals 0x10AD.\n\nI say \"last word of the sector\" because we might have alternate disk devices (such as a hard drive), and they might not have 512 word-sized sectors. If that's the case, I don't want to require people to have to jump over the signature if they have a larger bootloader.\n\n&gt; Does this imply that it loops the entire first sector of each device until it finds this signature?\n\nNo, it means right now that it loads the first sector of each floppy drive attached, and checks if the word at 0x01FF equals 0x10AD.\n\n&gt; Isn't that a little wasteful?\n\nThe minimum length you can retrieve from a floppy is one sector. So that's one sector from each possible device (with a disk inserted) right now. Plus, I assume there is no seek time since I assume the disk devices start at the first sector.\n\n&gt; Why not start with that word, and then start execution from 0x0001?\n\nBecause we can't read a partial sector, we'll have to read the entire first sector into memory. So, hypothetically, the signature could be anywhere in that first sector.\n\nI placed it at the end because it's possible that even if some form of secondary bootloader/program is put directly after the bootloader in memory, there may be some form of header or something at the beginning that would need to be jumped over.\n\nSince you might need to jump at the end of the bootsector, you could also jump over the boot signature.

You said it well, \"The idea of programming your own logic into a battle-device used against others in a multiplayer game\".  I'm sure 0x10c has a long list of games inspiring it.

{"body":"DISCLAIMER: This is partially copy-pasted from my comment 10 minutes ago, before I knew about this post. I figured it would be more useful here.\n\nEDIT: Edited to reflect spec change in HCM from 16-bits to 12-bits\n\nTo answer your question, my system could not display 384 different characters on the screen at once, and neither can yours (Colour mode, HCM can)(though it can display more). This is, however, generally not encountered, especially if programs are designed to avoid it. It is physical problem with the hardware, which though neither of us actually solve, both mitigate, in different ways.(without changing the hardware, as you have done)\n\n\n**Assumption: remapping font alters existing characters. **\n\nBoth my system (remapping font buffer) and colour mode cannot display each cell on the screen as different characters. HCM can, but I'm not talking about that.\n\nNow a more detailed description of both systems, as I understand them, and their advantages and drawbacks.\n\n**My System** (remapping font buffer)\n\n* Works by: When a character needs to be displayed on the screen which is not currently in the font loaded onto the screen's font, it remaps a new font to the screen, which contains the new character. The DCPU keeps track of what characters are currently loaded, and in what index, in the screen's internal font.\n\n* Advantages: **No modifications to spec necessary**  \nCan be used to display an arbitrarily large character set, with many uncommonly used symbols, but see limitations.  \nCan be abstracted into the OS/driver.\n  \nRequires *no change* to the existing hardware/specifications; done all in software. \n\n* Limitations: Assuming limitations of screen set forth earlier, it cannot display more than 128 different characters at once. This is fine for most scripts in most non-edge cases. Even if a character set contains more than 128 characters *total*, generally less than all 128 of them will be in use at the same time, because some will likely be used more than once (like space, the latin 'e', '.' or whatever). \n\nDepending on how long the screen hardware ends up taking to do a font remap, it could drag performance slightly in some circumstances. It is quite optimizeable, however, eg. by kicking out the least used character out of the font, or combining font remaps together when more than one character needs to be changed (eg by waiting a second before remapping the font, to see if more changes need to be made at the same time--more useful if it is the computer writing to the screen) \n\n* Summary: Allows an arbitrarily large number of different characters to be displayed by the screen, just not all at once. The heavy work can be abstracted away into OS/Driver calls and stuff.\n\n\n**Your System** (Colour mode) (expanded native screen character size to 8 bits)\n\n* Works by: Changing hardware spec so that, by whatever means (including HWI to change modes), the screen can accept longer characters (8-bits). \n\nThis would allow a static font twice as big as currently, and (if using a static font system) twice as many accessible characters, and (if using a dynamic font system) would allow twice as many different characters to be displayed on the screen at a single time.\n\n* Advantages: Doubles the number of different characters which can be displayed on the screen at one time. If using in conjunction with my system (dynamic font remapping) allows greater number of different characters on screen, and more infrequent remapping. \n\nIf programmer is working with raw direct hardware assembly, *without an OS*, then it might need less code, or be slightly easier to program. With an OS handling interactions with the screen, however, you could simply tell the screen driver or whatever to print character 372 at 4, 7, and it would deal with the remapping of the *actual* font as necessary by itself. \n\n* Limitations: **Modifies original spec.** Does not allow for more than 256 different characers, period. Also removes blink capability. modified hardware likely not available (Notch likes simplicity)\n\n* Summary: With modification of accepted hardware spec, allows more characters to be displayed by the screen. By itself it is useful, and in conjunction with dynamically remapping the font, makes a very nice solution.\n\n\n**Combined System** (dynamic font remapping, with 8-bit characters)\n\n* Works by: Same as my system, except with Gareth's 8-bit characters\n\n* Advantages: All those present in my system, *plus* decreased need for remapping (characters are more likely to be present in the screen-font, as it is larger), and therefore increased performance. Limitation on maximum number of different characters possible to display on the screen at once higher.\n\n* Limitations: can still only display 256 different characters on the screen at once, **Modifies Spec**, removes blink.\n\n* Summary: Clearly the best of both worlds, if available hardware can support it. (likely not)\n\n\n**Your New System (HCM Mode-16-bit)** (uses all bits for characters)\n\n* Works by: changing hardware spec to allow 16-bit characters. *Interesting* included hardware limitations.\n\n* Advantages: Huge number of possible characters. Possibilities for easily accessible multiple scripts and fonts without remaps. monochrome. \n\n* Limitations: Changes hardware spec, which I don't. potentially crippling arbitrary limitations. monochrome. Without more intelligent font remapping procedure, excess RAM is used.\n\n* Summary: would be great, and solve all the problems, but would be monochrome, **and would require changing the hardware specs**\n\n\n**Your New (revised) System (HCM MODE-12-bit)** (uses lower 12 bits for character)\n\n* Works by: changing hardware spec to allow 12-bit characters.\n\n* Advantages: 12 bits allows for enough characters for a static font, even with large script sets, redundant fonts per script (bold, italic etc.), etc.. Partially chromatic.\n\n* Limitations: Changes hardware spec. Same potentially crippling arbitrary limitations.\n\n* Summary: The best* static font *solution for displaying large character sets .\n\n\nClearly, the optimal solution is an OS/driver handled font remapping system, with or without 8-bit screen-characters. Clearly, in some circumstances, a 8-bit font would be necessary (eg. displaying 200 different characters on the screen at once), and in some (eg. displaying 300 different characters on the screen at once) would even be insufficient. With the dynamic font system, fonts can have arbitrarily long character sets, even without 8-bit characters, and with, things are easier for the OS/driver.\n\nIn a 16-bit font mode, many of these problems would be solved, but new ones would arise (want japanese characters to have rainbow scrolling through)  \nIt's good as an orthogonal system, if notch makes a screen that works with it, but there is still a place for dynamic font remapping. Ditto for 12-bit.\n\nWorking with 8-bit characters on the screen as opposed to 7-bit ones would be great, and make many things better.  I would love a screen with the capabilities you mentioned. We don't have that, though, and my solution provides an interesting workaround, more capable than simply allowing more screen-native characters. If you wanted more than 256 characters anyway,  you would still need something like what I proposed. If it can be abstracted away from even the assembly programmer, much more interesting things can be done. And finally, it provides the only solution to the problem of being able to type any one of thousands of different characters. even with the current screen, as long as most of the characters are somewhat common. The **screen** doesn't need to support 50 000 different characters, just the OS/driver needs to know how to remap them into the font of the screen as needed.\n\nAnd as TOFU-7 showed, it is possible to have a *static* **7-bit** font for Japanese *and* Latin.\n\nThe challenge is writing software to deal with limitations in the hardware, which must be taken as immutable. Finally, a challenge.\n\n\n\nI would love to have screen hardware capable of supporting 8- 12- or 16-bit characters (your idea). Even without that, it would be possible to achieve an illusion of an arbitrarily large font by remapping it as necessary.  \n\nI like your system very much, my *only* problem is that it modifies the hardware spec, which by this point has reached a semi-divine status.\n\nBoth systems are useful in their own right, and combined become even more powerful. HCM mode is also useful, but independent of colour/blink mode + dynamic font remapping. ","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

I suspect this weighs on his mind and is partly the reason he responded so badly to all the 0x10c hype... if you put yourself in his shoes there is a lot of pressure to 'prove himself'.\n\nPersonally, if Notch doesn't want Mojang to go down the route of finishing 0x10c I think they should sell the concept to another development studio as it has incredible potential, both to be a good game and to make a lot of money for someone - even if simply by being associated with Notch.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"Static typing has _a lot_ to do with performance. With dynamic typing you always have to do type-checking when working with variables, in a statically typed language you don't.  \nJavaScript will also consume more RAM than a Java application again because of JavaScript's dynamic typing and lack of classes. In Java, a definition of a class pretty much strictly defines how an object works. You can't make run-time changes to a class, making Java much more memory-efficient than JavaScript. Java also utilizes primitives (int, long, byte, float, double) and allocates them properly, unlike JavaScript which will always have to use wrappers for any variable no matter what it contains. An integer in Java takes four bytes of memory until it needs to be wrapped (for instance if you call .toString()).  \nThese things and many more allows static typing to be generally superior to dynamic typing - especially JavaScript's. Dynamic typing is good for two things; communication between languages and frameworks, and sending parameters to methods (instead of method overloading and specific classes for \"temporary\" use)  \nJava will outperform JavaScript on any type of benchmark, and it's not because Java is super-duper-genius, but because dynamic typing has a lot of pitfalls and drawbacks and very few - if any - benefits.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"&gt; NOP usually is equivalent to 0x0,\n\nNot necessarily right.\n\n* For x86-32, `00 00` is `ADD [EAX], AL` (Intel syntax). Quite far from a no-op.\n* For some architectures, all-zero are invalid instructions (Itanium, PowerPC, S/390, SPARC, Super-H)\n* For some architectures, all-zero are halt instructions (65xx, Alpha, PDP-11, VAX).\n\n&gt; NOP means that does nothing. [...] Using SET A, A as NOP or something similar, makes that the server waste computing power and time doing RAM access for nothing,\n\nWrong. Few architectures have a dedicated spot in their instruction table for NOP. Many architectures don't have a dedicated instruction for 'true NOP'. Instead, the decoder figures out that the instruction can be optimized out.\n\n-edit- Even for x86, it used to be the case that the canonical NOP (`90`) was an alias for `xchg eax, eax`, and the decoder would figure out that this is a no-op. That's no longer entirely true, because in 64-bits mode, that is not a no-op: it would set the top 32 bits of `rax` to zero. The true no-op would be `xchg rax, rax`, which is (or can be) encoded as `48 90`.\n\nSo in the case of x86-64, `90` is no longer a NOP-due-to-optimization, but an actual, dedicated NOP.\n\n---\n\nI suggest you [look up the facts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP#Machine_instruction) next time before making statements like these.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"Aye, it would take one man with a singular vision and absolute dedication to it. And I think Notch would be the first to admit that just isn't his personality. He likes to pick things up, play with them, make something cool out of it and move on. Hence why I think Mojang will stick to making easy-to-do low cost games (like Scrolls). Minecraft is probably the exception, not the rule.\n\nAs I see it, the main issue with 0x10c is that the concept best suits an MMO style game (even if it isn't an MMO as we currently know them). Given the likely popularity and press 0x10c will get, thanks to minecraft, sales will be off the chart from day 1. That means having a huge server infrastructure in place to handle it - not to mention game content thats fun. Minecraft was lucky because the sandbox 'lego' aspects of the game made it replayable, and they also didn't have to deal with the 'sim-city' effect of having millions of sales go live on day 1. Not to mention that Mojang have no experience in MMO development. They would probably also need to hire specialists to develop the backend server support for the DCPU.\n\nBottom line, 0x10c is so ambitious it just aint a hobby project. I think everyone (fans and developers) is coming to realise that.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

I hope he works it out, because it would be a shame if he just sits in that office fucking around with the 3D printer and the occasional .party() out of fear he might dissapoint someone off the internet with a failed product.  \n  \nI just get sick of seeing stuff like this.  \n  \nFor what it's worth, I think he wanted to treat this game the same way Minecraft started: build the bones of the gameplay concepts, feel out what was good and what was bad, then start hiring coders / artists / producers if it was worth turning it into a full game.

And as for control consoles, base blocks (like 45 degree workstation console base) can simply be placed in the ship, then you can place a monitor module panel, or a button and/or lever console panel into it. Each control panel module might act as one hardware device, connected to the central DCPU-16.

So you can have alarms going off across the ship for a rapid depressurization, attack, incoming ships, etc, so the music playback would just have play/stop/fast forward/rewind/skipto controlled by the computer and the midi sequence itself is just transferred to the buffer.  I wouldn't think its necessary to have the DCPU-16 try to emulate the playback, just handle the control.  I think players should be able to upload a MIDI file to the 'ship', which would just be the same server the DCPU-16 software is being stored.  Maybe have a local folder where players can drop MIDI files into and it gets synced to the server, as long as it doesn't exceed X MBs?  If the player chooses to they can allow the MIDI file to be transferred/shared to other players? lol it would be absolutely hilarious to hail another ship with a message while having your MIDI selection playing.... or have your system hacked just to have Rick Astley constantly playing.\n\nThere's a huge archive of MIDI sequences online ... stuff like this would see a huge revival:\n\nhttp://www.olgris.kiev.ua/des/midi%20lat.html\n\n\nEdit: added some stuff, nothing removed.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"While it is nice to think of Notch as a sugar daddy (and he is backing a whole bunch of video game projects of many different kinds... just look at Cobalt and its history) it would be wise of Notch to not simply toss money around for a game like 0x10^c.  Since his intention is to make an MMO after a fashion, it really does represent a significant and ongoing financial commitment and dedicating a significant fraction of his development team to such a product.\n\nI also have no idea what kind of shareholder status there may be in Mojang as well.  Notch does seem to be the primary shareholder, although his recent divorce/breakup with EZ may throw a bit of a monkey wrench into that.  Mojang doesn't appear to be a partnership, but the option is certainly there to have other people involved with the business in some way if necessary.  I have seen companies like TSR (of Dungeons &amp; Dragons) where the ownership of the company was wrestled away from the original founders in a brutal way and the company driven into the ground with inept choices but most fans not really aware of what was going on internally until it got too late.\n\nFor myself, I can't imagine what it is like to be Notch in terms of having so much money I could do literally anything I wanted, but having so much fame that a brain fart like 0x10^c results in a huge fan community that takes on a life of its own.  I'm not denying that Notch also spent a couple of months doing some actual coding and trying ideas, but I haven't seen anything really dedicated on the topic and in fact there has been a whole lot of distractions to pull Notch away that wasn't the case when he started Minecraft originally.\n\nWhat it looks like to me is that Notch is interested in finding some other developer to more or less take over 0x10^c, as it is a good idea but in his current position and state of life it is much harder to get it going.  You might see somebody like Dinnerbone taking over as a lead developer (which would be tough on the Minecraft community) or Notch could get somebody else as well.  That takes some time.  I suggest another developer because it is something Notch has mentioned he is interested in doing as well, but finding that person does take time and doesn't need to be found immediately.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"**There are only 3 valid reasons why people don't use java for most games:**  \n1. Too many assets in other languages (C/C++ usually).  Companies or teams have invested a lot of time and money into developing engines or toolsets/toolchains etc in other languages and don't want to spend the time or money to rebuild them.  \n2.  You loose control of exactly when objects are destroyed, which can cause threads to hang at a critical moment.  That being said this is kind of a bullshit argument because it is based on the garbage collectors of 10 years ago which used simple mark and sweep style garbage collection.  Newer incremental gc systems are much more intelligent and never pause typical applications for more than ~1ms at a time.  \n3.  Last but not least: lack jvm support on consoles (yea i know they ruin everything)  \n\n**As for why Java *can* be more efficient than c++:**   \n1.  Managed heap alloc/access is typically much faster than unmanaged heap.  \n2.  In a native language like c/c++ people are always talking about the performance benefits of managing their own memory, but reference counting is *very* expensive and there is no need to do that in Java (and a good GC system is better at it than you or I will ever be).  \n3.  Object destruction *can* be much faster, since there is no destructor that must be called, as is the case in c++.  The memory block can just be GC'd. \n\nSo there you have it.  Java can be faster than a natively compiled language like c++, but c++ has an install base advantage and works on consoles.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"So here's what I've been thinking: \n\n1.  the first big issue is DCPU.  It's really cool, but also intimidating.  We don't want to keep out people who don't understand programming, but we also don't want to exclude the coders by dumbing the computer down.  So what my thought is, is that every ship would come with a built-in OS.  It doesn't run the ship as well as it could, but it's enough to do what you need.  This way, coders can wipe the computer and rebuild the system the way they want, while noncoders can just ignore it and get to the other things they want to do.\n\n2.  And speaking of other things, the second big issue is what else there should be to do.  I think that a procedurally generated galaxy is a good starting point, because exploration is going to probably be the first thing that comes to peoples' minds.  The basic Idea would be that upon generating your game, your home system is generated along with a layout of where other systems are located.  The contents of those systems are then generated when you travel to them.\n\n3. I think you should be able to build structures other than spaceships.  Like mining stations or the like for resource gathering.  I'm not totally married to the idea of gathering resources, because that might feel a bit too \"minecrafty,\" but it might be very fun if done properly.  You could also build factories for creating new spaceships.\n\n4. I like the idea of accessible combat mechanics.  Not so much worrying about manually adjusting the output of your engines and more just moving around and shooting.  I think it would be great to have 0^2 levels kept track of, so you could aim to just punch holes in the ship to kill the people inside.  Also, it would be super fun to be able to leave your ship as a boarding party.\n\nEDIT: 5.  Ooh!  I can't believe I almost forgot.  It's an old trope but a good one: advanced precursor race.  None of the whole \"coming back to save/destroy the galaxy\" crap, just rare, randomly placed ruins around the galaxy with powerful or unique equipment, or even just a good place to set up shop and use as a base.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"Unless you can demonstrate that Jeremy is actually copying portions of 0x10^c in his software, your arguments that he is legally messing around with Notch's game is unfounded.  He doesn't really need to even have Notch's permission on even starting this project, and that is where you are simply wrong.\n\nWould it be nice to get Notch's blessing on this concept?  I suppose that isn't a terrible thing, but even if Notch said \"I don't like people doing this\", it still isn't necessarily even unethical to start another game similar to 0x10^c that uses a CPU specification of some sort as a key component to the game.  That Notch hasn't really done much with the idea over the past several months almost screams that somebody else ought to pick up the ball and make a go with this idea since Notch has even sort of abandoned the idea (further demonstrating that even Notch's blessing is sort of not necessary).\n\nI'd agree that the similarity to the name Notch used is perhaps over the top.  Frankly, this project is so early in its development that complaining about the name is sort of silly and can be easily fixed if that really appears to be a problem.  There have also been several discussions on how to tweak the DCPU instruction set that it may be possible to even improve upon the DCPU, give it a new name, and make it much better than Notch's original specification.\n\nWhat I see you doing here is complaining about even the idea that somebody other than Notch is making a space-based game with a CPU emulator at its core.  Other video games have been discussed on this sub-reddit including games that very similar to 0x10^c but are in other stages of development.  I don't think raising the fact that Jeremy has put some effort into making a similar game is necessarily bad, and I really don't understand your concern here... other than some sort of unwritten hacker ethos and that you wouldn't be making a game like this.  Your concerns are noted.\n\nIt does look like you think Notch has patented this idea though, and are complaining that Jeremy has violated that patent.  I see this in modding forums of various kinds (particularly with Minecraft) where people bitch about somebody copying the ideas of another mod and all sorts of informal \"hacker\" intellectual property standards that has no basis at all with actual law.  \n\nCopyright covers a particular expression of an idea, not the idea itself.  The only permission that is really needed is if Jeremy is using the actual expression of the space-based game with a CPU emulator core that Notch used in his demos, something I don't see is being used.  Perhaps it would be useful to show some more creativity and do something else as the breadth of human experience ought to give you room to come up with a completely different idea for a game, but that doesn't mean it is terrible to copy something that is a good idea in the first place and trying another slightly different approach.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

This subreddit has always been very pro-DCPU as most of the members have come here from some programming background, but I don't think 0x10c was going to be like that. It probably would have been slightly more like the minecraft redstone model (although maybe more of a compulsory element). \n\nMy guess is the ship would of had some kind of default DCPU operating system provided in game (at a fairly high standard)... then the potential would have been there to open up parts of that (or perhaps even the whole thing) to recode it.\n\nThat said, what is the point of having a programmable CPU if programming that CPU doesn't lead to some kind of in-game fun. \n\n**Tl;dr:** Notch always spoke about it as a game **with** a programmable CPU, not a game **about** programming a CPU.

You could glean ideas Notch used in its design for another CPU architecture design... and arguably even improve upon Notch's ideas or at least do something at least different and original.\n\nI do know that copyright laws are much stronger in the UK than they are in the USA, so there may be some cultural and legal gulf going on here.  \"Intellectual Property\" laws are similar mixed up so much that for me it is often difficult to understand where one ends and another begins if you get into some of the borderline issues... and where they've been used by corporations to protect their intellectual ideas and products.  Furthermore, courts (especially in common law countries like the UK and USA) seem to be increasingly giving the benefit of the doubt to those companies and content creators thus dismissing 3rd party usage of ideas as infringing.\n\nThe unfortunate thing about these laws is that ultimately it depends on whomever you get as a judge if a dispute comes up to arbitrarily decide whatever the law really means in a particular situation... and those laws are not very clear even to trained lawyers who have spent a lifetime studying these things.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

On larger scales, [Astronomical Units (AU:s)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit) are often used, with 1 AU being the mean distance between the earth and the sun (about 149.60e9 m).\n\nGiven that we probably don't want to deal with floating point numbers, the base unit to be used is probably going to be 10^k meters for some integer k. Perhaps two systems, one for sub-meter accuracy (for use on board the ship for example) and one for huge distances.\n\nRight now what you should do is obviously just use a placeholder length unit. eg. don't think about it, just use dimensionless units everywhere.\n\n&gt;and when you hit the edge of the grid you wrap around to the other side.\n\nThat's a sphere, so not 2d.

Just let the transmission die after a certain time (which makes sense, as the transmission power decreases with the area of the bounding sphere of the transmission, iee r^-2 , so if you increase the distance 16-fold the power is decreased 256-fold for example).\n\n&gt;Example: Player A is x away from Player C, and Player B is 2x away from Player C. Player A is constantly transmitting '1', and Player B is constantly transmitting '0'. Player C will receive '110110110110'\n\nHow would this work? It doesn't matter if player B is 1000x away from player C, both B and A sends data at the same rate. If B is at distance 2 ticks from C and A is at distance 1 tick from C and the speed of transmission is 1 length unit/tick, then player C should receive \";A;AB;AB;AB;AB\" and so on: nothing at tick 0, an A at tick 1, then both A and B at tick 2,3,4...\n\nI'm not sure exactly what you want to do, but I think that what you want is to have a list of \"transmission\" points, which can be visualized as circles with radius c\\*(t-D) (where c is the transmission speed, t is the time from the start of the transmission and D is the initial delay: the circle is only defined for t &gt;= D). Every tick, for each ship you see if the distance from the ship to the transmission point is about c*(t-D), and if that's the case, you receive the message. If you want to send on the message, you create a new transmission point at that ship's position and add it to the list of transmission points. At the end of each tick, you remove all transmission points that's too old (say 100 ticks or something, just to avoid having to calculate a gazillion transmission points). Could be a great exercise in Object-Oriented Programming if you don't know that yet ;)\n\nEDIT: I was bored, so I implemented just that: http://codepad.org/eBCYRcPR\n\nShip A is at 0,0 and sends out a message. Ship B is closest and intercepts is first, then ship C intercepts it. The signal wouldn't normally reach ship E which is 16 units away from ship A and the maximum distance the signal travels is 8, but we have put a repeater ship D right between ship A and ship E, which will repeat the message so that E can reach it (A, B and C will also be able to read the message again on the return trip).\n\nIt's trivial to add control code for the ships to for example disregard messages sent by themselves, add ship movement (perhaps with the ships movement being controlled by the received radio messages), have different powered transmissions on different ships, require power consumption to send a message (perhaps you can have a base ship with infinite energy, then a \"tanker\" ship that can fly around and recharge other ships at their request)... and so on.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"Here's my two pence worth... Firstly, I'm a developer with 30 years experience, the last 10 in .NET (C#).  I am an MCT, MCPD, MCP &amp; MCTS and as well as developing I've built and run a development house of 85+ staff and run an IT training centre. I have coded in numerous other languages including Java, JS, C, C++, and TypeScript but mostly stick to C# these days.\n\nI have evaluated Unity over the last year and find it inefficient for voxel based engines - though there are solutions out there.  It will give you the a wide recruitment base but is very much more suited to non-destructive environs.\n\nEven though I'm not an OpenGL expert (I focus on high performance server code these days), I would suggest this would be a better route to recruiting Open Source talent.  Like already, mentioned the engine and graphics are only one part of development, and you only need a couple of skilled Devs for the role.\n\nUltimately, letting people who volunteer decide is entirely the right instinct.\n\nAs you're using a collaboration of developers I personally would look at hosting a Mono (.NET) solution on GitHub with elements of the engine potentially in C++, but server code and engine in C#.  This would give the best combination of performance and robustness as the C# compiler will enforce an element of static checking and validation at compile time.  With so many developers, you really want to focus on having secrete class libraries of functionality surrounded with automated unit tests, and a TDD approach will maximise your chance of success when working with a geographically dispersed group.\n\nI'd love to get involved if I wasn't up to my neck in code commitments already, but I'll be watching with interest. I might point some devs in your direction too.\n\nGood luck!!","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"Well, the software I'm writing uses a linear scale right now.\n\n    Player 1 is at (X=4, Y=9)\n    Player 2 is at (X=3, Y=1)\n\nWith the coordinates, you create a right triangle on the grid and use the Pythagorean theorem (a^2 + b^2 = c^2) to find the distance between them. \n\nThe delay constant (D) is currently 50ms.  I don't know enough about physics and big distances to calculate what it would really be in space, but I don't use real units (miles/whatever) anyways.\n\nSo:\n    1^2 + 8^2 = x^2\n\n    1 + 64 = x^2\n\n    65 = x^2\n\n    8.062 = x\n\nThus,\n    D * 8.062 = x\n\n    50 * 8.062 = x\n\n    403.1 = x\n\nThe transmission will be delayed by 403.1ms.  Internally, this is rounded up to 410ms.  In the server is a 10ms tick that processes bytes in the send queue.  This math is repeated for each receiving party.\n\nI scrapped the idea of random/garbled interference and the idea of multiple senders mixing together inside the byte.  It's too much work.\n\nExample: Player A is x away from Player C, and Player B is 2x away from Player C.  Player A is constantly transmitting '1', and Player B is constantly transmitting '0'.  Player C will receive '110110110110'\n\nThe size of the transmittable grid increases for each player joining, so the wall where transmissions stop is dynamic.    Currently each player has a trajectory and a velocity, and when you hit the edge of the grid you wrap around to the other side.\n\n\n\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

So many people now have so many different things they *want* to include, that it would spiral out of all control - and as with all community projects it would lack a single person in charge to artistically direct it. \n\nEssentially we'd be in the same position Notch is - trying to actually boil down a vast game concept into something concentrated, achievable and fun. Only no single person would have overall creative control making those tough decisions even harder than they are for Notch. \n\nNot to mention, the DCPU concept seems to tie in best with the MMO style game... a community driven MMO would be almost impossible, due to the HUGE costs associated with setting up a backend server archietecture that could handle the DCPU emulation and game world.\n\nThen there is the problem that if the game ever did come to something (against the odds), we'd be up against potential legal/copyright issues.\n\nAs much as I'd like to see the game made (whoever makes it) I'm not sure community driven is the answer yet... as we'd be making a game without even knowing precisely what we are actually making.\n\nMy view is continue to gently pressure Mojang to complete 0x10c - they have the money, I just can't understand why they aren't ploughing their massive piles of cash into developing this.

{"body":"I have to say, I think that it is clear that this game is _related_ and _inspired_ by 0x10c, sort of like Terraria and Minecraft is, beyond some basic mechanics, Terraria is very different from Minecraft. I don't think it's _possible_ to rip off 0x10c this early in its development, as we don't know that much about its gameplay yet. This project, if it is continued, would have to invent many of its mechanics. Looking at the current pace of development on 0x10c, I think it would likely that this game would reach a playable stage much earlier. By the time 0x10c came out, the game would be well enough developed that it would be a game as its own. As for having a programmable computer on board, Rodina is doing the same thing, so I think there is room for more games with them. As for the computer being a DCPU, I think this is _kind_ _of_ shaky ground, but in the end, I think it's _morally_ okay, as long as you credit Notch for the spec, but from a legal perspective, I think you should ask him. The name, however, I think has to change. I don't think the name \"0x184\" can be defended in any way. The name \"0x10c\" has reasoning behind it, whereas it seems this name is in hexadecimal for the sake of being in hexadecimal (and being similar to 0x10c).

The idea would be to give developers time to create programmes for the DCPU and to get the spaceship part of the game hammered out.\n\nApparently Notch has also said they won't be sticking to the usual alpha/beta development cycle... now I understood that to mean the game would be in perma-development (a bit like minecraft was only without the arbitrary alpha/beta naming).\n\nSo when can we play it? - hard to say. On the one hand, I don't think they are that far off having the spaceship part of the game worked out. My guess would be sometime before Christmas 2013 there will be some form of release (but thats just a wild guess). However don't expect the initial release to be anything spectacular, and I think Notch himself is very concerned about over-hyping 0x10c in its early stages - so they may hold off on a release for some time.\n\nWe also have to remember that 0x10c is only being worked on by two people, and when you have such a small team its very easy to get distracted by other things and spend weeks at a time not actually working on the game.\n\n\n*'Release' could mean one of several things though - it could be a limited release to several people making DCPU programmes or it could be a full public release with a subscription model/purchase model from the go like minecraft did.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"I think that a ship part should consist of a set amount of power that goes into it (processing power I dont think that thus far we have a limit on electrical power), then the construction should dictate how well it responds to different stimuli. \n\nSo first you make an automated turret to shoot enemies/debris, and its tier 3. This means you have 3,000 cycles processor power to spend on the different parts. \n\nNext you decide what housing you want light medium or heavy. This dictates the scale of how much each aspect of the turret costs.So if you have a heavy case it takes more power to do everything but it takes hits better.\nFor example:\n\n\ntier 3 automated turret has a heavy case and you want it to be a big DERP gun. \n[Speed 250] (time to acquire a lock)\n\n[Accuracy 250] (likelihood it will hit when it fires)\n\n[Reload 250] (time for recharge)\n\n[Damage 2250] (its damage what else did you expect?)\n\nSo you have to fly the ship to aim most of the way to get a lock and it slowly acquires a lock to fire and reloads slowly, BUT if it does hit then it will do massive damage, a gun to take on something like a capitol ship. And if it gets hit it will probably survive the blast only taking 20 or so damage out of one of the different attributes with a % chance to come from where the power is distributed... so most likely it comes from damage. \n\nALTERNATIVELY\n\ntier 3 light automatic turret  light case 3000 power still\n\n[Speed 750] \n\n[Accuracy 1000]\n\n[Reload 1000]\n\n[Damage 250]\n\nwill lock and fire quickly many times in a short span of time less like a howitzer more like a machine gun, but still tier 3. \n\nWhat determines tiers? material costs, what materials are needed. So tier 1 2 &amp;3 may all require all the same stuff just more of it, then tier 4 takes some higher quality metal or more complex circuitry either of which are rarer. 4 &amp; 5 much the same story then tier 6 7 &amp; 8 all take a higher level of materials again, again with increased scarcity of materials to find or make. and finally tiers 9 &amp; 10 take a colossal effort to make and would probably be reserved for stations or  flag ships of whole fleets (what else could fill their processor power needs?) \n\nthinking a standard exponential curve for the processor power needs from tier to tier.\n\ntier 1 [500]\ntier 2 [1000]\ntier 3 [3000]\ntier 4 [12000]\ntier 5 [60,000]\ntier 6 [360.000]\ntier 7 [2,520,000]\ntier 8 [20,160,000]\ntier 9 [181,440,000]\ntier 10 [1,814,400,000]\n{would appreciate a more reasonable scale if anyone is in fact skilled with mathematics and exponents- here a FTFY would really be appreciated}\n\nFull customization with subtlety and simplicity that can then have layers of complexity slowly introduced and will work with engines shields mining equipment ect.

{"body":"A few observations about keeping fans updated that I've picked up from minecraft;\n\n* Users get irrationally annoyed when devs talk about including things which for whatever reason don't materialise. For this reason \"hype-management\" is a big deal.\n* Users don't actually expect to see as much progress as developers often want to give them. For example, I don't think any of us would be bothered if updates were at a snails pace. Even the smallest news usually sends peoples imagination flying.\n* Unpredictable news schedules cause fans anxiety... because it means they feel compelled to check regularly (hey, its human nature to want to know more if you're passionate about something). But when news is sparse (like now) fans are often left dissapointed. One of the best things about minecraft are the regular friday news updates, *I think this is where 0x10c would benefit.* Maybe even say that the last day of every month there will be a blog, tweet, screenshot, Reddit or something related to 0x10c - however small. That way, we wouldn't need to check pedantically and it would stop a lot of the \"OMG, has he given up on 0x10c!\" Anxiety.\n* A great example of the above is Dean Halls' DayZ. He got a lot of flak from the community for the lack of updates, and since he comitted to weekly/every other weekly updates people have really chilled out - they can see progress is being made, they know when news will be released and it keeps them excited. \n\nAnyway, I can understand the OPs comment (even though I wouldn't have said it myself).

The size of the byte has historically been hardware dependent and no definitive standards existed that mandated the size. The de facto standard of eight bits is a convenient power of two permitting the values 0 through 255 for one byte. The international standard IEC 80000-13 codified this common meaning. Many types of applications use information representable in eight or fewer bits and processor designers optimize for this common usage. The popularity of major commercial computing architectures has aided in the ubiquitous acceptance of the 8-bit size.[3]\n\nThe smallest addressable unit of memory in the DCPU-16 are 16 bit values (words in real world), so you are right and wrong at same time. **In the DCPU-16 a word = byte = 16 bit value.**","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"Java use stack space for scope variables, call stack pointers and primitives, which basically are the same things you store in the stack in any C/C++ program as well..  \nIn some cases Java can be faster in C++ because its dynamic compilation nature allows it to optimize across libraries; example :\n\n    int getSomething()\n    {\n        return someOtherLibrary_getSomething();\n    }\n\nin external library (someOtherLibrary.lib)\n\n    int a = 5;\n    int someOtherLibrary_getSomething()\n    {\n       return a;\n    }\n\nIn Java's case, it would be possible to simply return the value of a in getSomething(), but due to the nature of C/C++'s static compilation, it is unaware of the code in the external library, and therefore unable to perform any useful optimizations on it, and therefore will have to go through the entire call stack every time.  \nJava programs can also take advantages of any platform specific implementations without having to be specifically compiled for it, like new SIMD extensions - C++ can not.  \nI don't think performance is the reason why C++ is the default, although native integration (\"Get down to the metal\") might be a reason, as it might hinder new games in being \"next-gen\" because they might have to rely on specific Java implementation for new features. With Java programs you will also always be able to retrieve the original Java source (though obfuscated), which gives room for people tampering with the software.  \nBut most of all I think C++ is the default for game development simply because it has been the defacto standard for two decades.

{"body":"More power to you all - but this is cat-herding at it's finest. You're a light-year away from basic goals, yet people are already arguing about implementation. Holy wars, here we come. \n\nStep 1 is to make sure Notch is even ok with this - not base the effort on something he said while in a cranky mood. Give the man a break. And no - you can't work on something *like* 0x10c - people want to work on 0x10c, blessed by Notch, not some spinoff.\n\nStep 2 is to get a deeper understanding of what the game's functional specs are. I think we all have the same basic idea - MMORPG, first person shooter, with old-school 8 bit computers you can really program. But - there's a world of other info to flesh out. You need to get that done *first*, or architectural choices like language and if it's client-server or peer-to-peer or whatever don't have any meaning. \n\nNow - to ignore a portion of what I've just written - I do recall that Notch was talking about simulating the 0x10c computers on the server side, massively, in java. I'd take it further - that spec is simple enough that you could support a *STUNNING* number of instances without all that much modern horsepower, in any of a number of languages. So - nobody should assume that since this would be a community project, a client-server model is off of the table. There's plenty of free hosting services that could handle the hit and not even notice (I'm thinking RedHat's OpenShift - and there are many, many others). Had to get that off my chest. \n\nSo - someone in a position to do it, see if we can get Notch's blessings, for real. Without that first step, this is doomed to fail.

I admit I'm a pretty frustrated along with the rest of us that he promoted it with t-shirts and everything than just gave up on it, but \"indie developer\" implies that they're not a professional developer in any sense of the word and don't have to be, they're just people doing what they like and that sometimes works out for them, sometimes it doesn't.\n\nAnd though sure maybe Eldrone might be out of a job, it's not like being hired by Mojang for a time is the worst thing that could be on a resume.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

Not to mention the server side resources needed to compute that level of physics and plug it into an emulated 100Khz CPU and output a response without lag - across an MMO universe with hundreds or thousands of players.\n\nI think they should aim for a sort of Star Trek style physics, where the physics exist.. but they suit the geography and practicalities of the storyline world. I'm not sure a hyper-realistic space simulator would fit that bill - and for people who want that there are already games like Kerbal Space Program.\n\nPerhaps in the interest of fun and education, they could cherry pick a few real life concepts and put them into the game.

{"body":"&gt; How is an emulator anymore illegal than an LLVM backend?\n\nThat's very simple, the LLVM is released under an open source fair use license. i.e they are **allowing** you to use it. Notch has not allowed you to use his DCPU. I (and many of us) assumed that at some point the DCPU would be released under such a license, but strictly speaking it hasn't been so your use of it in a competitive product could be taken as a copyright violation. But as I will go on to explain below, I don't think its the worst thing you're doing and I don't want you to get to focused on it.\n\n(inb4 everyone is doing it with emulators... try using the \"everyone is doing it\" defense in a court and see how that works out). It is slightly different with emulators, given that Notch specifically encouraged the community to make them.\n\n&gt; To clarify, are you claiming notch has ownsership of a large protion of these projects\n\nNot as far as I can see and I really want you to pay attention to this part, because it is the crux of the argument... although they work with or in some cases implement the DCPU (which is potentially an infringement) they couldn't be confused with 0x10c. **Your game, in its extensive similarity** could easily be confused with 0x10c, down to its curiously similar name 0x184. Both are space genre games. Both use the DCPU (only one of which is entitled to) and both have rediculously similar hexidemical names.\n\nAs Ghillie pointed out - if your game isn't, as you say it isn't, similar to 0x10c... then why are you even here on an 0x10c board talking about it?? Clearly your game is, from its inception to its current state entirely motivated by what you know about 0x10c.\n\n&gt; Your answer could engrage a lot of hard-working programmers.\n\nThat seems quite hypocritical, how about the programmers at Mojang when they see that you've ripped of their concept, their intellectual copyright and even the name of their product?\n\n\n&gt; Are you claiming notch has ownsership of a large protion of these projects. \n\nNo, don't know where you've got that idea from - violating copyright doesn't give the copyright holder ownership of the product in violation. I.e. Notch doesn't *own* their products because he owns the DCPU intellectual property. Although without a license stating to the countrary, he could in theory restrict use of the DCPU spec... clearly though that isn't his intention as he specifically asked the community to make emulators. I don't however remember him ever mentioning anything about using it to rip off his product. Infact, he specifically asked the Herobrines Army kids not to publish their version of his early implementation.\n\n-------------\n\nIt's becoming pointless discussing this with you, as you are so completely entrenched in your view that even multiple people telling you the same thing won't influence your opinion. I honestly don't think you've taken one thing anyone here has said on board, even if just to entertain it for a moment. You've obviously sunk a lot of time into your DCPU project and become frustrated when you discovered 0x10c was on hold - and decided to just bite the bullet and make a kind of 'fan-made version' of it yourself.\n\nAs I pointed out way back when you first mentioned it - I don't think this is the right time for such a project and I think your specific plan could run into legal problems if someone at Mojang wanted it to. Having said that, if you want to make a space game with a CPU (a freely licensed one that doesn't infringe on Mojang intellectual copyright) then I'm all for it and I look forward to see it.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"Hello, guys.\nAs I stated in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c/comments/1fcn39/spectroscopy_anyone/) thread, I am willing to help.\n\nI'm a computer engineer. I've been a C/C++ programmer for 5 years, then switched to C# in 2006, and since then I've been working as developer with it. Also, I've been a mathematics, physics and chemistry teacher for high-school students for a while now, and as a programmer, I've made some science-software to aid me in my teaching sometimes, so even if I'm not as valuable as most of the members here, I believe I have a little background to aid the development of a sci-fi game.\n\nI have enough knowledge about Java to say that is an awful option for a game. In a matter of fact, as I saw in many posts here, we might want to use an engine, since it would avoid many, many pains.\nAnd when we talk about engines, we have many options that can be narrowed down if we say we'll develop a community, unprofessional game at low cost. I even dare to say the best and only option would be Unity.\nWhich would be very comfortable (for me at least) because it's the only one I have some familiarity.\n\nPeople are saying \"unity is a bad idea for CPU intensive calculations plus graphic intensive game\", but if you guys think about Kerbal, it's all made in unity and works pretty well.\nI'm not sure what expectations you guys have about this game (regarding graphics mainly), but I don't expect it to be a Crysis 3. In a matter of fact, some N64 graphics would be cool enough to me, but I think the majority of people would agree with something \"PS2-like\". I don't think we should go for awesome beautiful graphics and voxel-based damage right now, at least not as the main focus of the game. But that's just my opinion.\n\nAlso, I have one small VPS with TeamCity configured to build Unity projects, which can access SVN/GIT repositories and create nightly builds (along with other triggers).\n\nI believe that for this kind of project, we would need to set some phases prior to taking any course of action. At first, I'd say we need to schedule one night time chat in some IRC channel where we can quickly create one document with what we want about this game. In this chat we can elect one \"project manager\" for the game.\n\nThis project manager could then choose who's going to be the game designer, the graphics designer, the sound designer and the software engineer.\nGame designer would define the way we would get to achieve the results we all discussed in the first chat.\nGraphics designer would choose and enforce one graphics style throughout the game - so even if we have many graphics personel, we would have only one smooth style.\nSound designer would be analogue to graphics designer\nSoftware engineer would not only manage the development itself, but also define the coding standards and enforce that we have everything documented at the same level. I guess this is very important, because since our biggest team will probably be constituted of developers - and we know developers tend to have their own cranks, if we don't have someone to tie everything up in few months we would end up not being able to reuse anyone else's code anywhere. We would not even understand our own game.\n\nI think after this is defined, the project manager could start top-down approach to the document we wrote and delegate activities to every designer/engineer, and each designer/engineer could refine those actions even more and delegate some tasks to everyone else. We could set up a trello to follow everything up.\n\nOf course, we don't need to enforce people to do what they don't want. Thinking about Trello, we could create every minor task there and allow interested people to \"grab it\" and work on it. Tasks which remain unassigned for too long can be dealed with individually by the respective managers.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\nMoreover, would you guys be available for a quick chat on this Sunday around 5pm EST? Shouldn't take more than 30 minutes.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"While I would agree with you that Notch gave the impression of something awesome was coming and then it sort of fell flat on its face, I wouldn't be so pissed at Notch over this whole thing.  Let him follow his heart and do the things that he wants to do and get over this.\n\nThe main thing is that Notch needs to feel inspired about writing software, and that hasn't been happening lately.  He doesn't want to turn this into a chore that must be done which is sort of what you are suggesting about creating the \"small team\" to work on this idea so he wouldn't be forced into doing all of the work.  At the same time, Notch has been hesitant to let others in on the design of the game (even when they were very good ideas) simply because it is still at the early design stage.\n\nThere is a potential that somebody could do to 0x10^c like Notch did to Infiniminer, thus come out with a really awesome space game that has a virtual CPU and some ideas gleaned from the musings of Notch but to take it in a new direction.  Heck, I wouldn't even mind participating in a community that might want to develop such an alternate game, as it could be fun by itself.\n\nI'm sure there are enough developers on this Reddit alone that Notch could even \"turn it loose\" if he wanted and oversee the development process and not even really have to pay anybody to do the development work.  A Mozilla-like license that would give Mojang first dibs on any content created with the idea but otherwise would be a share-alike (similar to the Creative Commons licenses or the GPL) licensing scheme would be my suggestion... assuming Notch would even want to go that route.\n\nFor myself, I expect that I'll see Notch get back into the groove this summer, especially once he has a chance to get hooked on the idea of using the Oculus Rift device.

{"body":"I think so far they've made a basic platform (i.e. a few walls with collision mechanics and some player models) to play around with while they thrash out what the \"fun part of the game\" will actually be conceptually.\n\nThats where I worry a tiny bit, because in MC the fun part was fairly intrinsic to games mechanic - e.g. it was fun to break blocks and build stuff. Zombies/redstone/pistons/the nether/command blocks etc. have helped to flesh it out and keep it interesting, but the core 'fun' part remains the basic concept.\n\nBut 0x10c will probably need more direction/planning for it to be fun. It might be that the real fun part is actually some sort of trading mechanic (like an auction house/interstellar marketplace). Alterntiavely it might be a very PvP/PvE focused 'questing' game. It could also be all about exploration or about unlocking a linear technology or skill tree. The DCPU will then somehow tie into those tasks. Personally, my suggestion to them would be to try and include some or all of those elements within a larger sandbox world - and let players choose.\n\nSo as much as I love checking on here every few days for updates, and my heart sinks a tiny bit when there aren't any, I appreciate this next stage is actually harder in many ways than what they've done so far. Because its 'drawing board' stuff, and the early decisions they make now will have ramifications for what the game engine can/can't do later. So they need to get it right.\n\nThe flip side of that is, I think Notch and Eldrone should bear in mind one of the reasons the community is so positively engaged with MC is because they have been involved in its development from a very early stage... and 0x10c will only stand to benefit from the same thing. And it doesn't take much really, a few screenshots once a week is enough to give most of us palpitations haha.\n\n\n**Tl;dr** - unlike minecraft, 0x10c is probably going to be more about the implementation than the concept... and that will take time. *But*... it doesn't hurt to keep the community engaged by spoon feeding them a screenshot every now and then.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

This is obvious and he recognised that himself when he gave Rodina full credit as a similarly minded game under development that predates his own plan.\n\nBut... the DCPU isn't just a technical specification **included in a game**. The DCPU is an integral part of his game concept - designed from the ground up by Notch soley for the purpose of going in a game. It isn't just some freely-licensed off the shelf CPU spec - infact, it was designed from inception to be an emulated in-game CPU.\n\nIf you can put the fact this is a CPU spec to the side for one moment, look at the DCPU as a creative part of his game, integral to its storyline plot, world and mechanic. In this respect it is clearly a creative component of the game and would be subject to copyright - just like ingame artwork or the storyline would be.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with you making a space game with a CPU - its a great idea, that's why we all follow this sub-reddit. But come on man, using the DCPU and calling it 0x184 is too close to home... even an informed consumer could easily mistake the two games.

{"body":"what im saying is, put yourself in their shoes and imagine what condition is going to change that will allow this game to be made?\n\n* They have so much money and such a secure revenue stream its not an issue.\n* They have plenty of time since they only have 2 other products in the pipeline and one of them is near completion. They also don't have other traditional pressures like shareholders.\n* Talent they don't need because their cash flow and status would allow them to hire just about anybody they want on the planet.. and their existing staff are very competent.\n* Technology isn't an issue as the game is entirely feasible and they have the cash they would need to fund any backend development.\n\nThe issue isn't to do with any of those things. The problem is it just isn't fun - and that isn't going to change, and it certainly isn't going to get any more fun by collecting dust on a harddrive.\n\nAs I said on another thread, I paint - and this often happens with painting. Sometimes you just get part way into a project and it isn't going how you planned. You are faced with a difficult choice over whether to cut your losses and move onto other things or whether to push on and damn the consequences, hoping the end product will turn out okay. One of the things that seperates an experienced artist from a novice is the ability to make the right judgement call. I think this is what has happened to Mojang - and by putting development on hold they have effectively shelved it. They *might* return to it at a later date, but if their experiences are anything like mine then they almost certainly won't.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

It also strikes me that without that, the game you are talking about making is already being made and is in a fairly advanced state (Rodina).\n\nIf you want an example of how the gaming community approaches those who rush other peoples idea to market, I suggest googling WarZ and DayZ... \n\nAt any rate, I would hate to *be a waste of your time* so go for it, I have said my peace on the subject.

{"body":"While I do appreciate your input about connecting this specification to your personal boot ROM device, I don't think this specification could in it's entirety be applied to your device due to the lack of space available, even at 64 words, due to the device selection mechanism. I'll still comment about your suggestions.\n\n&gt; Hardware conforming to you spec would have code call hwi z instead.\n\nWell, yes and no. The hardware ID is in Z, but it doesn't mean that it must stay in Z, it can be moved freely to any location of memory or register by the bootloader.\n\nBesides, as I said, your device is very likely incompatible with your boot device, so if a similar device is created for the official DCPU hardware, this specification would become obsolete.\n\n&gt; I would also avoid any specification of the content of the boot code. If there is a \"boot device\" attached, by the very nature of it we want to boot from it.\n\nThis statement is not very clear to me, so I'm going to try to understand and infer from it as best as I can.\n\nI believe you mean that you would not like any device to contain the boot signature listed in the specification. You do not want any form of definition to the bootloader code. You would rather boot from any possible device attached.\n\nContinuing, if multiple devices were possible to boot from, the user should select one, as there is no defined unique markers between, say, two M35FDs attached with floppies inserted. Or you assume that there is always only one device attached to the DCPU that can be booted from, so it should just go ahead and boot it.\n\nWhile this is a possible alternate method, the reason why included the boot signature was to streamline device selection. I personally thought the following three things should be considered true:\n\n1. That we should always assume that there might be more than one possible boot device.\n2. That we should always assume that a possible boot device might not have any reason to boot. For example, maybe I use a floppy just for data storage, and it doesn't contain an operating system.\n3. That forcing the user to choose a boot device should be considered a last resort.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

You are left with a really tricky choice about whether to just cut your losses and move onto something else or to press on and hope that the end result is okay. Infact, in my experience the difference between a really experienced developer and an amateur is knowing when to make that call. Unfortunately, Notch has made that call and decided this isn't worth pressing on with.\n\nPut yourself in Notch's shoes or try to remember a time when you threw the towel in on a project... you probably stopped working on it because something was preventing you from sucessfully completing the project right?

They have so much money they literally don't know what to do with it all. Money isn't a problem.\n\n* **Talent/staff** - Thanks to their huge income and a good reputation, Mojang can hire just about any developer they want on the planet, in addition to their already talented staff. Talent isn't a problem.\n\n* **Resources** - Even if Mojang needed to invest millions in establishing huge server farms to power their 0x10c MMO universe... they have the cash, they could invest if they wanted. Resources aren't the problem.\n\n* **Time** - Mojang only really have 2 products available, Minecraft and Scrolls. They also have a 3rd party game being made under license called Cobalt. But otherwise they don't have much going on. Time isn't a problem.\n\nMy point is this: I cannot see what condition will change, that will get Mojang working on 0x10c again.

I knew Notch's work ethic and basically said \"Hey folks, this guy isn't going to make anything on a grand scale\".  I got a shit ton of downvotes.  Everyone kept telling me just how great this game was going to be because Notch was on it.   Somehow, that meant this was going to be \"Elite done right\".  However, all I did was reiterate historical fact.  If you look at Minitales, the same *exact* thing happened.  Notch got everyone hyped up, was all gung ho about it and then quickly lost interest.  Minitales, 0x10c, Santa vs Cthulu....you name it.  About the only thing he can finish is those Lundum Dares.  Basically, anything that can be done in a couple of days.\n\nWhat, did you think millions of dollars would all of a sudden give him an attention span?  Unfortunately for the community, they bought his hype hook, line and sinker.  Then, as Notch so gracefully does, he put the blame on the community for building hype.  Except he is the one that made a huge announcement about the title of the game and put out a few ARGs.  \n\nPlease tell me: how is all the hype the *community's* fault again?","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

The DCPU is very extendable as is right now and could easily connect to some engine thrusters or radios or anything like that - which is fun.\n\nI've also done some stuff with planet generation (see a spammy version at [I made planets woot](http://ge.tt/9kgI9cW/v/0?c) (lol)), but 2D might be better and still entertaining for something like this.

In other words, the recreation is only as faithful as could be constructed by anyone who watches the videos of its use (not including the visible source code) on Notch's twitch account. It's also built in Unity/C#/Cg instead of LWJGL/Java/GLSL. The only exception I made was for the loading and saving of the room. I copied the file format of Notch's room editor save files exactly, referencing the Java source while I wrote it to ensure full compatibility. In fact, I was able to load the room seen in [this old video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGClWsQjFTU) in this new recreation ([image of success](http://i.imgur.com/GUq8m23.png)). Other than that, the recreation was written in a vacuum, ignorant of the Java source. In fact, Notch and I used different coordinate systems and while we both chose to use a 1 byte bitmask for specifying the corner states of build cubes, we'd chosen opposite meanings for 0 and 1, so I had to one's complement the corner mask and scale the coordinates both on load and save in order to be compatible.\n\nThe point of all of that rambling is that as long as I eventually redo the save file format, or get permission to use Notch's, I will be able to release the source code of the project without issue because it will be entirely my own work.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

The planets are not really a main feature, and you only bring the earth-like planet up. There are a lot more styles of planets in generation on the other planets as well as asteroids and space stations.\n\nYou say that its influenced on a technical level, but I can assure you that is not the case at all. My whole system of organization down to the render method is entirely different. Only because the textures are pixel-style, it's not a similar technique. The mods you describe work very differently: they have use one world and simulate movement by replacing the blocks in the grid. In starmade, every object is its own world. Also there is real block-on-block collision even for very big objects.\n\nThere is no crafting in StarMade, but a whole other system to manufacture. \n\nThe part outside the ship is way less important then inside the ship.\n\nThe reason planets look like that is a simple gameplay decision. Omnidirectional gravity on a cube based object would simply not work.\n\nThe only thing that StarMade really takes from minecraft alone is blocks.\n\n\nAgain, I don't mind if you don't like the game, but I hope I were able to give you some perspective why it's not a clone.

{"body":"The question implies an answer with some degree of certainty... which I don't think any of us can really give you except Notch. \n\nPersonally, I suspect that 0x10c as the community envisioned it (a space based 3D pixel textured MMO with an integrated DCPU) probably won't ever come out. Mojang don't have the stomach to develop it... let alone invest the millions of euros they would need into establishing a backend server structure that could cope with how popular this game is likely to be at launch (without doing a Sim City). It's not that they don't have the ability or the cash... they have both in ample supply. I just don't think it's the direction they want the company to go in and nobody at Mojang seems particularly passionate about it (I'm not sure they ever were really).\n\nHowever, I wouldn't be suprised if the DCPU wasn't used in another game by Mojang. The spec is pretty close to completion and already has an extensive amount of community support. It wouldn't be especially difficult to plug it into any number of games. These are just a few ideas off the top of my head...\n\n* A 'robot-wars' style game where you build and programme fighting robots AI using the DCPU and pit them against other players creations?\n\n* A flight simulator where you programme your own DCPU powered flight control computer?\n\n* A 'tower defender' style game where you must position and programme your defensive pieces using the DCPU?\n\nAs a few people have pointed out on this reddit already, games that involve programming have never actually been very popular and are extremely difficult to pull off in a way that is 'fun'. I always thought the idea of 0x10c was very clever, simply because in a lot of space combat games (like the dreaded EVE online) botting is a real problem... and 0x10c kinda circumvented it by making botting the point of the game. \n\n&gt; I mean Notch is already working on another game \"voxel dungeon crawler thing\"\n\nMy understanding was that Notch hasn't worked on 0x10c since maybe January time. Unfortunately for us, if you make your company $100 million in 1 year then your reward is being able to choose to do whatever the hell you want.

If you had 4 of these radios (not on the same plane), you could tell the relative positions of each radio to each other. Now, say a fifth radio comes into contact with these 4 radios. When pinged, it's seen that the serial key is not part of the group of 4, but its location can still be determined. Well, now you have a point in relative space to aim your turrets at.

Nothing fancy and it wouldn't need to represent a whole lot of gates, but something akin to a 100 gate FPGA or something similar.  The idea is that you could build your own circuitry similar to redstone wiring in Minecraft, but doing it in a slightly different fashion.  It would be easy to simulate as well.\n\nI also want to see a \"3D Printer\" put into the game as a way to rationalize how some equipment is made... as a way to make parts and pieces for various equipment items in a ship and as a way to make new ships or other stuff.  You would mine raw ore as the \"stock\" for some items, where each item would require a certain amount of some element before it is printed, but the printer takes care of the guess work for you.  Blueprints for various kinds of parts needed to build some machines could be scattered around as rare artifacts (or have some blueprints seeded randomly with some players... including new blueprints showing up from time to time with newer players suddenly \"appearing\" in the universe) where players could trade those blueprints for other \"essential\" items.  These blueprints should have the capability of being duplicated as well, so eventually established players could conceivably get \"all\" of the blueprints.... but it would take some real effort to get there.\n\nSome more complex devices (like the DCPU or some weapon systems) may need several \"parts\" before they can be fully constructed... requiring you to search further for those blueprints if you really want to build them.  Those parts can also have durability ratings on each separate part, forcing you to \"fix\" those machines from time to time.  You can also take existing machines and grind them up into constituent elements... feeding them back into the 3D printer for new parts as long as you had the energy to make that happen.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"I'm a huge fan of the idea of having bases on planets with sorts of radio towers: towers that, as you pump more resources into them (either initially or continuously over time), enhance the abilities of your ships communication and tracking systems while nearby.\n\nThis would make very settled places safe to be (and good for automatic mining robots or whatever), while making exploring new areas super exciting as you'd have to rely completely on manual controls, dodging asteroids and making nice landings and the such (not to mention running away from or fighting off pirates).\n\nI'd be cool if there was some kind of communication device along these lines too: something that had hardware specs and everything that you could attach to the DCPU and communicate in binary (essentially) instantly with anyone else, say, where each radio is given a 64 bit code or something. It'd be a tad unrealistic, but fun for game-play (and prevent the less exciting out-of-game chat systems). Also, if this system could lead to encryption/DDOS, or, say, attaching a radio to a mining robot to allow people to activate it with the correct passwords, the game could get immensely creative and complex, which is something it's already starting to do with only the DCPU spec released.\n\nFinally, some speech synthesis (I think notch was even considering this at a time) would be fun, if anything just to have it repeat quotes from portal in a GLaDOS like voice, inform you of an INTRUDER_ALERT, or, ([just pretend your name is Dave Bowman, you have a friend named Frank, and your DCPU named HAL is sentient and evil](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwBmPiOmEGQ)), after asking HAL to open the pod bay doors (please), it doesn't say anything. You wait for a bit, you then ask it again. It still doesn't respond, so you start asking repeatedly, \"HAL, open the pod bay doors please. HAL, do you read me? Do you read me HAL?\" It finally responds, saying (in a detached tone) \"Dave, I read you.\" Hearing this, you ask again, carefully \"Open the pod bay doors HAL.\" HAL responds:\n\nHAL: \"I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.\"\n\nYou: \"What's the problem?\"\n\nHAL: \"I think you know what the problem is just as well as I do.\"\n\nYou: \"What are you talking about, HAL?\"\n\nHAL: \"This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it.\"\n\nYou: \"I don't know what you're talking about, HAL.\"\n\nHAL: \"I know that you and Frank were planning to disconnect me, and I'm afraid that's something I cannot allow to happen.\"\n\nYou: [feigning ignorance] \"Where the hell did you get that idea, HAL?\"\n\nHAL: \"Dave, although you took very thorough precautions in the pod against my hearing you, I could see your lips move.\"\n\nYou: [pausing, appearing noticeably concerned] \"Alright, HAL. I'll go in through the emergency airlock.\"\n\nHAL: \"Without your space helmet, Dave? You're going to find that rather difficult.\"\n\nYOU: \"HAL I won't argue with you anymore! Open the doors!\"\n\nHAL: \"Dave, this conversation can serve no purpose anymore. Goodbye.\"\n\nThough speech recognition/intelligence might be beyond our modern day technology's capabilities for now, a simple means of putting in text and having it synthesized into a customizable voice could make this game pretty wonderfully creepy at times.\n\nAll this being said, whatever ends up happening to the game is fine by me (just speculation is fun from time to time), as even if 0x10c was left as just the DCPU specs, it's still something that has inspired tons (including me) to learn more about programming/start programming, which is amazing considering it's nothing more than a few text documents.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

For both instances, the amount of time invested in research -- learning the OpenGL API or not -- is the same, so in both cases the time spent writing a wrapper is simply unneeded.

This way the central  server remains the sole point of authority, but some of the costs are alleviated by harnessing the power of the players' machines. This also maintains player privacy, and makes meaningful hacking very hard, since the calculations for any given player can be spread out to ten random nodes. And if it uses certain types of encryption (it was homogeneous/homomorphic iirc) then the node could never give a correct but modified response, making the game hack-proof.\n\nThis is suggesting that each client includes a node that the central server can utilize for computation only, rather than each client having equal authority over the game state.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

For the grunt work items, like setting up functions, keeping track of local variables, there's really only so many ways to do things and the generated assembly is going to be what you'd write anyway. The language gets out of your way and lets you write the time critical bits in assembly. Some of the standard library included is written in assembly too.\n\nIt folds constants, and is smart enough to combine some things. For example, a naive implementation of dereferencing a variable might load the value of the variable into a register, than dereference that register. DCPUB is smart enough to skip the extra load into the register when possible. It has similar small optimizations scattered throughout.\n\nIt also includes a peephole optimizer which you can easily add peephole definitions too. It works on whole statements, replacing generated assembly with equivalent but more efficient assembly.\n\nIn the works are redundancy detection (verifying that code lacks side effects and can actually be pruned isn't simple) and the application of SSA form to assembly; an implementation of which could benefit other DCPU projects too.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

Figured that you've got to locate and initialise them in order to do things like prompt for a device or display errors, so you might as well save the next stage from doing that work.

That lets you pass more or less as much as you want and can pretty easily extend the amount of information passed.\n\nI might do just that. I just figured that I and J will barely be used (for storage of additional boot data) in the first place, and so the only data that needs to be passed is the device it was booted from. Maybe Z will be the boot device ID, and the stack can be additional data, if it's needed.\n\n&gt; Figured that you've got to locate and initialise them in order to do things like prompt for a device or display errors, so you might as well save the next stage from doing that work.

What would give you a real sense of the scale and complexity of your ship would be to control it completely in first person, presumably with the DCPU (or some sort of DCPU peripheral) as your input.\n\nAt this stage its hard to tell though, as so far we only have;\n\n    1) The DCPU (a 16 bit computer)\n\n    2) Floopy drive (? to store and load DCPU programmes)\n\n    3) Monitor and keyboard (? to interace with the DCPU)\n\n    4) '3D vector screen' (? a 3D model projector)\n\n    5) Sleep chamber (? a non-functional storyline device or maybe an instant long distance travel device)\n\nSo we only have some very basic inputs/outputs and a CPU. Presumably the ship will have lots more I/O devices - like some sort of engine to generate energy, thrusters to direct that energy into motion, oxygen generators, maybe things like hydroponics for food, gravity generators, temperature control, water recyclers, external/internal sensors, weapons, mining devices, shields/deflectors etc. These will hopefully tie into the DCPU... similar to how a redstone wire isn't much use without a torch (input) on one end, and a note block (output) on the other end. Only in oX10c the redstone wire is a very basic computer that can perform pretty advanced logic on its I/O.\n\nA good example of a simple DCPU task might be to install sensors in each room on the ship (inputs). Then loop through each sensor to see if it is active or inactive (i.e. someone is in the room or not). If they aren't, switch off the light (output) to save power.

I think he was referring to the Unity based character creator, the Java ship builder and the Java FPS style thing with a ship and a partially working DCPU console.\n\nAs far as I can tell, they never actually sat down and 'coded' the game properly. In one comment Notch even said he wasn't sure which language the game would ultimately be written in. Instead each of the things they made were like technology demonstrators, to prove the concept of the game and play around with the mechanics.

Normally, cpus have registers so they have a small set of internal bus-sized memory locations working at the same speed as the cpu itself and you can't have RAM like this. But DCPU does. Accessing RAM is exactly as fast as accessing registers. The only restriction is that, since the memory has much more cells than the register file, specifying a direct address takes one more cycle.\n\nTo answer ibbolia, the registers file is usually a small block of memory, embedded inside the cpu, directly connected to the cpu internal buses (the input and output of the cpu calculation circuits), made with the same components than the other cpu circuits and working at the same speed. They are also built with special circuits attached to them such as shifting registers, incrementing registers, same-cycle read &amp; write, etc ... \nIn some cases, there is even one (or a few) register that can be used faster than the others, at least for certain kind of operations. \nThere are also registers, such as IA, that are used internally but you cannot freely \"see\" (you operate on them, directly or indirectly, through a set of specialized instructions) and registers you don't even know they exist that the cpu is using transparently for its operations.\n\nHere is a diagram I made of what the \"internal\" parts of the DCPU could look like (not fully accurate and missing some functions) : http://ovh.to/GGU1","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

The font which was loaded onto the LEM at any one time would act like a cache, holding the most frequently used subset of the entire font.

Your game, **in it's extensive similarity** to 0x10c could be confused with it, and that in itself is willful **copyright infringement**.\n\nTry and exercise some empathy - put yourself in Notch's shoes. Imagine you make a space based game called 0x10c that features a CPU which you've written a specification for known as the DCPU.

{"body":"I've been looking through some DCPU tutorials today and it's suprisingly powerful.\n\nAlthough it could do simple things like loop through your lights and switch them off or open/close airlock doors these are pretty basic implementations... infact, they're the sort of tasks you can already do with redstone in minecraft, which is fairly analagous to an electrical circuit.\n\nBut the DCPU has so much more potential than a simple circuit. I can't see any reason why it couldn't be used to make a basic guidance/navigation computer. \n\nThe place to suspend reality is probably with the hardware rather than the DCPU. For example, in real life it is more complex than simply sending thrusters a command like \"pitch up 50 degrees\". But for the sake of making the game more fun perhaps you could send a signal to the thurster unit like;\n\n* A = Roll\n* B = Pitch\n* C = Yaw\n\nThen supply a numerical value to tell it by how much. So [B, 50] would tell the thrusters to pitch the spacecraft up by 50 degrees. How you connect those commands to your input devices would be your choice (perhaps a simple one would come pre-programmed). You could then write a programme to map each of those commands to the in-game DCPU keyboard. A more advanced implementation might even involve displaying navigation information on the DCPU monitor and a visual represtation of your ships orientation on the 3D projector.\n\nAnother example;\nMaybe when cloaked the ships thrusters have different limits. E.g. instead of a max-pitch angle of 50 its only 30 degrees under cloak. So you'll need to factor that into your commands... because if you give it a command like [B, 50] it will force you out of cloak.\n\nAs more ship systems get incorporated this would lead to real trade-offs. For example a highly manoeuverable ship would need to dedicate a lot of DCPU capacity to that task. Where as a mining ship might forego that in order to control other ship functions like the mining laser. Fighting ships might be very clumsy to manoeuvre but have very advanced fire-control programmes to target other ships. Industrial ships might not even have a navigation programme installed, instead they parking up in space and focus their DCPU on processing ores. Then when they want to move they have to load a navigation programme from the floppy drive.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"My hope was that the DCPU would be connected to the greater world through some sort of UART.  It is a \"primitive\" networking protocol that could also be adapted for network protocol stacks, but having a simple UART that in turn could either be \"direct hardwired\" into another computer on the ship or be linked into another piece of hardware that could transmit/receive on various \"channels\" that would be simulated through a common data channel.\n\nI even went so far as to write a UART protocol for the DCPU back a few months ago... it is on the stack here on REDDIT but it is also in some of the documents heaps too.  Note that serial data communication is about as old as it gets and is definitely a retro-1980's type of thing to expect from computers of that era so it is definitely in keeping with the back story of 0x10^c as well.\n\nAs for how the game simulates the transmission/reception of data thrown into the channels, I like the idea of measurable delays that would simulate distance of transmitters.  On a practical matter I wonder if the server side of things would be too complex to get that delay propagation to work correctly?  Dumping the data into a common channel that could be received by any receiver on that \"channel\" as raw data is simple enough.... just a memory location that could queue data into each user instance on the (real life game) server.  Interference from multiple players would simply be xor'd data onto any character being transmitted during that time slice.  You could even simulate \"background noise\" by occasionally placing a random character into this data buffer as well.\n\nI just think the propagation delay would be too much overhead to be worth the effort on the part of Notch for the very little benefit it actually gives.... even though it does at some realism to the game.  I agree that a few tenths of a second delay would be trivially easy for the DCPU to compute transmission distances with some sort of a ping protocol.... although should the radio transmission be delayed for seconds or minutes instead?  Either that or should the radio transmitter be considered some sort of ansible that can transmit universally in an instant?","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"Yeah, I also thought it would to. The idea was very creative, and I think we are all in agreement that the concept has the potential to be one of the most unique games ever made - in a genre of its own really.\n\nBut the fact the game will require such significant backend development and infrastructure (huge server farms and custom software to run the DCPU backend) made me think it was a pipe dream - especially when its only 2 people 'maybe' working on it. It would require Mojang as a company to go from being a medium sized development studio to potentially a blizzard-activision/CCP-games sized publisher/developer - with huge technical infrastructure and customer support to run a game like that. As much as they *could* do that if they wanted, I'm not sure Notch *wants* Mojang to be that kind of company.\n\nGames like minecraft, Kerbal and FTP worked as indie games because they are intrinsically fun to mess around in. But this will require a lot more development before it would be ready for release I think... I'm not actually sure the game suits Mojangs 'public alpha with weekly builds' style of releasing games. After all, poor initial reviews could be devastating (just look at Sim City!). Because to support the server infrastructure they would need to pull down a certain volume of monthly subscrptions - which people may pay once to mess around in, but won't renew monthly unless the game is genuinely fun.\n\nIf Mojang have decided not to persue the 0x10c concept further for whatever reason, I'd really suggest selling the idea to a third party studio to complete it. It wouldn't be as ideal, but the concept deserves a shot.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

When individual developers start a project, they can't stop working on it, but it's easy to get distracted / get to a point where you really need to think how you are going to implement something (which should happen in a game so ambitious like 0x10c is). The fact that Notch is his own boss, allows him to take his time. Other game companies like Treyarch don't stop development because they have (hundreds?) of developers working on the same project, and these can't stop working on it because you are forced to by the deadline the company sets.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

That's what it's all about anyway, having fun.  ","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"A site had a link here, first I have seen of this conversation, it seems to be about making a MMO Space game from contributed work of many people, and with some ideas of user scripting within a game.   \n\nThe discussion needs more then a thread.  If someone wants to peruse the idea, someone should set up a forum, with sub sections for different modules required, and threads stickies for the various tasks involved, including a few threads to discuss the tasks needed.\n\nFrom there, people could figure out what tasks need to be done, and who would want to work on such tasks, and what already assembled libraries and code is out there to use.  \n\nAlso sections for discussing, in modular form, the ideas of the game would be needed to know the development direction.\n\nSomeone is going to have to get a location, to begin organizing what seems to be many people that want to assist in the endeavor mentioned in this thread.   Such a person would be a good candidate for an administrative lead, although creative design, and project management leads would probably come from discussions in sub sets or sections of the forum.\n\nThe first task should be resource assessment and organization, to more clearly define the goals, and also to see what assets are available for the different needed tasks, including deciding what tasks need to be done.\n\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"We're currently beating our heads against the Memospore ARG.  Unfortunately we're very disorganized right now, and the \"best\" way to catch up is to read the google docs, but that's pretty hard to interpret.  And to make matters worse, you've got to have a very strong knowledge of Elder Scrolls obscure lore, which you can't just jump into feet-first since it's... it's just complicated okay?  Hah.\n\nIf anything, *we* need help, but it's such thick material that we can't easily integrate new players.  And a lot of the clues aren't the usual crypto or the usual ARG clues so there isn't a way to help out there, either.\n\nAnyway I'll sub here and toss my two cents in when something comes up.","subreddit_id":"t5_2vexk","subreddit":"1000thworldproblems"}

{"body":"Throw a little bit more credit to the \"discount\" barber. In NYC, quite a few will give the hot towel treatment just after they place some kind of thick, non lathering shaving cream on the face and then hit you with the disposable straight razor. Of course, they go in with the clippers before all of that to get the haircut and lines straight. They use the straight razor to clean up the lines. At the end of it all, might be looking at $15 and I always give at least $5 in tip. \n\nHowever, most of the Black barbers I've come across don't do this. I find this is more prevalent with Hispanic barbers (mainly older guys). I find that they're cool with Black hair because in the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, the bulk of NYC's Hispanic community, there are a lot of Black people with typical Black hair. So, they know what to do and what to watch out for. \n\nFrom my experience, the \"barber shop\" costs way more, $50-$125 for the full treatment. ","subreddit_id":"t5_2s36p","subreddit":"100BlackMen"}

He is a paparazzi because he hopes to touch upon whatever it is that makes stars so special. In each episode, there is a certain magic born of the illusions of night: dancing in the Trevi fountain, an orgy in a beach-house, a sighting of the Madonna. But each dawn reveals the true, disappointing nature of the night's illusions. Or that was my understanding, and it allowed me to make sense of the various disparate threads of the narrative.","subreddit_id":"t5_2uktl","subreddit":"100movies365days"}

I would argue any political message the movie may be trying convey comes second to both the family story and the themes the Giant must go through with uncovering what makes a hero.  Furthermore I'd say the message of \"guns don't kill people, people kill people\" is far more prevalent and in your face than any of the McCarthyism issues.  \n\nSorry if I'm defending this a little too intensely, I just hold this film in really high regards.

But Moonraker might be the silliest bond movie ever.\n\nI enjoy License to Kill too, if only for Bond going rogue and the final setpiece being a gasoline-tanker chase.\n\nI'd say Goldeneye is the peak of the Brosnan run, for sure. I, personally, didn't care much for The World is Not Enough, but I do think Tomorrow Never Dies is pretty fun.\n\nAnd then I'd say the best Bond movie is the new Casino Royale. I think it's the best Bond script for sure, and I think the directing and visuals are excellent as well. I loved Skyfall too, even though I thought the script was a bit weaker, due to the top-notch directing and cinematography.

And make no mistake, he saw a very clear division between those two categories. For me, the quintessential scene is when Wayne stands in the meadow, shooting buffalo, because everyone he shoots is another the Comanche won't have come winter. This scene captures the central idea of the whole movie, that Wayne is striving with all his might to find the girl he loves most in the world (probably his daughter, though the film does not say this explicitly). He is not trying to save her, but to kill her. His wild, thoughtless, self-destructive mania animates the whole film, propelling it forward.","subreddit_id":"t5_2uktl","subreddit":"100movies365days"}

His conversation with the priest was about 10 minutes of the film, and only one time. Most of the film in fact focuses on the relationships between Bardem and the two women. Such a beautiful film in terms of sound (especially music), editing, and acting (Javier Bardem is unbelievable), and it is gut-wrenchingly emotional. I think I ended up giving this one a 5/5.

It is indeed very difficult to be immersed into this film, but having done just that, I found the film very fulfilling.

{"body":"So here is my idea of what this movie is \"about\":\n\nIt is a vision of the future of humanity, when postmodernism and improving health care have rendered man immortal and nearly omniscient.\n\nMost people play a single role in their lives. That role is their own. The fundamental idea of postmodernism is that man has escaped the thin shell of individual experience and now exists in a space where they are aware of all the roles available, but choose none for their own. They may occasionally inhabit a role, but only for convenience or entertainment. They do not *own* it.\n\nThey also live in a world where death has ceased being an imperative, and has become simply another role they occasionally play. Several times, he is apparently killed, but the wounds heal and he walks away.\n\nSo this begs the question, what could possibly motivate someone in Oscar's position? He does not fear death, and he has a postmodern understanding of, well, nearly everything. He amuses himself by playing roles. It is my belief that everyone in this world is an actor like Oscar. There is no audience in this world, only roles being played. Perhaps he is being recorded, but I doubt it. It is the final form of reality television. It is not something you see on TV, but something you experience for yourself.\n\nSorry if I am rambling and incoherent. I haven't yet completely clarified my understanding of the film. But the more I think about it, the more I love it.

{"body":"I completely agree that Alien has aged better than Aliens, at least in terms of the overall look. The sets are absolutely fantastic and it looks cleaner and clearer than Aliens, which has a lot more grain. I think, too, that the wider aspect ratio used in Alien gives it a sleeker, more cinematic look. That said, the effects in Alien are a lot more transparent nowadays. For instance when they cut from Ian Holmes' head to the fake one it's really obvious, and that newly birthed alien running off isn't too great either. The alien hanging out from the ship at the end is clearly just a dude in a suit. The movie is still a 10/10, but let's be honest it has its limitations.   \n\nI see no reason to hate Cameron, though. Sure, Avatar wasn't a great story, I haven't seen Titanic but both Terminators and Aliens are class, so whatever. The guy can direct the hell out of an action sequence.

{"body":"I'm not denying that it is selective in its history. After all, the only way to gain any knowledge about what his last 24 hours were like would be to interview his friends and family, who would present a skewed portrait of him. How much of the turning-over-a-new-leaf theme was genuine? I have no idea, and honestly I don't care all that much. I viewed it as a constructed object, and I didn't really get too hung up on whether the events of the film actually happened as reported.\n\nI think there is also a danger in getting too hung up on trying to render moral judgments on Oscar, for good or ill. The film isn't trying to convince you of anything, except that he was a real human being. In the aftermath of an event like this, there tend to be two crowds that develop: one that says he was a gangster who reaped what he sowed, the other that says he was a martyr to the hatred of the ruling elite. What this movie did that I respect very highly was to break free of that continuum, trying to strain out the propaganda and come to a real, meaningful understanding of what an event like this entails. It is not an examination on morality; it is a celebration of life and a condemnation of death. When the dog dies, we are not meant to think, \"How nice Oscar is for helping that dog.\" We are meant to see the pain of death settling upon it, and dread the fact that Oscar will soon feel this same pain.\n\nA bit heavy-handed?

Gary Cole delivers the performance of a lifetime here, a silent hero thrown into a rolling sea of circumstance.

I liked it because I saw it as a satire of the horrible state of so-called \"teen America\", which is present not only in the events of the movie, but also in the audiences. The people who saw Spring Breakers are basically split into three groups: Liked it (for varying reasons), Didn't like it because too much nudity, and Didn't like it because Selena Gomez was not involved in said nudity. I'm sure everything people don't get or don't like is some sort of meta in-joke about how much teenagers suck, but it's not worth going into.\n\nAlso, some notes: Larry Clark directed Kids, Harmony Korine just wrote it. Vanessa Hudgens was one of the final two girls, so her part kind of warranted the \"ex-Disney star gone bad\" hype.","subreddit_id":"t5_2uktl","subreddit":"100movies365days"}

I rate it the best of the films. I watched it again recently and it had lost none of its power. I did not like #2 very much, getting bad reactions from the stupidity and gung-ho of the military guys. I liked #3, but the version with the dog alien, not the other version. I liked Resurrection a lot.

I don't know what it is with Inglourious Basterds that I like so much, but it might be that mix of western and war movie styles. Christoph Waltz and Til Schweiger are some of my favorite actors too, but in the end, it might just be the fact that it was the first Tarantino movie I've ever seen that makes me like it so much.\n\nAs for why I continue to enjoy it, it's that every time I watch it, I kind of pick up a new interesting detail of the movie or plot.

It definitely needed more songs in the style of Lana Del Rey's \"Young and Beautiful\" and Florence + the Machine's \"Over the Love.\" I suppose they were trying to cater to a larger audience with the incorporation of some of the dubstep and hip hop songs. Even if they did insist on using them, I feel it could have been used better.\n\nApart from those things, I pretty much agree with your review.

That being said, good on Villeneuve for making the progress in his career that affords him something more mainstream. His direction is still on point in Prisoners, so I can't fault him that. He and Roger Deakins made something quite fantastic to behold. The overhead shot of the search party with their flashlights and the speeding to the hospital scene stuck with me in particular.\n\nI think most everyone will notice the similarities to Zodiac.

{"body":"If I may, a few words in defense of Aliens: \n\nI love Aliens in part because it, along with two other films, reinvigorated my love for movies. When I got to college (i know, I know) I thought that I had pretty much experienced the gamut of what film could do for me. I'd seen so many action scenes, dramatic scenes, funny scenes, surprises, etc. and I thought maybe movies have run their course in my life. Maybe I was done being moved by those images on the screen. And that's when I saw Aliens.   \n\nThe movie blew me away. First of all, I will never understand why people insist on filing it away in the \"action\" category, as if to dismiss it as being less sophisticated than its predecessor. For one thing, there's no action for a solid hour. It's got more atmosphere, suspense and scary scenes than most horror movies I've seen in my life. To me it absolutely felt like the same world as Alien. Second, it has more depth of character than the first, develops Ripley more and features a better performance from Weaver. Third, yes, the marines take some getting used to. I kind of hated Bill Paxton's character the first time I saw the movie - he was irritating and over the top. I came to love him, but on that first run I didn't. However even disliking the marine characters couldn't take away from what came next.  \n\nRipley goes back. She takes the flamethrower and descends into hell, into the nest of those things to take back her surrogate daughter. For most of the final 20 minutes or so of the movie, there's almost no dialog. There are no other characters. It's just Ripley and her determination against the bugs, and it's beautiful. I can't remember the last time I have ever been on the edge of my seat that way, completely dead to the outside world. The only thing that mattered was them getting out. From that moment to the end of the movie was pure, unadulterated badass. It was everything I love about sci-fi, action and creature features all rolled into one.    \n\nSo this is why Aliens is a 10/10 to me. It's in my top 5 movies of all time. Obviously not everyone needs to think as highly of it as I do, but i do think that sometimes it's unfairly dismissed as being the unkempt younger brother of the more elegant Alien.   \n\nAlso - most people seem to prefer the assembly cut of Alien3, which I believe is the one with the cow. Why do you think the theatrical version is superior?  \n\n*EDIT: Damn, now I want to rewatch the whole series. My weekend isn't long enough.","subreddit_id":"t5_2uktl","subreddit":"100movies365days"}

You can't just have them sit back and think about what they've done. Now that those issues have been raised Soderbergh gives the audience some hollywood style thrills within the relatively real-world (albeit unusual) context that he's established.

If nothing else, it is absolutely original. Also, from what I have read, it is very truthful to the conditions that people actually live in. It is filmed on location, and most of the people on-screen are non-actors who live in the area. Some of the houses that were filmed in were so fetid that the crew insisted on wearing hazmat suits.

I'm not sure I'd want to seek out the 45 minute longer directors cut though.  I'm also less sure about what the movie tries to say about Herman Koto.  It certainly is possible that he is just a shell of a man now, but also possible the movie could have just been edited for it to seem that way.

{"body":"This is a silly movie that tries something it can't (and, imo, shouldn't) accomplish. The very idea that it would be possible for a father to shield his son from the horrors of a concentration camp and have the child believe it was a game makes light, however unintentionally, of the suffering and evil perpetrated on the victims. Congratulations on finding Benigni likable. I found him difficult to take, although in the first half he becomes a taste I could acquire as long as the film is sort of a classic screwball comedy. Once the movie shifts gears in the second half it totally falls apart.   \n\nThere is one scene - one single scene - that works the way it should, and gives insight into the kind of movie that the filmmakers perhaps hoped they could make. That's the \"spiders and visigoths\" part. That exchange was both funny and believable, introducing humor into a bad situation without trying to change the fundamental nature of that situation. Maybe a really touching screwball comedy *could* have been made about a similar premise - a father going to increasing lengths to protect his young son from something difficult - but it would have to be a comedy through and through, and it could just not be about something with the gravity of the holocaust. There was simply no way this film could have succeeded the way it is conceived.  ","subreddit_id":"t5_2uktl","subreddit":"100movies365days"}

Whenever someone tries saying that people were wrong for hating other races and things of that nature, I usually compare them to what I think is the biggest concern now, homosexuality. Many people I know think that hating black people is the worst thing in the world, but holy Hell if they see a gay guy, they aren't staying in the room long. I personally feel no hate for blacks, or any other group for the matter. But I do hate the blacks that think they deserve to be treated better than everyone else because of what happened so many years ago.\n\nIn fact, story time, I work at a high school over the summers, setting up computers and other new fancy electronic devices. And the occasional other random janitorial task, but those are my main duties. Anyway, this last year everyone was pushing for me to have a full-time position over the course of the school year. It really sounded like it would happen. But then some black student sued the school for some bullshit reason (she got into a fight, hit 3 other student AND a teacher, and was suspended from school - so were 2 of the other students. But since she was punished, it was discrimination.) and won the case. So I didn't have that job, and its still up in the air if I will be able to come back for this summer.

{"body":"I saw this movie a few months ago, and I hated it.\n\nMy hangups include:\n\n1. The yuppie \"villain\" never does anything bad in the film. He invests money in modernizing a local library, but the film never even considers the possibility that he is anything less than an asshole. When Frank steals the poor guy's jewels, we are meant to think, \"Good. That guy had it coming.\" What?\n\n2. Frank's dementia is applied very inconsistently. Not that I expect an accurate portrait of mental illness from Hollywood films. But still.\n\n3. Liv Tyler's character is incredibly annoying. It's been a while since I saw it, but I have a distinct memory of Liv Tyler saying \"But I have to go to Aaaaafrica,\" in the whiniest voice imaginable.\n\n4. Several times, character's motives change suddenly and without ample motivation. Frank goes from hating the robot completely and wanting to disable it, to loving it unconditionally very suddenly. The same could be said about Liv's character in her relationship with Robot.\n\n5. The ending has a Shyamalan-like plot twist. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I don't really like that sort of ending.","subreddit_id":"t5_2uktl","subreddit":"100movies365days"}

{"body":"Here was what I took from the film, and from the ending in particular:\n\nMaya spends the entire film with blinders on. She is searching for bin Laden, using any and all feasible methods. She does not stop to consider the morality of her choices (the most egregious of which is torture). I think that this is probably an accurate depiction of a CIA agent who is on a very specific mission. There is a great scene where Maya and some of her fellow agents are discussing torture, and Obama says something on the TV playing in the background about how the administration will not endorse torture, etc etc. The agents stare blankly at the screen and then go back to work. They do not react with outrage or even shame. That train of thought (what should we do, rather than what could we do) has no place in their job. She does not even seriously contemplate the usefulness of her mission. It is hers and she will carry it through until the end.\n\nFinally, when bin Laden is captured, Maya takes the blinders off. She stares at bin Laden's body, but it is not the triumph she had imagined. She begins to remember all of the people she or others harmed in their quest for bin Laden. She also begins to question how important capturing him ever was. In the final shot, with a metaphorical blood-stained flag draped about her shoulders, she is asked where she wants to go. Prior to this moment, she has never once suffered a moment's doubt about what she wants. Her only question has been how to force other people to do what she wants them to do. But in those final moments, the pilot asks where she wants to go... and she has no idea.","subreddit_id":"t5_2uktl","subreddit":"100movies365days"}

I always compare it to *Moby Dick* in that regard. I am in accordance with the majority opinion, that the scenes of slapstick detract from the film. On the other hand, I had a friend who thought that the comic parts were what really differentiated and elevated it from other Westerns.

{"body":"Basically I compare two Jackman moments in this to get this highs and lows. When he's in the car with Loki and yells about his daughter waiting for him to save her, I put that down as overdoing it. The scene I alluded to in my review was when [spoiler](/s \"he's looking at the photos and sees the girl's sock\"). I felt he played that like a pro. The context of it probably would have made it emotional either way, but Jackman sells that shit and it feels real. That maybe doesn't describe his performance on the whole but yeah it had its moments.   \n\nAs far as his performances go I think his Jean Valjean was stronger and one of his best (it was showy but it's a musical so it kind of fits). He got nominated for that but lost to DDL, no shame there. Don't think he'll get any awards consideration for Prisoners. I also enjoyed Dano.  \n\nI don't really know what to think of what Gyllenhaal was doing. It seemed like he was trying to add some flavor to a character who was hardly a character at all. To me when I watch the movie Gyllenhaal is The Law. He's The Police Officer. He's one wheel of several turning in a plot- rather than character- based movie. I don't say this as an insult as I don't automatically fault of movie for being about plot. And it's not to discredit Gyllenhaal's performance which is more than adequate, but he's definitely playing a type.  \n\nAlso, I'm one of the few who didn't love Zodiac.

{"body":"Nice review. As for your discussion topic, I was just having this discussion with some IRL people (!!!) a while ago. I think it would depend on what they are hating. If they hate murder, I don't think it's wrong because I think murder is wrong. If they hate black people, it's wrong whether or not they were raised that way. I think the question is can we blame them. I was raised in an extremely white school and am white, and so I didn't have a lot of exposure to different races as a youngster. There wasn't a lot of rampant racism, it just wasn't something that was on our minds. So when we did meet someone of a different race, it was more an anomaly. It led to discomfort, definitely, but not to hate, really. And the more you get to know someone the more any hate you have in you will be quenched by that person, if they are good and not worthy of hatred. I guess what I'm saying is culture shock does not equal hate, but it seems that hate would stem from a form of culture shock (all those who hate have culture shock, not all those who have culture shock hate).

Even the predictability doesnt really ruin it because the story isn't a who-dun-it.\n\nThe whole point is that you think you are watching a movie about one guy when really, you're not.\n\nIt is a film the rewards, *nay* demands repeat viewings.\n\nEDIT: Another thing to think about is that this film came out a long time ago (1995) and many aspects of more current cop drama/mystery/neo noir films share/stole certain aspects with it. Maybe \"plot-twist\" films like Shutter Island or Sixth Sense have ruined the movie watchers appreciation for films that tell these types of stories-within-stories.","subreddit_id":"t5_2uktl","subreddit":"100movies365days"}

{"body":"Spoilers ahoy.   \n\nI think the ending is excellent, actually. The last line spoken to Maya prior to that shot is important. He asks her \"Where do you want to go?\" At that moment the film leaves you a good bit of silence and space to think as she would given what you've learned about her over the course of the film. We heard her talking to James Gandolfini about her activities in the CIA. She has never worked on anything but Bin Laden. For over a decade her life has essentially revolved around bringing him down. Now that she has achieved that goal, where does she go? What would she do? She has no family that we know of, virtually no friends, she has in some ways lost herself, her fate tied to the enemy now in the body bag. It's like winning the superbowl at 20 years old - what's left to do? Now that the thing that mattered most to you doesn't matter any more (or at least doesn't demand your attention), what do you chase? What motivates you? Beyond all this, I think she's just completely overwhelmed by what has happened, drained more than she realized by stress mental, emotional, and physical. She realizes the immense cost of victory. I don't see her tears as unrealistic in the least.  \n\nI think you're oversimplifying the question of torture, as well. First, some would argue that torture isn't shown to produce any vital information in the film (I'm not sure I agree); second, the moral issue is more complicated than \"they do it us, let's do it to them.\" An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind, as they say.

I can give movies a 7.5, and that means they're between good and great. Unless your scale begins at 4 or 5, or goes up to 14, it doesn't make sense how 7 is average. And if your scale DOES start at 5 and go to 10, by using half points you essentially still have a 10 point scale. So either use 1-10 where 5 is average or 1-5 where 2.5 is.

{"body":"To put things in perspective, I was able to do over 20 pushups before the program. I started with Week 2 Column 3. It provided a challenge, but I was never stuck on any one day for longer than a couple of days. I quickly progressed to the next week at top speed, and that's when I crashed into the stone monolith that is W3C3. \n\nThat happened 2~3 weeks ago. Today, literally five minutes ago, I finally completed W3D1C3 for the first time. To work up to it I practiced the hardest set from Week 2, and then went through the entire second column of Week 3. I don't think many people actually finish the entire program, going from 20 pushups to 100, in a month. The numbers are a good guideline, but focus more on the progress you're making than the arbitrary number you're aiming for. It's easy to get discouraged when 100 is a far ways off from 33, but a month ago I could only do 28, and two weeks ago I couldn't come close to finishing W3D1.

If you're new to using your muscles this way, you'll be too sore after day two or three to do anything productive anymore. If you're used to strength training, you could see a lot of gain in the first 2 weeks of the program (so calendar one week) but then you'll taper off and won't make the type of gains the program tells you to expect after that. You can check out some stuff on /r/fitness or /r/lifting for more info, but the general idea behind it is the muscles need time to recover in order to perform at their maximum again, but waiting too long means less workouts and less gains.

{"body":"Sure! So first thing that I want you to do is hold your hands out in front of you as if you were going to do push-ups against the wall. Now, notice how your elbows sort of point towards each other? It's almost like they're meeting at a point in the middle between you two arms if they could intersect. I want you to point your elbows directly at the ceiling. Notice your hands also follow and now wind up turning counterclockwise (left hand) and clockwise(right hand). That is external rotation of the shoulder. You should feel a bit of tightness develop towards the back of your shoulder. Now, bring your hands back into appropriate push up position by just rotating at the wrist, and that should have your arms appropriately \"locked\" into place. When you're on the ground, a good cue would be to kind of, \"screw\" your hands into the floor. It's jsut a more stable position. You want to avoid internal rotation of the shoulder in general because if your shoulders are internally rotated, it indicates tightness of the pectorals and anterior deltoids, and possibly lats. You'll see this in guys with that big \"gorilla\" look to them, and people who have this don't really have good range of motion in their shoulders. They'll have reduction in the subacromial space , which can lead to you tendons rubbing up against the bursa which can lead to inflamation of the bursa/tendons themselves, and hence discomfort. \n\nThe 100push up program is good, but this much pressing really needs to be countered with like...twice as much pullling to be honest. Horizontal pulling specifically, because movements like pull ups (which use the lats, a huge internal rotator of the shoulder), only make the issue worse.","subreddit_id":"t5_2rrg3","subreddit":"100pushups"}

{"body":"Knee pushups remove about 50% of the weight from a regular pushup, but they limit what all gets exercised, too.  Shoulders, chest, triceps still get worked, but it removes a lot of the \"core\" work, which is your abs, pelvis, and lower back areas, which get worked simply by holding your body straight in the pushup position.  Core strength can limit how many pushups you can do, almost as much as upper body strength.  \n\nJust guessing, but somewhere between bathroom counter height and chair height should be about similar to knee pushups in about 50% weight reduction, but sticking with full body pushups, despite inclined, will help your core strength too as well as good pushup form.  \n\nCheck youtube for some quick videos on good pushup form.  Hands too wide or too narrow, can both make it harder.  \n\nYou might also want to check out this 100pushups program  \nhttp://www.7weekstofitness.com/programs/7-weeks-to-100-push-ups/ (free registration req).  \nIt's progression seems to be a bit more spread out, as well as several more categories of difficulty.\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2rrg3","subreddit":"100pushups"}

{"body":"For strengthening wrists/forearms, I recommend using a weight attached to a rod. The rod I use is 1\" dowel with a 4' length of cord attached to the middle. The cord is in turn attached to a 5-lb dumbbell. Holding the dowel horizontally, I wind the weight up one direction, let it down with control, and wind it up in the other direction. Rinse and repeat until it burns.\n\nLots of flexibility here to adjust as you see fit. Vary the load, vary where you put your hands (centre/outside), vary where you hold the rod (close to your belly, stretched out in front, behind your back). Vary the size of the rod (You have to grip a smaller rod more firmly). \n\nRemember that anything that applies torque to your wrist will cause them stress. Think about holding a heavy cast-iron frying pan by the handle and you'll know what I mean. A push-up applies torque is a similar way, and you want to try to minimize that torque, especially if you're in danger of hurting yourself.\n\nTo minimize torque while doing the push-ups, you can try a couple of things. You can move your hands more towards your head, so that your wrists don't have to be as flexible to get your hands into the same flat position. You can focus on keeping your elbows pulled more to your feet/sides (marine-style) instead of in the \"chicken-wing\" stuff you sometimes see. Finally, you can turn your hands so that your fingers are pointed more outwards, rather than inwards towards your face.\n\nAll of these \"form\" changes will decrease the amount of flexibility needed in your wrists, but they will make your push-ups more difficult. Overall, I prefer the [marine style](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG571YkA6-w) because it looks badass compared to chicken-winging it, and it just feels right.","subreddit_id":"t5_2rrg3","subreddit":"100pushups"}

I've seen it a hundred times.\n\n   It's like putting a powerful engine in a stock Toyota Tercel.  What will you accomplish?  You'll blow out the drive train, the clutch, the transmission, etc., because those factory parts aren't designed to handle the power of an engine much more powerful than the factory installed engine.  \n\nPush-ups basically only train the chest muscles and to some extent, the triceps.

And don't forget your cardiovascular work! \n\nI'm proud of you guys wanting to do this.  Three cheers!

Thirty to 45 minutes a day, three days a week, is all you'll ever need to do (I refuse to believe anyone is so busy that he or she cannot make time for that, especially considering how important it is).\n\nAnd don't worry about being embarrassed or not being in shape the first time you walk into the gym.

Morning, noon, evening. Now after 3 days doing so, you'll see that all your reps go up. By increasing the overall repetitions and by training often you build up endurance, so next time you'll not exhaust yourself on the first rep so the others fall behind.

I've mentioned this in some of my other posts, but I've seen people come to the gym and do two hours in the weight room repeatedly lifting to failure six days a week.  I've seen other people come in every other day or on a M/W/F schedule for an hour, put their sets in, and after three months they've made twice the gains as the dude who comes in completely overtraining.\n\nThe important thing is that YOU make progress.  Sure, someone might make progress faster than you, and that can be disheartening.  It's not a race, though.  Who knows what background, genetics, diet, or other stuff they might have going for them.

{"body":"It might not overload your body but it certainly isn't a smart way to train.\n\nBasically the only muscle your train are your triceps, chest, front of your shoulder and abdominal. This will create a muscle imbalance as you are completely neglecting your back side. Likely your posture will suffer and give you a hunched over look.\n\nSecondly if your goal is anything but muscle endurance (think getting stronger or increasing your muscle mass) this is also not a an effective way to train. Once you get past 20 reps you will mostly be training your muscle endurance instead of increasing your strength or muscle mass. If those things are your goal it's way more effective to make the exercises harder by doing a progression. Go to /r/bodyweightfitness for more info on how to train properly using body weight movements instead of just increasing the amount of reps you do.\n\nbtw. Doing such a high amount of situps can seriously harm your back and situps is general are not a great exercise. There are far better alternatives like planks, leg raises (you can progress to hanging leg raises easily), L-sits and ab wheel rollouts. Those exercises are all performed by using your core to keep your body straight and stiff (which it's made for) instead of doing a very unnatural bend at the waist (which also leads to bad posture if done too much). Using those exercises it's also more easy to do a progressively harder exercise which again allows you to train for strength and muscle mass instead of endurance.","subreddit_id":"t5_2rrg3","subreddit":"100pushups"}

{"body":"Yes, but why did he set a goal of 100 reps?  If he had used a different base, he probably would have set a different goal, and then would not have been within 1 rep of his goal.  For example we know he would do exactly 99 (base 10) reps, so if he used base 9, he would probably would have set a goal of 100 (base 9) = 81 (base 10), which he could easily accomplish, since he could still do another 18 (base 10) pushups.  On the other hand, if he had used, say, base 12, then his goal might have been 100 (base 12) = 144 (base 10), which he would have been very far from.\n\nThe point is that \"100 reps\" is a totally arbitrary goal, and the only reason it seems important is because for essentially meaningless historical reasons, we commonly use base 10.  This guy says that that last push-up has haunted him for years, but if he realized the goal was totally arbitrary, maybe he would get some relief.\n\nIf you don't buy that, imagine your goal was 67 push-ups, but you only did 66.

My drill sergeant kept getting at me for sagging in the middle when in fact it was my natural contour. After a while he realized it and let me be. You shouldn't try to push your waist back to get a perfect line from your shoulders to your ankles. That's just not gonna happen. Just keep your core tight.

So instead of [10,12,7,7,9] I did [12, 7, 9, 12, 5]. I guess it pretty much works out to the same total. It just made it feel less like a daunting task (IMO, anyway).\n\nNot sure if that's the recommended way of doing things, though.

Then work on that one recipe... try it a couple times.\n\nHere's something super simple:  get an english cucumber (usually long and skinny, wrapped in plastic).  Take it out of the plastic and wash it.  Put it on a cutting board or plate, and cut it in half length-wise, then cut those lengths in half too - you'll have 4 quarter strips.  Now cut them up into pieces about 1/2 inches long.  You can do a half at a time.  Now put those pieces in a bowl.  Put in about 2 tablespoons of sesame oil and 2 tablespoons of soy sauce.  Mix it all up and let it set for 5 minutes.  Pour them onto a plate and sprinkle on some sesame seeds.\n\nThis is a great snack - and PF Changs charges about $6.00 for this!  Of course, maybe this is one of those things you don't find appetizing.\n\nBut remember, fast food has been engineered to provide maximum brain sensation... salt, sugar, MSG...

{"body":"&gt; Would I be better off just going all the way through one routine, moving on to the next, completing that, and then moving on to the 3rd?\n\nA balanced routine is going to be better for you than just focusing one particular muscle group. Just don't try to go superman on us.\n\n&gt; Also, is it a bad idea to do the push ups and pull ups on the same day?\n\nLikely.\n\nThe push ups are going to work your triceps more. The pull ups are going to work your biceps more. Your arms are likely going to feel sore and then numb after a good set of either of these exercises though. Doing both on the same day doesn't sound like a recipe for success. Ideally I'd put a rest day between the two.\n\nIf you insist on doing them both on the same day, do the pull ups first. Collapsing a foot or two to the ground while doing a push up isn't likely to hurt you. Collapsing from a pull up bar might.\n\nAlso don't add chin ups to this routine. You're going to be stressing your triceps enough already with the push ups.\n\n&gt; Any tips on how best to try to do all 3 of these at the same time would be greatly appreciated.\n\nSit ups are easy if you can find a way to do them without hurting your back. (Some things worth trying: soft mat / bed, dropping knees to each side, legs straight, reduce the amount you come up, and not locking your feet under something. Keep your arms crossed though, this is a core exercise not an arm swinging exercise.)\n\nDo your other exercises first. Rest a bit. Then burn whatever energy you have left on the sit ups.\n\nI somewhat question the benefit of being able to do 200 sit ups actually.\n\nBeing able to do some will help with your core strength which will help you stay straight while doing push ups. That doesn't take 200 though.\n\nAre you hoping for a six pack? If so you're also going to need to burn off a lot of body fat. Otherwise you're never going to see those muscles. Sit ups aren't likely to help you burn much fat. Try moderate or long distance running perhaps.\n\nSpeaking of which are you doing any running?","subreddit_id":"t5_2rrg3","subreddit":"100pushups"}

No need to compare to others, just base how good it was based on how tired you are afterward.\n\n100 pushups is kind of a startup introductory affair. Its mostly designed for people with a low to medium level of fitness who need a simple, easy, structured way to work out without spending anything.\n\nThat being said, most people doing 100 pushups are doing it as the days work out. They might do pushups 3 times a week, then in between days do situps or C25K like I am.\n\nThere are not a ton of people drawn to this (at least from my observation) that have a full body workout regimen.\n\nYou're not wrong for doing 100 pushups though. You just have to work it into your routine. You have to carve out some space in there. Its probably not necessary to do more chest work, tricep work, and shoulder work while you're doing heavy pushup work.\n\nThere are a lot of options concerning a fitness routine, but its best to just stick with one thing for a while to see how it works. The best way to do that is to go into it with enough of an understanding to not spin your wheels the whole time.\n\nI might suggest reading up on the FAQ from /r/fitness, if you haven't already.\n\nCheers!","subreddit_id":"t5_2rrg3","subreddit":"100pushups"}

{"body":"If you're increasing at that dramatic of a pace, I think two things are pretty obvious:\n\n1) You're in way better shape than you thought.

I'm back to week 3 now and it's actually harder now that I'm focusing on form.\n\nThat said, it's certainly possible you just rock at pushups. In which case, keep doing what you're doing, if it works for you. I'm no expert but it worries me a little that you have shoulder pain that only goes away when you do a pushup.

You should really be more scared of countries like Pakistan and N. Korea that have nuclear weapons and act completely irrational at times (or all the time in the case of N. Korea). So by your logic she should learn Korean as well.\n\nAlso, just a little fact, 1 nuclear weapon could put the US on its knees.  If it is detonated high enough in the air above the continental US, the resulting electromagnetic pulse could permanently destroy all electronics throughout most of the continental US (and since everything runs on computers now, that means nothing would work, no power would be generated, no more sewage treatment, no more city water, no more anything). That is all a country needs, so you, according to your logic, should be scared of every single country that has even a single nuclear weapon.\n\n2) Yes, China's economy will get bigger than that of the US in the near future. So? China has 3 citizens for every 1 citizen of the US. It is only natural that they will have a bigger economy when the country matures. Also, quantity does not equal quality. Most of the stuff China produces is absolute shit in terms of quality, and until they improve the US (and to some extent Germany and western Europe) will dominate the high end manufacturing processes. Furthermore, China's economy is artificially supported, it will crash, and no one has that much of an incentive to help them recover from it when it happens.

She then asks if I just wanna have some fun, and I say yes, and she's fine with it)  I take her outside of the bar and we make out a bit, then she says that she has to give her friend a ride home.  I get her #, text her my address, and we go up to her friend and make a show of saying goodbye.  I go back home and about 45 minutes later she's at my door!  So I had my first successful f-close since I started running game.  Thank you Seddit!\n\nSo this one basically fell into my lap, and I certainly didn't run any masterful game on her, but I guess the numbers game finally paid off.  Besides, I never would have approached before, and certainly would not have expected that outcome, since her appearance was fairly conservative.  I also have learned enough fundamentals that I didn't screw up a good opportunity once I recognized it.  Guys that are reading this, if you are just starting out, make those approaches!  You just never know what will happen until you go for it!","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

{"body":"I'm back, dno how many people still read this a comment would be nice, I'm continuing my journey with PU. However since I've been doing this all my goals and ways have evolved over the weeks. I'm not saying I'm a pua but I want to share my experiences with the community.\n\nFirst: PU for me was just to prove to myself how many chicks I would be able to bang in a certain amount of time, PU was a great part of my life actively searching for opportunities. \n\nNow; I just got back from a festival called Rock Werchter http://www.rockwerchter.be/en about 80 000 people every day there. After reading up on PU I thought I was going to have such a good time there, which I did. One of the best life lessons that I've learned there, which is what life is about in my opinion, gaining as much positive experiences as possible.\n\nPU improved my life so much I can't thank this community enough, I feel like the trial and error of PU led to that one special moment, which I will talk about more later. Let me first get started with my sets in chronological order;\n\n16: My friend from Finland came over, I threw a party for him with my friends, just drinking and smoking some pot together, it has been a while since we've seen each other so it was a lot of fun. Then after the party we left my apartment to hit the bars. Being at the bars we see that there aren't a lot of people there so we try to make the best out of it. I spot a girl that i think is cute and start talking to her and trying to introduce my finnish friend to her. I think that's how I was on her radar because I didn't spend a lot of attention to her, ended up making out with her, touching her boobs, she with her hand on my dick at the bar and me touching her outside her pants. BIG mistake cuz i was so shitfaced, ended up seeing her again at Werchter cuz I thought we could bang there, Met up with her, she was like a HB5. We chatted at Werchter for a bit and then I said I had to go, didn't wanted to be an asshole. At the bar I was just very result driven, didn't really care about her.\n\n17; So the day after we went out and did set 16 I woke up and decided that I was going to the festival, just packed all my stuff the and 3 hours after getting up I was on my way to the festival, so spontaneous, love it! This set is at day 2 out of 4 of the festival. So i was watching the show of major lazer and I see this Chick dancing, Major lazer said to take of all the t-shirt in the room and hold em in the air. I told this girl she had to do it as well but I saw she was wearing a dress so we both had a good laugh about it, the drop comes i just take her by the hips and push her ass against my dick, ofc she notices that, just go in for the kiss and that was that, nothing more said, the rest of the concert she kept on dancing against me but it was just too hot for that it was like 30+ degrees inside the tent, so I just said to my friends that we were going, I needed to cool down. Girl was from holland.\n\n18; I wish this one was number 100, this girl really got me. As you can see I've already had 17 mention worthy to this subreddit. Which include some K,# and F- closes. I'm just trying to have fun. which is working out pretty good for me, I'm trying to regret nothing in my life but not like that YOLO bullshit. Let me sketch the scene real quick, rammstein concert at 12 pm, really dark and i took half a pill of ecstasy an hour and a half before, so I was pretty far away, the concert starts I'm just minding my own business trying to comprehend what is going around me(was the first time) I'm just enjoying myself and laughing. We exchange a few looks and smile, i see she is having trouble looking at rammstein, so I open with that she could sit in my neck in she wants to, but she didn't feel like it because she thought she was too heavy, I joke around and say that i lift, and that i'm the only belgium that can do that. She laughs then the concert continues, just having fun and at this point the girl was standing in front of me and i'm behind her about a foot away (30 cm). then this guy besides me starts to move slowly but surely in between my and that girl, I can see a PickUp move when i see one (a player recognizes a player really fast) at this point I'm giving 0 fuck and push the guy away gently while taking the girl by her hips pulling her close to me. at this point the deal is basicly sealed, i ask her name and she asks mine I ask where she was from and she asks me (she is from Switzerland) So after me holding her from behind her, I was just being alpha as fuck and just turn her around, and the moment she looks into my eyes I place both my hands in her neck and just kiss her.\n\n\nThis is the special moment I was talking earlier about, We start kissing and the kiss went straight to my heart, I swear to god i was instantly in love with this girl. The way we kissed each other was magical, I could feel the butterflies and I forgot the world around me, she was exactly my type HB9 tall blonde ( i'm 6ft 2\" so i'm pretty tall) we ended up spending the rest of the concert together just enjoying ourself, I took her in my neck and she saw the 20000 people standing around her, we shared a magical moment together. After the concert was over she gave me her number but my cellphone's battery was dead so i asked a random's dude phone for his phone so I could send a text. We met up again at the camping site about an hour after the concert. So then i got back to her tent and sat to talk with her friends, at this point i think i blew it cuz i was so far away i speak a bit french but they were propper french so i tried to join in the conversation but couldnt get out of my words because i was shitfaced and it had been a while since i've spoken french.  At this point i'm ready to bang her in my tent. I said to her she should come over to me and my friends tents to have a drink with us. She comes with me to see where i'm sleeping at. At the isle between all the tents I show her where I sleep and she said she will go back to her friend to finish the drinks they brought with them and then return. We passionately make-out then and there (she was the best kisser i've had in a very long time so delicate yet so firm) I touched her boobs which made her giggle. This comes the part I don't understand she didn't return to me. Maybe i should have brought up sex more so she wouldn't have thought it was just for having a drink but wasn't that obvious?? Anyway the festival is over now and I think i'll be sending her a text about how she made me feel and maybe I can get her facebook and work something out in the long run, I don't mind investing time in a girl i like Switzerland is doable if I really have to. I'll be picking up my French as well so I don't fluke out next time. She's been driving my mind crazy the last 2 days.\n\n\nIf I didn't started my 100set I probably would have never encountered that. This is how PickUp enriches my life to get experiences like this. This is the goal everyone should try to attend in PU. I'm smiling all day long, I'm mindblown how that one kiss could change my whole perception about someone. You will know when it feels right when it does, be patient. Things probably won't work out between me and this girl but I will have tried and I can't blame it on not being my very self and I will be damn proud of it if i try and fail rather than not have tried and wondered all the time.\n\nThanks for reading if you came this far this came straight from my heart.\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

{"body":"Yeah you and I are going through similar phases. Except Im in california, and you're in Australia. I have heard australian women are beautiful...but there is still some racism prevalent there...or so i've heard from some friends that have spent time there. I've blown it with some beautiful women too...but you live and you learn. That's why we date...to grow individually...and learn about these creatures from Venus. My dating/relationship IQ is really high now...but it won't bring any of my ex's back. Truth be told, I got use to a \"player mentality\" because my childhood friend was Mexican and his mentality was to \"date many girls\". This mentality made it really hard early on for me to sustain a relationship...because i would be dating a HB6-7....but then in the back of my head was out there looking for an 8,9,10. I was a lot more shallow...and I would strain the relationship and at some point the girl would leave me. That being said.... I want someone i'm attracted to... whether thats an 8-9-10...but also with emotionally chemistry. I'll settle with an 8 on a scale of attraction....\n\nYou are still quite young. I don't know what your degree is in, but I would beef up your resume and reach out to recruiters in melborne that will help you find a job there. I would also go to the extent to fluff some info on the resume ... if you have a family friend that runs a business, just give yourself a sales title etc... and put them down on your resume. If you go through recruiters, your employment prospects will greatly improve. Which i am certain you are well aware of.\n\nMy personal take on service jobs are a great way to meet women. You just have to be careful that you don't do it sloppy. Very subtle, just flirt a little here and there. So I would network with recruiters, keep the $23/hr job...save up...and once a recruiter lines something up, you are set...\n\nAlso another recommendation, if you do move out... live with a female roommate! Or share a 2 BR apt. with a female...you can't go wrong with that.","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}
{"body":"So I wanted to give myself something of a mini-challenge this day.  Figured it was time I tried out some daygame, so I challenged myself to do 10 daygame approaches.  It didn't quite work out like that, I only managed to do 3 the whole day.  My plan was to go into the city (SF) as early as possible (ended up procrastinating and not getting in until the early afternoon), and just walk the streets doing approaches.  \n\nI passed up so many opportunities (day game is not easy!  Well, I'm sure it will be eventually, but it is so far out of my normal realm of experience that it *feels* damn hard), but I did manage to make my first 3 direct/daygame approaches!  Here's how they went down:\n\n10)  Blonde HB8 walking towards me on the street.  I stop her and ask her for directions to the BART.  She gives them to me and I say \"Actually, I already knew how to get there, I just wanted an excuse to flirt with you.\"  She seems taken aback, but talks with me for a little bit, maybe 2 minutes.  Don't really know how to continue after a direct opener, so I stumble a bit for conversation.  She pretty quickly begins trying to walk away, saying she has to meet her friends, clearly not interested.\n\n11)  After many missed opportunities (Feel like I spent the whole day just hiking around the streets), I see an Asian HB7, again coming towards me.  I decide to be even more direct this time.  \"Hey, you look really cute, and I'd be kicking myself if I didn't come over and say hi.\"  She turns out to be Japanese and speaks very little English, I don't think she understood what I was saying.  She says she has to pick up her daughter and ejects.  Oh well, next.\n\n12)  Again, more missed opportunities.  I see another blonde HB8 approaching on a semi-busy street.  I do the same as above, \"look good, kicking myself, yada yada\"  She really likes it, but says she has a bf.  But she does seem surprised, flattered, and happy, and she tells me that it was really nice and brave of me to stop her like that.  I probably made her day!  \n\n+s:\n\n-First daygame approaches, also went direct for the first time\n\n\u0394s:\n\n-Need to learn to be comfortable transitioning into teasing, kino, and/or qualifying after daygame openers.\n\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

{"body":"Update so far:\n\nDay 1, opened three 1-sets, the third of which was awesome because I was crossing the street, happened to make eye contact with the girl, held it (not my default) and what's more, smiled and waved. She returned both, I closed the distance without getting hit by a car and opened.\n\nDay 2, went to see a friend's band play at a DIY type underground venue and talked to a bunch of people. I opened a 2-set on the way in, chatted for a minute, crossed the room and opened the girl playing piano. Got her card, she turned out to be playing in one of the bands later. Both these were pretty easy / low risk for me. But the third set was the one I want to focus on, this was the singer of one of the bands, I watched their set and made eye contact with her while they were playing. Thinking \"she's cute!\" then afterwards I found her outside, told her how awesome I thought their show was (truth!) and together we watched another dude play some songs outside. I talked to her after the music ended, trying to see what she was like. She seemed into me, kept smiling at what I was saying (talking about music) but wasn't showing herself much in her responses. I actually said \"So I'm curious about you, what's your story?\" very genuine and she came back with \"aw, come on, that's such a line\" with a smile. I protested that it was the truth, she said \"I'm gonna go chainsmoke over there, want to join me?\" and we went off but got caught up in another group. Got separated, I went inside to watch the last band (who fucking killed it) and then I couldn't find her afterwards! Hung around and chatted with folks, looked for her a minute but said \"fuck it\" and went home soon after.\n\nAnyway it was a good interaction, I felt like I was being myself. Do wish I had put my arm around her while watching the guy play outside. Would have pushed things along quicker.\n\nSo I'm up to 6 sets so far (only counting women and mixed sets) and it's the beginning of day 3. Tonight I'm going to a Meetup and will doubtless have some more opportunities to connect there. According to my calculations (nerd) I should be shooting for ~16 approaches / week if I want to hit my target by the new year.","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

{"body":"Yesterday I did about 11 sets. I recorded them on my phone just so I could remember them all. So this is **29/ to 39/**:\n\n**29/** HB 7.5 short girl with humungous tits. I go up to her from behind , tap her on the arm and say,\"Hey I saw you from over there and I think you look absolutely gorgeous! So gorgeous I forgot my pickup line.\" She has this WTF look on her face, says a really slow \"Thank You\" and starts walking away. I say \"Have a nice day!\" and get outta there. \n\n**30/** HB7.5 Bust girl wearing a light green top. I run from behind, tap her arm, go direct. We talk for a bit, but she says she is committed to someone else. \n\n**31/** HB 6.5 Older woman with a paisley skirt and black top. I compliment her on her style. She thanks me and asks me if I'm a student at the University. We talk a bit about school and she says she's a staff member and her husband is a TA in my program. I smile, tell her it was great meeting her and get outta there. \n\n**32/** Two set of Asian girls. This I did with my buddy. He opens them and I continue the conversation, asking them whether they're sisters or not. One of them is Chinese, the other is Korean. I tease them by calling the Chinese girl the evil one and the Korean girl the nice studious one. We talked for a bit longer, and found out they were high school students so we GTFOed. \n\n**33/** Two set, cute sisters. I go up from behind them, they are a bit startled. I tell them, \"I saw you walk by me and I just have to say you two are absolutely gorgeous. Are you sisters?\" They say yes, and I tell them,\"Oh now I see it, it's in the eyes.\" One of the sisters quickly tells me they have to go to class and they leave. \n\n**34/** HB 6 Asian girl with big tits walks past me. But I go for it anyway. I go direct on her and she's happy about that. She gives me her number and I tell her we should hang out sometime. \n\n**35/** HB 6 blond girl who I see from inside the library. I run up to her and go direct. She's kinda creeped out. Says thanks, smiles and starts walking away. I ask her what she's up to and she tells me she has a boyfriend. I promptly bid her adieu.\n\n**36/** HB 8 with gorgeous eyes and great body. I see her walking out of the library. I immediately run after her, tap her on the arm and go direct (\"You are soo gorgeous, I forgot my pickup line\") She's laughing, but kinda nonchalant about everything, which is good. We talk a bit about what we do and I run outta things to say. So she says she has to go so we say our farewells. I feel like shit cuz I choked. \n\n**37/** HB8 with shades that I see outside the library once again. I run up to her and say, \"I saw you passing by and I just have to say, you have the most gorgeous eyes ever.\" And she's wearing shades! So she says,\"But you can't even see my eyes!\" I say,\"Of course I can see your eyes.\" We go nowhere in the conversation. She says she has a boyfriend so I just eject. \n\n**38/** I make the mistake of approaching her from behind in a relatively dark spot near the entrance to the library. I go direct, after which I stack an opinion opener on top of that. The conversation is going pretty well, but she cuts it short cuz she needs to go somewhere. On top of this I make the mistake of asking for her # which she clearly does not want to give me. And my delivery was really poor towards the end cuz I started getting nervous. She says she'll see me around and so we part ways. I learned a tremendous amount from this set, just because I was aware of my delivery of the number close. I began stuttering a bit, and worse is I asked for it (e.g. May..Maybe we should exchange numbers?) instead of just saying \"Give me your number\" or \"We should exchange contact information\".\n\n**39/** HB 8 blond Asian. I approach her direct, we have some really good conversations and I tease her lightly about her hair and her personality. I try to convert this to an instant date. We go to Subway together and then to Tim Hortons. But she ends up saying she has a boyfriend, although she did like flirting with me. At this point, I tell her that I'll catch her later and eject. All in all, a good set, except for the bf part. \n\nFrom these sets I've understood that I need to create more material cuz I find that I'm running out of things to talk about. So far I've stacked an opinion opener on top of my direct one and I also do the finger routine on top of this. Anyone have some suggestions?","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

I say bye back and head in the opposite direction.  \n\n**63/** HB5 Asian: I start walking around this new campus and I'm wondering where the hell I am. I start walking in the same direction as this asian chick so I decide to approach her. I go indirect:\"Hey do you know where Blah blah street is?\" She has nooo fuckin' clue and I eject cuz I don't find her attractive.  \n\n**64/** HB8 Blonde: I see this chick when I'm walking along this campus food court area. I open her direct as usual. She says she has a boyfriend. That was her immediate reply. Since it's been awhile, I didn't know how to respond to that properly and she says bye. That was that.  \n\n**65/** HB8.5 Asian: This chick was drop dead gorgeous. I would have killed myself if I didn't approach her. So I did. I went straight up to her and went direct. \"Hey I saw you from over there and just had to say, you look absolutely friggin gorgeous. I had to come and say Hi. I would totally regret not talkin to you today.\" She was really receptive. I made a bullshit story of how I was gonna meet my friend. She asks where but I have noo idea which building. I tell her I'm not from here and that I'm working here though. I ask her for her name and intro'd myself. She says she'll see me around campus but seemed hesitant to give out her digits.

She says she's late for a bus and starts walking away.  \n\n**67/** HB8.5 Black: This girl was super receptive too and kept saying I was sweet.

Looking back I could have asked her for some coffee later and her number. I was glad i took something away from it though. I also learned rejection really isnt a big deal after the 6 blow outs.

The place was packed with dudes and 3 women.. the only one that actually was worth going for was the hottest 18 year old girl I've seen in quite some time (thought not been commited to going out and meeting hot girls). Saw her going up to the bar while talking with my friends and didn't approach..\n\nWhen it was time for me to leave I saw her on my way out and just went up to her and said Hi, something something(I was almost speechless but pulled it off) and got it rolling with her, she was twirling her hair and her dad comming back with a guy and inviting me to sit haha. Escalated while building rapport, talking about how they ended up here and what she does. #-closed her to meet up in the week. Was about to leave and my friends show up talking about going to another place. \n\nBefore they came I talked with the girl about going home for work in the morning but now I invite her to come with us after I've talked some with my friends outside. She says she will call me after another drink here, \"alright see you later\" I say.\nLong story short I end up waiting for her alone, she comes with dad + guy. Me wanting to take a walk with her, but she doesnt want to leave her dad and energy gone from before. I text her on the way home see you in the week in my area without getting any response.\n\n\nNice experience, and how easy it was with a confident approach to hook a young girl. \n\n\nTL:DR Walked up to hot 18 year old in gaybar, said HI. #-closed.

{"body":"phew, what a crazy week it has been once again, I barely have time to go onto reddit anymore. So firstly i'll tell you what all I've been up to this past week, this is starting to become my little personal blog, but I think you guys need this background info because it really comes down to working on your inside first and then collecting the rewards of your work later on, on the outside.\n\nIf you think you're living the life as you think is right, people will notice and automatically you will attract all the people that will be interested in you more quickly and efficiently. Being your true self. In my case this is to get new experiences and developing yourself for the future. \n\nIn the past week I've been practicing my languages a lot due to a lot of travelling, I've been to paris for 3 days to visit friends and my niece and to rotterdam and eindhoven for 1 day to chill with my best friend and today playing football with other friends.\n\n\n20 (in paris): Me and my friend just riding the metro to go have a drink, I see this girl sitting in the metro HB 6.5-7, I see that she's smiling to me, I smile back and for next 5 min before we get to our stop we make eye contact for a few times. We get off the metro and she does to, I'm not really paying attention to her cuz I wasn't that bothered and it was so damn hot. We go above ground and my friend is looking for a way to get to the bar. The friend of the girl comes up to me and asks if I speak english, I answer \"yea I do\", she says to me that HB 6.5-7 thinks i'm cute, I say \"thanks she is too, what are you guys doing tonight? trying to make them come with us cuz they seemed ok\" they say like oh we're going out to a bar and my friend tells em where we are heading, I say they should come over to that bar too and walk away, 15 meters from them I'm thinking to myself fuck they've caught me really off guard (first chick that did that in a very long while) and I want to recover myself and ask em with us straight away or ask her number to meet up later, look at my friend and discuss it with him, he's not really up for it so I didn't do it. Made me think how I should react in such a situation when a girl approaches me and to be honest I haven't quite figured it out. Should be easy enough but it really make my brain fart.\n\n21 (still in mothafacking paris): My friend needed to work that day so I had that day to myself, I thought to myself to try out some solo-day-game at the Eiffel tower, most romantic spot you can think of in paris. If it wouldn't have worked out like it did I would have probably read my game of thrones book there in the grass. I'm walking alone towards the eiffel tower, have to wait at a pedestrian cross at a light, see this HB 9 standing 2 meter away from me. The light hits green and I'm checking her out, i'm like daaamn she fine. Start walking to cross, after about 20 meters of walking i go up to her asking some stupid question of where I could find the nearest metro station, doesn't really matter what u say at first really. She tried to explain and I said after her explanation that I was there alone and had some time to kill, asking her if she wanted to grab a drink with me, she looked at me and laughed for the first second and said yea ofcourse, I grab her by the arm for the first 5 meter to show her that we are actually doing this. Had a good time with her, we exchanged details and broke off because I had an appointment with my niece and she didn't have a phone, kissed her goodbye on the cheeks. Might see her again cuz she lives there in Paris and I'll probably go back in a month or 2-3. I only live like 2-3 hours away from Paris.\n\n22 (paris) : Me on the metro reading my game of thrones book, then a bunch of Brittish girls get on and just stand there and look around, I notice HB 8 she notices me, I'm like 3 min from my stop away and in a hurry cuz I needed to catch my train back to belgium, After our first eye contact I hear the girls giggling, I look up again, see them all looking at me, they quickly turn there heads cuz girls are shy ofc. I'm just thinking about catching my train, look up again like 30seconds later cuz we were at the 2nd to last stop, make eye-contact again and smile to her, we have like a full on 3second smile at each other and i'm feeling good and confidant she breaks first and looks at her friends who are looking like she just did something crazy and they are giggling. Get to my stop, need to jump out and run to catch my train, missed opportunity but the eye contact was good, paris was/is legendary for me and I'm definitely going back there. My life's awesome at the moment!","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}
{"body":"Had a fun night last night. I really think this was the most fun I've had going out, ever. AND I learned a lot in terms of pickup. Here are **#2, #3, #4, and #5**.\n\nYesterday there was a \u201cbar crawl\u201d type event in the city where I work. Originally, I was apprehensive about going out, but enough people asked me to show up that I succumbed. I told my close friend, T, about this thing. This was his home town in high school, so he had friends around there and he decided to show up as well. \n\nI texted everyone that had asked me to make an appearance, and nobody texted me back promptly, so I made my way to one bar that I like to wait for T (since I knew he was coming, just a question of when).\n\n**#2** I walked into the bar and ordered a beer at the \u201ccraft beer\u201d bar, which is separate from the \u201cmain bar,\u201d and I continued into the bar proper. I instantly saw one of my coworkers. She was already VERY drunk. I approached her before I could think about it, and noticed (too late) that she was already talking to some guy (pretty dashing fellow) next to her. I started talking to her and I guess I engaged her enough that she started ignoring him, so the guy turned around. That kind of made me feel like a boss. \n\nNow, I *know* that I have a very friends-only relationship with this girl, but I figured I would use her as a warmup. I started touching her back and arm while talking to her, fixing her hair, etc. Then, suddenly, she said \u201chold on a minute\u201d and left (bathroom?). I had no intention of actually waiting, so I made my way further into the bar. \n\nI saw more of my coworkers towards the rear of the bar. I came up and greeted them all. At this point, they were drinking from about 3pm (and some earlier than that), so they were all pretty drunk. I was totally sober. **#3** I was approached by my coworker\u2019s girlfriend (this part is weird) pretty quickly. She was dancing with me and rubbing up on me. I was kind of taken aback by this, but I played along for a bit. She started telling me \u201cGod, you\u2019re so hot. If I wasn\u2019t dating XYZ, I would fuck you.\u201d We fucked around and laughed for a bit. She was getting kind of close, though, so I backed out of the situation. I mean, she\u2019s my coworker\u2019s girl...\n\n**#2 revisited** The first coworker I saw came back at this point and started talking to me. I continued kino\u2019ing her, rubbing her back, hugging her, playing with her beads, etc. \n\n\u201cJameson on the rocks, anyone?\u201d A voice came behind me. I recognized it as my buddy T. He came by with his friend B and two girls, all friends from high school. I ditched my coworkers for a little to shoot the breeze with T and B. The two girls stood separately and talked. **#4** After a little while I approached the two girls. I spoke to them for a long time: cracking jokes, kino, etc. They ate it up. One of them was wearing these tight green pants (it was a St. Patty\u2019s Day thing) and she was LOVING it. She was making funny faces with me all night, taking pictures, etc. We sent some snapchats to some of her/my friends. In one picture, the girl turned to kiss me on the cheek. I went back and forth between these two girls, T+B, and my coworkers all night. Right before we decided to head over to another bar, I was flirting with the green pants girl and I ended up asking for her number. She gladly gave it to me. *SCORE.*\n\nI later found out that this girl is B\u2019s girlfriend (I don\u2019t know the guy that well but he\u2019s a really good guy and he\u2019s a good friend of my buddy T). I don\u2019t really plan on following through with this number for this reason, but it is still a huge confidence booster.\n\nCool night: lots of fun. I really enjoyed myself.\n\nEDIT: I forgot, I also hit on the bartender in the place for a bit. I got a drink and commented on her skirt (short green skirt, matching the other bartender).\n\n**#5** \"Green is a good color for you. Are you obligated to wear that outfit on a day like this?\" I inquired.\n\nShe laughed: \"Everyone's asking that tonight! No, we just decided to match!\"\n\nI laughed \"You did good!\" I extended my arm, and she took my hand. \"I'm bdzevel! What's your name?\" She told me her name, but it was kind of hard to hear. It sounded like \"Nirvana.\" At least, that's what I heard. We exchanged a \"Nice to meet you,\" then turned around and talked to my friends. Over the course of the night, I spoke to he bartender a handful of times more, trying to joke a bit (but it was pretttty busy).","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

I'm feeling good, might as well drive like it!  I meet up with him and one of his buddies he dances with.  They were just at a jazz concert and were on the fence between two places.  I tell him I am out of my comfort zone at one of them cause all of the 6' 4\" Duke Nukem types and say we should go there! Nothing ventured nothing gained.  I have a bottle of vodka and a bottle of rum which I'm not drinking cause I gave that shit up, and tell them that they need to drink it so it stops tempting me!  I'm a bad influence and i love it.  We stop by a few bars and do some break dancing on open floors and dance with ladies on crowded parts.  Life is good not giving a fuck, and all the ladies are loving us, the only guys dancing harder than the girls!  I approach two girls and a guy at the counter and say hi, I start making great conversation with her and say I'm gonna get your red lipstick all over me when I kiss you and go in for the kiss.  She says she has a boyfriend and I tell her I have a gold fish, she eats it up and I say she needs to come dance and get wild! As I am bringing her out to the dance floor the guy in the group grabs me and says Hey, I'm her boyfriend.  I pat him on the back and say hey man, you can't blame me for wanting to kiss you girl friend, she is Smoking Hot and a wicked fun time to talk to!  He smiles and says I'm right and I ask his name. He asks me why I want to know and I say that both the girls names start with K and if yours does two that makes you guys the KKK and this will get really weird.  He says his name is Chris... \"with a C\" and I say we all dodged a bullet and tell him to have a good night with his smoking hot girlfriend and continue dancing.\n\n**Set 41:**  We go over to this sheik club and start dancing again. I go up to a few girls to chat and end up chatting with everybody in this social circle. They all work for the airlines and I have a good time dancing with them. Then I spot this cute Asian girl and tell her to come dance with us.  She immediately busts out into hip hop and I'm blown away.  This HB8 just became an HB9 We start chatting about both going to the same college graduating at the same time and living in the same international house.  She even knows my girlfriend.  I pull her over to a booth to continue talking and I say, she is so cool I need to kiss her.  She doesn't seem at all like the type of person to do this and is really shy. I make a bet about my name which nobody really knows cause I don't go by it and I say if I win (which I always do cause its my mother fucking name, take a game theory class!) She gives me a real kiss and if I loose I buy her a drink, only to find out that she Isn't drinking either.  My Boner is now Raging for this girl. I show her my ID and and she says that it is a cool name. I pull her in and we start making out. just as the kiss is climaxing I pull away.  I go back in and when she is expecting the kiss I bump noses in an Eskimo kiss.  Now she is raging for me and I say i have to leave.  She wants to exchange numbers.  I Groan, saying I hate calling its so much work, and she says she will make it worth my while. I ask her what that means and she says she will give me what I want. And I ask her what she thinks I want. She says what all guys want, to be physical.  I say \"girl, getting physical is just the cherry on top of a delicious milkshake.  If you don't have the milkshake then all you are left with is a disgusting maraschino cherry.  We have so much in common, I can tell you are at least vanilla, but are you a delectable chocolate milkshake?\"  (bitches love chocolate)  she was creaming her pants as I was leaving. I'm texting her tomorrow and sleeping with her on Sunday, otherwise you should just cut off my balls cause I don't deserve them.\n\nSo while I sit here concluding another round of sets, I look back at how far I have come in 3 months sober gaming a few times a week, and I realized that non of this would have been possible if I didn't choose to do it sober.  The old saying goes, you only get out what you put in, and by leaving my comfort zone every day by talking to women without aid of a substance I gain so much, and what I gain, I keep, and can always use.

We talk a bit about school and I transition into how I want to get my bartender's license and do something \"unconventional\" kinda like her (she was a bartender too at one point). She gave me some great tips on where to bartend and what not. She tells me she'll see me around and tells me it was a pleasure meeting me. I say the same and we part ways. \n\n**50/** I see this girl in front of the arts building sitting on a bench. I do a U-turn, go up to her while she's texting on her phone. I go direct on her. And the funniest thing happens. Turns out I approached this girl before because she tells me, \"You said this to me already.\" I don't even hesitate. I say,\"Well you look so gorgeous I had to come and tell you that a second time. The first time didn't even do you justice.\" She gives me an awkward laugh and continues to text. \"Well have a good one,\" I say, and she says the same. I walk away laughing. \n\n**51/**HB 8.5 Colombian girl - I have to say, this girl was one of THE hottest girls I've seen on campus, hands down. I see her from a distance, let her pass me by, wait for about 5 seconds, do a U-turn, tap her lightly on her left arm and go with my direct opener. She is super receptive. This is when I realized I've seen her at our physical activities complex cuz she works there. I comment on her nose piercing which is really distinct (it's a black ring piercing) and she laughs. I ask her where she's going and she says she's going to \"see somebody\". I just tease her about that:\"Ooo 'see somebody' eh? I wonder who this is ;P' and she proceeds to tell me that she's kinda dating this guy but he's off to France soon. I then transition the conversation about my travel experiences in Costa Rica once she tells me she's Colombian. She's really impressed. She talked about the Latin American students association in my school which I honestly never knew about. I tell her that I'll see her around and wished her all the best with her man.

{"body":"1 and 2:\n\nI went to my cousins wedding recently and made more than small talk with two different women. Given that we were at the same wedding finding a reason to walk up and talk to either of them wasn't difficult.\n\n1. The first girl sat at the same table as me. When everyone went to get drinks we stayed and talked about interesting bullshit: math, the stock market, and robots. I fucking love that shit and she did too so I thought we hit it off on a brain level. At some point in the conversation she mentioned she had a boy friend so I just kind of disinvested and bailed. If it was a weird game / test thing I wasn't interested in playing it and if she did then I'm not going to bust my hump to fuck some poor bastard over.\n\n2. My mom (yeah I go to weddings with my mom, you don't?) dragged some poor girl over to meet me. She was average looking but had sweet travel stories. Also girl could dance her damn face off. It was a lot of fun but I didn't really establish myself as a potential mate, mostly by being awkward given that my mom set me up # rookiebullshitonmypart.\n\nThe takeaway from these interactions for me is that I need to break out of Tom Brokaw mode. I have a tendency to force conversation into continuing by asking barrages of shitty questions. Thats something to work on. Also I dont establish a frame (frame?) of this is an interaction with a potential mate. Whatever, no place to go but up.","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

I was already sleeping yesterday and was at a poolparty today. It has been a cool couple of awesome but tiring days. I've had a good time with you, too bad i didn't see you again, you're a good kisser.

Changed clothes there because i've been sweating all day long and wanted to take a shower but the water was shut off because there was a problem in my appartment. So i just put on a gym tang top instead of a t-shirt. I thought i didnt look to bad for not having taken a shower that day, probably smelled a bit too but i put on some deodorant. Make my way onto the train, I look for a place to sit, I see this girl sitting on a bench and sit right in front of her ( I've been doing Nofap for 15 days now so I had 0 anxiety to approach) I open by asking a pen to fill in my train ticket, HB 6.5 I think. Then i pull out my Game of thrones book and start reading, I make a comment about that it's too hot to read so I put my book aside and give her my full attention. Started kino then and there, putting my leg against her, and sticking out my hand what her name was. She looked at my hand funny but i didnt move an inch. I put on a big smile and she smiles back and she tells me her name. Being alpha as fuck here and after a while i put out my phone and said here put in your details and we'll do something in Ghent if I have some time. She was melting right then and there I think haha. We arrived at the same station, saw my twin brother standing at the parking lot to pick me up, put my hand on her upperarm and gave her a kiss on the cheeck.

{"body":"Alas comes a new day.  After going to bed at 5 am last night, I awake sleepily to my snoozed alarm at 9:30.  I have a day two to attend too. I arrive at 11 and go see a conservatory, go on a hike, climb to the top of a viewing tower and take a row boat out on a lake to french music playing from my Pandora as we picnic on the water.  Needless to say the date ends well back at her place, and the whole day only cost 20 bucks.  Boo Ya, I had a great time!  The last 3 nights have been getting increasingly epic, the desire to end the weekend on a high note coupled with my incredibly satiating date and long amazing day really made me feel like staying in.  So I pulled off to the side of the road before hitting up the freeway entrance out of the city, and I think.  I am here I am ready and I don't feel like going out, that is lame!  So I text around to some ladies I met to see if a quick meetup can be arranged, might as well as I would never call them otherwise.  I also text a couple of my friends, one is staying in, one is going to 90's night at an awesome club in town with friends, cha-ching!  I say I'll meet him there, so I head over.  I arrive just as the doors are opening, and the place is really empty. But I see two guys and two girls, and the set begins...\n\n**Set 42:**  two guys are dancing with two Indian chicks an HB7 and an HB5, I am not really feeling it, but what do I have to loose.  I chit chat with them about the night club we are at, and they inform me that it is free drinks until 10.  This means nothing to me and I tell them I am not drinking, but I will head over and see if they will get me a club soda for free, which is  usually not the case with these vodka company sponsored promotions.  Free vodka cranberry. Cranberry Juice 4 dollars. bull shit.  I realize that the 80's club attire allows for white shoes so I go out to change, but while I am at my car the group I opened walks buy. I ask where they are going and they are bouncing to another part of town and I offer them a ride.  They tell me I am to smashed to be driving to which I bust out a back flip and stick perfectly.  They agree I am now sober, and crazy but the one Indian girl just broke up with her ex who is now at the club and she got drunk and needs to walk it off, but they invite me to come along for the company to which I agree.  As we are walking we soon realize that the other part of town is a couple miles away so we stop off at a random live music cafe with a sign that says children welcome.  I inform the sober HB7 that it means she is allowed in. She punches me in the arm and we all sit down for drinks.  The HB5 is super drunk and all over me, which is surprisingly good at cock blocking my attempts to escalate the sober HB7.  My friend arrived at the club 10 minutes ago and is blowing up my phone, so I tell them I needed to go.\n\n**Set 43:**My friend bounced from the club but said he was going across the bridge to a going away house party, and invites me along. I say I'm down, and his friend picks me up outside my car.  I bring the Booze I have sitting in my trunk, its about time I get rid of the stuff, cause I'm not drinking and it will be good to bring something as I am more closely connected to Kevin Bacon than the chick throwing the party. I get crammed in the back seat between two girls and told that we have to be gentlemen at the party and not to hit on the chicks there.  I said that's no problem, and that I'll just hit on the chicks here instead.  The ladies laugh. I tell them that they should tell people at the party that I am gay, and whip out my sassy gay act which puts them all into a fit of laughter. I kino the girls while I do this and they eat it up.  Oh and they are an HB4 and an HB9.  The HB9 Is taken but we dance and grind and talk about sex for the rest of the night.  We are literally the same people inn different bodies and she asks me out to hike with her, hand with her dog and do yoga with her. She even winged me  for set 44. On the drive back she asked for my phone number and we exchanged, #-close which was amazing because of what I will describe in the next set.\n\n**Set 44:**  We get the party and I immediately start chatting with the host, a fun HB2 who shares a few interests, I talk and dance and fit in, then While I'm talking to set 43 HB9  Set 44 HB8 come up and starts in on the conversation.  HB9 gets up and I pick up HB8 and sit her next to me, HB9 comes back to HB8s spot, and the conversation continues. When HB9 gets momentarily distracted I lean into HB8's mouth and sniff it.  I ask her if she smokes, she says socially, and I ask to taste, going in for the kiss.  We kiss for a little and she asks me if I smoke to which I reply, I don't, but I like living vicariously through interesting peoples, to which I continue to make out with her.  We go Into the kitchen to poor shots and I fill both our shot glasses with water and tell her she is my sober buddy.  A few minutes later she goes upstairs with the HB9 and we are all sitting and chatting while I am escalating further with the HB8.  People leave the room, except for the HB9 who says she is staying to make sure we have sex.  I realize now that she probably wanted to get in on a 3 some, a subtle Observation that I would never have made while drinking. But In the moment, I was focused and I left with both of them, but pulled the HB8 back after we had all left and thrust her on the bed, pressing myself up against her.  She gave her token resistance which I ignored and we both ended up going down on each other.  I tried to escalate to sex, but she told me her criteria for sleeping with a guy is that he needs to be able to pronounce her name.  I tell her she must not sleep with many guys, to which she she gives me the next best thing.  We head down stairs and the news had gotten around.  Hi Fives all around, then I turn to her and grab her number, and the phonetic spelling of her name.\n\nAny day where you score two women is a good day.  Next time I will try to escalate the 3 some opportunity as I think I am beginning to recognize what it looks like :}\n\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

{"body":"Set 0.5 \u2013 While waiting for a prescription to finish, I wandered around WalMart.  Didn\u2019t approach anyone with intent, but I did have a very brief conversation with a attractive girl to see if she was alright.  She had bruises on her cheeks and looked nervous and sad.  She said she was fine.  I hope so.  That\u2019s a brutal topic to start off with.\n\nSet 1 \u2013 Sat at Starbucks and read a bit.  Noticed an HB4 giving me the correct body language.  Caught her looking at me, then looking away when I looked back.  I was aiming to approach a couple more attractive ladies, but didn\u2019t seize the moment.  Said girl was very shy.  Wanting, but really shy.  Lot of spaces in between the conversation.  I watched some of that Hold a Conversation like A Man video and kept silent to get her to continue to talk.  She did a little, but not much.  I contend that I should have done more of the talking, as she seemed to respond at least neutrally to my talking.  As I left, she went asked for my name and shook my hand.\n\nSet 1.5 \u2013 Went to the mall and after doing nothing for the longest time, I passingly opened a jewelry counter attendant.  As she responded in a \u201cI\u2019m at work.  That\u2019s why I am so pleasant\u201d kind of way, I turned around and engaged her.  Talked for a couple minutes, but she kept looking around.  So I left it at that.  \n\nSet 2 \u2013 I don\u2019t even know what this means.  Sat in Starbucks #2 (I wanted to get more sets in) and saw this girl sitting by herself outside.  Approached her, she smiled and said I could sit.  After some awkward looks, I started a convo.  Kept eye contact about 95% of the conversation.  She just had the biggest smile I ever saw.  However, she never continued the conversation.  There were soooo many long pauses; I filled them in a bunch of time with sort of interview questions, trying to get in to more deep conversations (Why instead of what/how).  Finally just sat there, kept great eye contact, and waited for her to start something.  I got a pleasantly said, anxiety ridden \u201cwhat\u201d.  She eventually asked me to leave so she could have her \u201calone time\u201d.  So I left.  As I left the Starbucks I stopped by again and said have a nice evening.

{"body":"Last weekend I went out to a trendy night club with a few friends, and i decided to bring a wing along.  I bring this crazy christian girl I have been hanging, and while she is interested in me, I friend zoned her.  As we step into the night club I meet up with my friends talk to them, hang out with my wing then I notice the set.\n\n**Set 31:** I walk up to them with my wing and tell them about the bet that we had that my wing could not remember all of their names, which she did easily even after returning 10 minutes later.  This was awesome, because I am notoriously bad with names.  I quickly wrote them down.  later on in the evening I saw them at the bar near the dance floor, and dragged them all out.  The HB9 with the D cup boobs was dancing like crazy, and I should have joined her, but instead did the safe thing and dance with the HB7 we got into it, and i spun her around and started making out with her.  I bounced to find my wing but returned for her number at the end of the night.  The group enjoyed me, and I hope to bring them out again in the future.\n\n**Set 32:** Two Cute Asian Girls, small, but both wearing a skirt and bra, and one was a smoking HB9.  I went up to them to ask the HB9 if her bra was made of organically grown cotton with natural colors, and went on to explain how cotton naturally comes in 6 colors and by using them you avoid dyes that are harmful for the environment.  She ate it up and at the end of the night we exchanged phone numbers.  Approaching hot sets is much easier with a cute wing woman...  The powers of social proof!.\n\n**READ!**So as you can tell, *the Epiphany* is Upon Me!!! I have learned the secret to making out with girls, and for me it has never been much of a problem sleeping with girls I kiss, the problem is I almost never get to this stage when I am sober, and when I'm drunk enough to do it, I am way out of the mood hyper, or too drunk to actually have sex!  I have found the **Answer:** escalate, easier done than thought about.  You are a fun and interesting guy, if you stop thinking about saying stuff and just say it, we all are.  And if you are fun and interesting and you begin to touch them punch them in the arm, hug them at moments and move them around, they will follow cause they like you, and you are interesting!  And once you two are aloneish, and you say I want to kiss you she will, and if she doesn't you just say with a confident smile, that it will be awkward now if you don't kiss, she will. and once you kiss your number is solid, and if you have logistics worked out you just keep kissing until it is comfortable, almost like nothing to you guys anymore, and you step it by bringing her back, or to an empty booth or to the back of your car, or to the bathroom. **THAT IS THE SECRET** JUST KEEP ESCALATING UNTIL YOU KISS HER. 50% of the time now I am kissing a woman I can hold a comfortable conversation with, the conversation is harder than the kiss and it seems I am only not getting kisses when they have boyfriends or husbands. as long as you can hold an awesome conversation and escalating.  Then 50% of the time those girls want to immediately bounce for sex, and the other 50% I cut the interaction with before it even is put on the table, which is probably eminent unless you crazy blow it.  In just the last 2 nights of going out I have been offered sex from 4 women, all I had to do was drive us back to their place and fuck them that's 4 fucking chicks in 2 days, but you will find out soon enough as we continue onto...\n\n**Set 33:** So I go on a grouper with 2 of my friends and the girls are mediocre to be sure, but once it ends we all meet up with our larger group of friends at a local dive bar that is popping!  I see one of my friends talking to an Asian HB6 a Guatemalan HB7 and their blonde dude friend.  I go up and say hi to him to try and give him a little social proof, and he whispers that he wants me to wing him by taking care of the Asian girl and the friend.  They are both interesting people so I talk to all of them for a couple minutes then  focus on the Asian and the dude.  We Chit Chat and dance while my friend gets one on one conversation with his girl, and I wait for the blonde dude to catch the train back home. I offer him a ride to the station telling him I am sober, which by the way is *always* a massive turn on for girls. To 3X as much fun as drunk people while not drinking a drop makes you Mr Incredible in their eyes, and for good reason, Its hard, it takes you out of your comfort zone, but you gain soooooo much from it.  He doesn't need the ride and bounces.  We dance a bit more with them then propose getting burritos, cause we know a bomb ass spot that isn't too far.  We escort them back to the car with one of our drunk friends who is making a bit of a scene, but we are all cool people who don't give a fuck at this point, so while they are starting to get nervous we tell them that he gets turrets when he is drunk and we make funny impressions of him, which actually helped the situation a lot rather than being detriment to it.  If you can make a woman feel safe around you, you are getting bonus points.  We get burritos and on the car ride back I grab the HB6 who is now an HB7.5 after talking to her then, I put my arm around her and say \"there is something incredibly sexy about your Spock haircut, I need to kiss you\" the go in for it, a peck on the cheek turns into making out. We drop the girls off, and a day two is solid!\n\n**Set 34:** The next day, class is running a little later than expected, and I get to the city a bit late.  I pick up my friend outside a venue that just started having a cover and we head over to the bar area.  I am feeling really not in the mood to approach people as I woke up at 6 am after going to bed at 3 and sitting in front of a computer all day then going to class.  But no rest for the wicked and tonight was going to be baaad!  After chatting with a few random people and having really good conversations I was feeling a little bit better, but none of the girls in the bar we were at were at my level, either not attractive enough, or in a situation that felt insurmountable at the moment.  I took the chicken way out and went outside to just chill.  There I met a girl alone sitting against the wall this cute HB6 was rather interesting and her nickname was Rat because growing up she looked like master splinter.  I chatted with her and she was ending her night to take care of her drunk friend.  I made conversation hugged her a couple times at high moments and when her drunk friend came out who had just gotten out of a relationship, it was time to go.  Her buzzed friend was in super party mode and didn't want to leave, but Rat was very persuasive and said since I could give a ride they wouldn't have to wait around for the bus.  I went in and grabbed my buddy.  We walked outside and i put my arm around Rat and we walled back to the car shooting the shit.  We get to my car and my friend is already making out with her friend, and I say jokingly to rat that I forgot about the toll, one kiss.  I pull her in and we kiss, then make out, then our two friends crawl in the cozy back seat eating each others faces while I get into the front and start withholding kisses.  As we are driving back to their place my wing is getting an over the pants hand job while I'm chatting to rat when we arrive, Rat asks me to come in, but my wing is fully satisfied and frankly I'm not into white girls, so I need to get back to the hunt. I put my number into her phone as the Sottaly Tober ghuy and we head out!\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

{"body":"Got a couple more sets in, including ones in a club. Clubs are basically foreign territory to me, but I want to get the hang of club game (even though it's probably never going to be a strong venue for me).\n\n**8 - 9:** Approached a few sets on the street. Simple approach, quick chat, nothing noteworthy.\n\n**10 - 16:** I tried physical opens in the club, almost every opportunity I got. Usually goes like this: I point at her or catch her eye and then hold out one or both of my hands in a \"come dance with me\" type of gesture. Depending on the situation, I might also step in closer and verbally tell her to come dance with me.\n\nI didn't get any of the girls to dance with me, unfortunately. There must be something I'm doing wrong, in my body language. I find it hard to imagine that 0 out of 6 girls have any interest in dancing with someone at a club (unless I really don't understand this club thing at all, which is also possible).\n\n**17:** Best set was earlier in the night, at a bar. I spotted a girl that was just stunning. And exactly my type of stunning, too.\n\nShe was sitting at a table with two guys. I wanted to approach and then caught myself starting to over-analyze. Which side should I approach from? Will I have to move that chair? Stuff like that. I was basically just stalling, so I shut my inner voice by standing up and walking towards the table. I held out my hands towards her: \"can I borrow you for two seconds?\"\n\nI got some WTF looks from the guys (and her), but I just held it. Told the guys it would just be for two seconds and repeated my invitation to her.\n\nShe got up and we took a few steps from the table.\n\nNote: the reason I wanted her to stand up is because I find it awkward to talk to someone who's seated while I'm standing. With both of us standing, it's much better.\n\nI told her that she'd caught my eye and that I thought she was gorgeous and just wanted to let her know that. She took the compliment well. I asked if one of the guys was her boyfriend and she confirmed. Told her he was a lucky guy and after a few short moments of chit-chat, went on my way.\n\nThis was the best set of the night. She was taken, but she responded positively and I think I lit up her day a little bit. Plus, I overcame the problem of not approaching when there are too many obstacles.\n\n*****\n\nI definitely have a LOT of work to do, concerning club game.

{"body":"\"But i feel like sometimes i come off as annoying\"\n\nI believe this emotion is artificial and comes from the mind. You feel good inside, do you not? The only reason not to feel good is because you're mind is gauging their response and putting a label on it. Learn to lose those thoughts completely. I'm still working on it.

He is an expert in social dynamics and he said if he could recommend one thing that would show substantial gains, it's to \"Be present in the moment\", Which is to say, you wouldn't know whether or not you came off as annoying, because you didn't let your mind visit the past or the future to determine that. Sometimes that can sound silly, because it only seems natural to analyze your progress. But at the end of the day, it doesn't matter what that person thought of you.

Great conversation! \n\n**46/** HB 8.5 Redhead asian. I approach directly. She's kinda creeped out, smiles and says, \"Thank you.\" She just starts walking away. I bid her adieu. \n\n**47/** HB 7 Tall cute blond. I go direct after a gentle tap on her arm from the back. She's really receptive as well. I do some basic cold reads. I tell her that she doesn't seem like the typical city girl and she seems more like the small town, country kinda girl. She's surprised that my guess was so accurate. We talked a bit more about school. I was nonchalant, didn't go for the digits, only wanted to stack topics at this point.","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

{"body":"I went out this last weekend to the Oakland art murmur, a monthly gallery walk/party.  It was an environment I felt comfortable in, so I was actually able to make a bunch of approaches this night, more than I have in one outing ever before!  No real results, but I'm still very happy with how many openings I did.  Once I got started, it was easy!  I can remember 6 approaches I did, but I'm actually pretty sure I did more.  Here they are:\n\n22)  A cute Indian HB5 by the food trucks.  I said hi to her, talked about the event, then asked who she was there with.  She mentioned her bf, so I ejected.\n\n23)  HB8 by the window of one of the galleries looking out onto the street.  I asked if there was good people watching out the window.  She seemed a bit taken aback, but talked to me for a few minutes.  I talked about the art in the gallery, and she seemed into it.  She asked me for my name, but when I asked who she was there with, she introduced me to her bf.  Oh well.\n\n24)  HB9.  Was checking out some art that had some texture to it.  I opened with \"I just wanna touch it, don't you?\"  Got her to laugh and smile.  She agreed with me, but ejected quickly and went back to her friends.\n\n25)  Tried a direct approach to one of the staff memebers at the event.  She was standing by one of the exhibits.  Opened with \"Don't take this the wrong way, but those tattoos are fucking hot!\"  I was a little bit drunk at this point and may have stumbled over the line.  She thanked me and smiled, but I didn't know what to say after, so nothing happened.\n\n26)  Started another convo with an HB7 who is checking out the art (art shows make for great situational openers).  Again, 2 minutes of conversation about the art before I run out of things to say.  This is starting to look like a sticking point for you.  Something to think about working on as I move forward.\n\n27)  Opened a girl with \"I wish they would put the medium near the artwork so I know what type it is...\"  Again, ran out of conversation fairly quickly.\n\nSo that's it.  27 official approaches so far.  This last FR was from about a week ago, and I haven't made any real approaches since then (although I still practice my conversation skills with existing friends.)  Tomorrow I leave on a trip out of town to visit my sister, and I'm hoping that being in a new city will give me motivation to do even more approaches.

{"body":"I see that it has been 2 months since I've last posted here; first of all I'd like to change the purpose of my semi-blog semi-100 set.\n\nIf I have to put a number on it i would say that I'm at number 30-31 probably a lot has happened, I just developed this amazing life-style that really **suits my personality**, which I think **everyone** should try to aim for. I like to travel so what do I do? --&gt; i travel I like meeting new people so what do I do? ----&gt; I meet new people. \n\nSo like I said earlier I'm changing the goal of this so *it will become my full time pick-up blog* I'll try my best to keep up track with the numbers but can't promise anything. \n\nWhat have I been up to the last couple of 2 months since I last posted you might ask, good question!\n\nSo first of all I finished my university exams and on my way to my third year right now. I thought about updating once in a while for a new number but then thought that the numbers don't really matter. Last month alone I have 5 girls that I've made out with not to mention the numbers that I've collected and am pursuing right now. I've been slapped and hit at by a girl because i was touching her boobs in the first 2 minutes of talking to her and then successfully making out with her and ended up getting a BJ from her. Each situation is different in pick-up the playing field always changes, I think what I've learned the most is which situations to proceed in and which are just hopeless. Sometimes you're at a bar with 2 friends sometimes you're just walking some place and see a cute girl. This is the main reason that I'm not going to put up the numbers. You would never be able to capture all the variables that are in play by let's say 5 sentences. My goal in writing this, is passing up my knowledge to guys that have the willingness to learn and go out there and have fun.\n\nPick-up is much more than just making out/banging women. Girls want to be taken on an adventure and you have to take them and let them enjoy the ride. **Every girl needs a prince on a white horse**. Be that guy and start **TODAY**. But weedbrownies *how do I do this?* **Good question**\n\nI'm not going to elaborate to much because there is much more detailed material available for you guys but this is my opinion.\n\n**BE THE PERSON YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO BE**\n\nNot only will you improve your lifestyle and general happiness you will also attract a lot more girls who are in your demographic. If you don't know what you want or what your interests are (BE HONEST WITH YOURSELF ABOUT THIS, i didn't figure it out till 3 months ago) take a week to seriously think about it, preferably in solitary. Ask friends for advice if needed don't be afraid to ask. They don't have a clue either about life, they'll understand.\n\n**START WORKING ON YOURSELF**\n\nSeriously thinking if you are at the right place in time will get you much further then assuming you've made the right decision. It is also the best way to spent your time, if you work on yourself e.g. learning a language, it will help you one way or the other in pick-up. *Everything is related in life* If you are interested in for example learning french and make an active effort in learning it, opportunities will rise up if you want it or not that other people do not get. It has gotten me into Paris where I made a lot of new friends and one in particular (thomas I know you're reading this, yes i mean you). Not friendwise did it help me but I also managed to pick up women in french cuz of it. Because they realize what a tremendous effort you did into learning it, they will instantly like you even more.\n\n**JUST SAY HI**\n\nDon't have expectations of what will come further, if it's meant to be it will all come clear within the first 3 interactions. State your intentions clearly and you will never get friendzoned. I do this at the start of every interaction with a girl I have (1on1). Not only is it more clear for her but it makes you waste less time on a girl as well.\n\n**DONT BE AFRAID TO GET REJECTED**\n\nIt's not that bad actually, i have a rate of 85% that i can convey I think, but i just solely focus on my demographic and women with the same interests as me. If she's really bitchy about the fact that you tried to pick her up, tell her that at least you had the balls to do that, *you can always be disliked but you should never be misunderstood for who you are and what you stand for*. Tell her she's the bitch if she shoots you down too hard. You had to scrape all your courage together to go talk to her and do your thing. You are a man and you have values and boundaries. **NOBODY** should feel bad for trying to express themselfs. Just try and evaluate the situation if it went bad and try to learn from it. \n\nI have a lot more to say but I'm tired at the moment so I'll be going to sleep now. Will come back to post some more material later and it would be awesome if you guys have some questions i'll be more then happy to ask them. Last but not least I started to teach 2 friends what i know and we've been having a blast doing it. They are making progress.\n\nLast but not least; **the key to successfully picking up women is having fun!** + as always bro's before ho's!

{"body":"Set 29 \u2013 I went to the convention wrap up meeting.  There was this girl I opened there that I thought was too young.  She was laying it on pretty thick.  Then on the last day, as I was leaving, I noticed she had a pack of cigarettes blatantly showing in her pocket.  At that point I was too tired, so I said fuck it at the time.  She\u2019s at the wrap up party, still keeping up the same report.  I stole her chair, she set in my lap.  Forgot her name (cringe).  Not too long after that, I decided that I didn\u2019t have enough information to pursue this.  Picked her up by the waist and sat her in a chair next to me.  Better safe than sorry.  \n\nSet 30 \u2013 As I was leaving the meeting, I saw a lady at the hotel bar.  I know the 3-second life hack, but I seem to find I don\u2019t have 3 seconds to spare.  It\u2019s gone that fast.  So I go and chat outside the hotel, not worrying about it.  I go back in to hit her up, but two guys who were at the meeting told me to leave (hotel rules).  I say I just want to use the restroom (true) and they say go this other direction.  When you doing things right, things pan out because she is now playing arcade games in the same wing as this other restroom.  Fate.  We play an arcade game and chat about her recent adventure and passions.  Turns out she\u2019s married and on her honeymoon.  The best part was the guy who was talking to her at the bar walks in.  I address him, \u201cAre you the husband she recently acquired?\u201d  She turns to me and says no and in that time, he has bolted.  (Self amused chuckle)  The game ended and she was going to go swimming.  I didn\u2019t have a suit and haven\u2019t been so rock solid on my diet, so I said have a good night.  Always have be in your a-game and be prepared.  \n\nSet 31 \u2013 Was at a bar where my DJ friend was at.  Talking and interacting with him built some decent rapport.  After a couple crappy opens with people at the bar, dancing seemed like a great idea as I drank free alcohol.  A couple of girls were standing by the table and I went bold.  I remember doing that, but not what I said.  They didn\u2019t take it well, but conversation didn\u2019t seem ruined.  I did not convey enough sarcasm/troll face I guess. Not important.  Went even bolder (and what was still too much) later with the way douchey line of, \u201cYou guys just come in to tease guys, don\u2019t you?\u201d  Way too much.  I felt like shit.  So I left.  Shouldn\u2019t do that again.\n\nSet 32 \u2013 I don\u2019t remember, but I locked eyes with some girl who looked like she had had a rough life and was enjoying it.  She played along and grinded.  Then she wrapped her legs around me and I essentially violently dry fucked her standing up (Putting that time working out to use).  When it ended, I did not feel she was attracted to me.  I felt that pretty strongly.  That she was there for the same reason I was, doing crazy shit.  I can\u2019t break down body language well yet, but that seemed overwhelmingly the answer.  So against the wishes of this guy who demanded I get back in there, I went back to drinking.  Granted I forgot to give eye contact that entire time.  Dumb.\n\nSet 33 \u2013 Went doubles with a girl at pool.  I remember catching her off guard many times, but no real conversation was made.  She and her friend were practically being mauled by guys.  Guys with a bunch more experience than I.  She was kept positive the whole time, but I bailed with my friend that night; however, I didn\u2019t leave before continuing rapport with the guys there. (They were regulars I\u2019ve met before and I will be back)\n\nSet 34 \u2013 Went to a bar with friends and was basically just enjoying the night.  I have not been out to a bar with more than one friend (which was a rare occasion anyway) maybe ever.  One of the guys mentions he liked one of the girls at the bar, but he acted like he had AA.  So I go and walk up to her to chat her up.  No one did anything that night, and I\u2019ll be damned if I don\u2019t open anyone that night.  That\u2019s dumb.  She ended up being about 40+ and was being hit on by the bartender.  I have yet to be told \u201cI have a boyfriend,\u201d as a way to scare me off.  I was told that by the BARTENDER.  I just accepted it.  I wasn\u2019t there to hit on her, just to prove a point to my AA friend.  I should have realized it, but once again, one drink past too drunk.  I\u2019m still counting 34-0 on use of boyfriend shit test.  \n\nSet 35 \u2013 I\u2019ve got two free tickets to a water park with the last day to use them are this weekend.  I want to use them for a date.  If not, I\u2019m debating whether to go alone.  I\u2019m thinking that be a bit much as I don\u2019t look the best after slacking a bit on my diet.  So that of course means I have to go.  I was at Wal-Mart for groceries and opened the check-out girl.  She was wildly receptive and seemed like she wanted me to ask her out/number.  I just asked for change.  Beat myself up a little.  BUT a few days later, I was shopping there again and she was there.  Reopened and took care of business.  First 100 Sets # close.\n\nSet 36 \u2013 And more errands.  Connected with a girl in the checkout line.  She eats healthy and so do I (now) meaning I was able to hold conversation.  Despite the fact that I had a bunch of distance, mentioning that I recently made ratatouille (It\u2019s delicious and putting those newly pursued passions to work) I think finished it.

Got to the point of being uncomfortable and she apparently did not have her social norms filter on. She checks out and leaves, finally.\n\nI get done at that store but they didn't have one of the things I was looking for so I head down to the megastore. I'm checking my phone and from the side I hear some comment about shopping at this store too. Look up and see it's the same lady. I make a brusque reply that I don't even remember to try to blow her off and get back on my phone. She kinda looks around kinda lost then walks off. I try to avoid her in the store for the rest of my trip. Made the mistake of going to the self-checkout and notice at the last second that she's there too. I could have turned back but just plowed on through. I checked out quickly then took off for the door. Looked over my shoulder on the way out to make sure she didn't see me get into my car. Paranoid? Yeah, but I'd rather just not have to deal.\n\nSo I have no idea what her deal was. if she's just a crazy cat lady who is looking to talk to anyone. Or if she's trying to hit on me. Or whatever. The key point is that I don't want to be \"that guy\" (or that lady in this case). I have enough issues with AA that being afraid of coming off as creepy is one issue I don't need to complicate things. But on the upside, I can recognize when social norms are broken and can eject before it gets to the point of being weird.","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

It's scary.\" I was just like \"YOLO!\" and sidled up next to her and started chatting. Talked about the beautiful weather out today, how it reminded me of home. Conversation started and flowed smoothly. Walked her to the bank, asked her if she wanted to grab coffee. She said she had a boyfriend, but was she told me how impressed she was with me just walking up to her and starting to chat. She thought it was great and wished more guys did that. I was beaming after she said that. This encounter alone made my day. SUCCESS!!!\n\n**14:** Girl on bus. Got chatting about weather and summers in this city.

{"body":"So back track a couple of days to the Thursday smack dab in between my last post, there is something I need to take care of.  Even though I forgot about it round one, it was a game changer.\n\n**Set 26:** Hot HB8 at a dance bar in one of the cuttier parts of town.  An HB8 with a nice scarf walks around and I open her with the infinity scarf line, which I vomit amazement to every time it works, which is all the time.  We chat and I get her phone number to go climbing. We text for a bit, but I fuck it up with one of my texts and it is over, shattered like a pane of glass.\n\n**Set 27:** We stuff 6 of us guys into my car and drive over to the hipster part of town where my friend opens a tall HB9 with an Abercrombie boy friend, but he was cool and had tight game so we were forced to bounce to the bars by the park.  I meet this group of lesbian girls and their one friend, who I chat with briefly as I am leaving to drive my friend to the train.  We make eye contact while getting increasingly closet to her, and we kino each other on the arms.  I know things are going to be solid for my return.  When I get back I play pool and when her friends clear out, and I have her alone, I can see the look in her eyes that I cant really describe but this is the game changer. I go for the kiss reacting to this eye beg then tease her for cigarette breath. She gets really self conscious, so I kiss her again and tell her \"the ashtray is gone, now it just tastes like good beer.\" We head outside and chat a little longer, and as I make my departure, she asks me to stay, and when I said I have to get back home, she says \" you could leave in the morning\" to which I reply \"are you asking me to come home with you\" to which she responded \"yes\".  I'm not into white chicks and I am still a little bitch, but that is the closest I have come to a single night lay since sobriety has started, and man was it a game changer, especially finally comprehending the look.\n\n**Set 28:** With Hook Shot in hand (knowing the kiss look) and the blue tunic on (moving my body when dancing) I head to the water temple (Motown Mondays!!!) I run into my friends at the front of the line and make conversation with the guy behind them, which saves me about an hour of waiting in line. FUCK YEA.  When I finally get into the club everybody is dancing, which is way out of my comfort zone.  I meet up with my friends to try to juice up, then head to the bar to approach some stagnant women, which is moderately successful but I reach a point in every conversation where the woman looks at me in a way that screams: 'When the fuck are you going to ask me to dance!?'  After blowing out of 3 sets I grab my alcohol free drink one of the sets bought me and chill out on a booth to gather my wits. (BTW DD's are in greater demand than women, I get free drinks from 50% of bartenders and 10% of sets. FYI) Then I see a balloon, no idea where it came from, but tied it to my arm and got the courage to go up and dance.  As soon as I did this, all the ladies who blew me out wanted to dance and wanted to talk! I left the dance floor to put down my sweater when a girl popped my balloon.  The set I was talking to all jumped, but I maintained perfect composure and saw all of their attraction increase.  I then turned to the girl and said it was my birthday to which she felt really bad, so I pulled her close and said don't feel bad, it's not really my birthday, now give me a kiss.  She says her boyfriend is around and he will see, to which I stared deeply in her eyes and said, we better be quick before he gets back. We kiss passionately for a moment, then I push her away and get back to talking to the girls I opened before and number closed one of them for Hot chocolate (I love you hot chocolate).\n\n**Set 29:** I get sweaty from dancing and need a break, so I head over to the massage therapist who is charging a dollar a minute. I lean over to her and say, you are very lovely, and I would love to get to know you better! Unfortunately, you have to work, and I have to dance, so how about we get some hot chocolate together next week? Bam! number close, one line, The only thing she said to me all night was \"OK\",\n\n**Set 30:**  These two Asian girls come in, an HB4 and an HB7, I immediately start talking to them, I tell them to pound their drinks, and I lead them out to the dance floor.  We start dancing and grinding, and I kiss the HB4 on the cheek, and boy she wasn't having it (no wonder she is fat, I feel they sometime are just too scared of sexual interaction, they stay fat as protection... daddy issues) but whatever, she was LOVING IT, they bother were!.  This big black guy comes up and starts chatting with the HB7 and I totally shoot him down by over sexualizing him which of course he will fail the shit test to, because he is loving the black, you never go back, and big penis references.  This made everybody have a good time, while making him not a valid mate. If there is one thing I have learned is that talking about it is a step back, doing it is a step forward.  I left and returned 4 times, and I got their numbers halfway through the evening, passing their shit tests along the way.  As i was bouncing to go home, I kissed the HB4 on the Cheek, then the HB7, who then kissed my cheek back.  I then went in for the kiss and exchanged a wet kiss on the lips.  I texted back this morning telling her how that kiss stole my heart, and she replied, come to Virginia with me to get it back ;)\n\nLast night was my most successful night out yet I feel. A day two with a smoking hot girl, a bunch of Solid Day 2 options one a nearly sure fire F-close D2, and few K-closed to keep my immune system sharp. in the immortal words of Ice Cube: \"I didn't even have to use my AK, today was a good day.\"","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

I just could not talk myself into it.  Finally, after she walked by, I told her to come over to me.  I said, \"You're beautiful, and I would have regretted not telling you that.\" It was a little fumbled though, as I'm still scared to tell women how I feel at times.  She blushed and stayed to talk.  We chatted a bit, and then I said I wanted to take her out.  I asked if she was taken (first mistake), and she said she sort of was.  I just said, \"Okay, nice meeting you, HB8. (second mistake).\"  I should have escalated and called her out on only being sort of taken and not being too sure.  I should have kept going.  I probably could have gotten the date.\n\nThe plus side was that one of my friends saw the whole thing and was impressed.  I got to tell him it's the only way you're going to find a good girl.

But alas comes Thursday night, and and one of the girls I started dating asked me out to a bar with her friends. They were awesome, and I had an awesome time.  I started doing this new thing where I reiterate all of the strange topics we talked about after the conversation so their logical brain could save what their emotional brain was just working on.  I call this writing RAM onto the Hard Drive, and though it is tricky to balance, It seems to be working well for establishing long term investment, i.e. keeping me on their mind.  I met up with another buddy, and spent the majority of the night trying to help him through his AA, mainly by picking him up and placing him awkwardly but hilariously inside of sets of women, and Just holding awkward eye contact with them until either he said something, or they said something.  But I digress, we went over to this divebar/dance club (as weird as that sounds and I got some me time)\n\n**Set 45:**  I approached this HB6 and her HB7 friend and started chatting with them. After hooking up with a bunch of hotter women the weekend before, I was rushing things a little. Within the first couple minutes I was already trying to kiss her.  I eventually got a kiss with my betting on what my name is routine (which I still don't understand why it works, cause its my name).  Her HB7 walks up and wants to get in on the action so I bring her in to the sexual innuendos and ask them to kiss which is refused but replaced with both of them kissing me at the same time.  I am looking for a quick score so I blow off the HB7 which was a bad idea, because she then proceeded to cock block hard.  Well lesson learned.  She dragged off the HB6 and I was blown out.\n\n**Set 46:** I immediately approached a cute goth girl, not sure about her HB status, but I would say HB7-8 dressed up for the evening, but HB6 in goth clothing?  anyways, I was just looking to keep up the streak, so I initiated kinoing and had her in my arms in a minute, I stared into her eyes and kept eye contact until we were eating each others faces. I think I was talking about metalocalypse, and being a white preppy kid but style is just style as I've been shot at twice in L.A..  We were laughing the whole time, so I don't think she realized I was being serious.  Anyways, I'm not interested in white girls so I got her number listened to her text stream over the next few days and let it die.\n\nI wonder is this mindset of plenty is immoral or selfish in any way, or if men and women are just finally becoming equals.  Whatever, its 5:09 AM and I have work in an hour, then homework all day, then I have to see two chicks I'm dating, and I hope there is time to go out and meet more chicks. So apologies for the short post, but I'M OUT!","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}
{"body":"I only go for the number if it's been a quality interaction and I've seen a lot of IOIs. Between a FWB and about 6 or 7 numbers in my phone I'm trying to arrange hangouts with, I already don't have time for all the numbers I have, so I don't want to add in another one unless it's a quality one. In the 25+ approach challenge, there honestly weren't any interactions long enough to warrant getting a number. Not my usual style, just the way I wanted to start this 100 set challenge thing.\n\nI'm not trying to sound cocky, but I HAVE done a lot of approaching and gaming prior to this. I just got into an approaching rut over the past few weeks so I decided to just bash a bunch out to get over that. \n\nEDIT: But, yeah. I have probably gotten anywhere from 10-20 numbers from girls that either never responded or never agreed to meet up, and the common theme is that my interaction with them wasn't very good (As in I wasn't really direct but grabbed their number as they were leaving, or grabbed the number after chatting for like 5 minutes and left, or whatever). The numbers that I've gotten that HAVE led to dates or sex typically (but not always) involve longer interactions and serious IOIs (Kclose, or girl asking if she can give me her number kinda thing).\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}
{"body":"I work in a university setting, so hopefully there will be much progress and experience. These approaches took place yesterday. \n\n\n#1 - Two black guys sitting on a bench in a hallway. They were talking about something, didn't listen. One looked up and made eye contact for a half second. I said, \"Whaddup.\" One responded. Kept walking.\n\n\n#2 - I'm walking into an empty classroom to update the computers and find there are 2 guys inside. One is studying, and the other is drawing on the whiteboard. It looks like someone playing beer pong. I complimented him on his drawing skills. He said he had been drawing since the 4th grade. I mentioned I recently started to practice piano, and got into a conversation about how much practice sucks, but how essential it is, then progressed into doing whatever it is that makes you happy. The other person mentioned their upcoming math test, and I finished my updates. Bid them both a nice day.\n\n\n#3 - Immediately after walking out of the classroom, I see it's raining pretty damn hard. Out of a classroom walks a short, petite girl (my type) about a 6, but could tell she didn't put too much effort in today. I told her I was happy that it's finally spring and that it's storming instead of snowing. She said that May will be a beautiful month with all the rain we have been getting. She called the elevator, and asked me if I was going down. I declined, as I'd rather take the stairs (cause I'm not lazy). In hindsight, this would have been a great opportunity to continue the conversation with her. Oh well. Live and learn. It's what I'm doing this for, is to teach myself, and maybe a few others.\n\n\n#4 - As I was walking back to my office, I heard someone with heels was walking behind me for a minute. I turned and said, \"Do your heels have a mute button?\" As I turned my head, smiling a little smile, I see she is an older lady (~35) and took what I said somewhat seriously. I began to exaggerate the motions and sounds and she laughed. I went back to my office.\n\n\n#5 - I'm in line at Chipotl\u00e9 for dinner (I work the night shift). A guy walks in behind me and mentions how this sucks. I said not to worry, they are quick and the wait is not long at all. He mentioned the weather. I went on about how great that it's finally spring and warm and shit. What he meant was his house is close to a river and is concerned it will flood (been raining pretty damn hard). I recently purchased my own house a year ago, so I could relate. Feeling a little bit like a prick, I asked him what he did for a living, and said he is a fireman in the same city that I live. I thanked him for his services, though I have not personally been a recipient (thankfully). He said to thank the mayor as he signs his checks. He asked me what I am doing moving to city WXYZ. I've been all around the region for work and making my way to Chicago. Asked him if he's ever seen theChive.com. He has and it's a great website. By now, my bowl is being built and I mention how much I like Chipotl\u00e9 because they are not skimpy with their ingredients. I'm ready to leave, so I ask the guy for his name. It was Jim. We shook hands. Told him to have a great day and stay dry. I noticed Jim was somewhat nervous/fidgety, his eyes were darting all around the restaurant.\n\n\nNot bad for day 1. I've noticed that watching the eyes is a great indicator of whether or not someone is willing to be opened.\n\n\nFor myself:\n\nFind my natural happy loving smile. Trying to fake smile comes off as plastic and artificial.\n\n\nDefault to action. If someone makes eye contact, even for half a second, say something.\n\n\nDon't be so serious. I'm really serious. A lot. Stop it and lighten up.\n\n\nDon't be so reactionary. Chill out and settle down. \n\n\nLISTEN ACTIVELY, don't try to game a conversation and be dominant.

My technique goes as follows: Smile and grin to every motherfucker that crosses my path, even if they're grumpy-looking. This gets me into my \"happy place\". When I spot a target, I just say to myself \"YOLO\" and walk up to her. Sometimes I spot something to talk about to open with, but most of the time I'm just put on the spot to start a conversation. Just say whatever is on my mind. My thoughts are often influenced by where I am or what's happening around me. \n\nFor instance, if I'm on the street and nothing is happening, I just say how gorgeous the weather is/how I wish the weather was better. I can make a joke about feeling like a lizard, hiding in the cold and coming out for the sun.\n\nIf I'm in a coffee shop, I'll ask what she's going to get, make a reply to her answer (whether or not I like her choice), and then talk about coffee/muffins/food/workers/long queues/that cool dress she's wearing/how tired I am from yesterday and need coffee to wake up/if coffee is bad for you but drinking water all the time is boring/ etc. etc.\n\nI really just make it up as I go along.

Convinced two older ladies to get down on the dance floor, and it was pretty decent. #6 didn't believe I was single, but eyed me all night, even when a more well-versed man tried to take her home.\n\n7/8. After making a fool of myself on the dance floor, I opened two lasses who were laughing. Blown out harder than a donut on an 18 wheeler.\n\n9. Opened another older lady at the bar.

I woke up in an apartment I didn't realize after a night of hemiboners and realized what I had done. It was terrible, but then I remembered that I just had sex, and this was the most awesome sunrise I've ever witnessed\n\nThings I learned:\n\n1. Pay attention to body language.

Having someone hold me accountable made me go out and do stuff more than I would usually.\n\n3.

{"body":"January 26th, 2013: \nBackground: We are having a social event at the fraternity house. It's a kegger, nothing too big or fancy. Everyone invites friends and we have a good Saturday night. We casually tell these girls in a sorority to come by and about 15 of them show up (not a scheduled mixer.)\n\n* 1 - There is a group of girls standing close to the bar. They range from HB4-8 and there are at least 6 of them. I grab one of our pledges (guys who are in the process of joining our fraternity, let's call him Matt) because he was asking me how I would approach girls at these things, and directly go up to them and introduce myself and Matt. I shake hands with all of them and we make small talk. After chatting I realize that one of them (unfortunately one of the less attractive girls of the group) is the social chair (the girl who organizes social events) for the sorority we casually invited over. At that point, I dropped the whole trying to meet attractive girls mindset and wanted to isolate her so I can get to know her and impress her so that she'd be more inclined to cooperatively organize social events with us. Her name is Allison (one of my rules is to remember names). \n\nIsolating her wasn't too hard. We entered a discussion about the differences between sorority and fraternity houses and I ended up giving her a tour of the house. We then played beer pong (we won of course) and she seemed to genuinely have a good time. At that point the night was advancing and I realized that I should talk to other girls because while Allison was fairly interesting, she was more-so just someone I wanted to have good relations with and be friends with. I made sure she meet up with her friends and I headed in search of another social opportunity. \n\n* 2 - I go to the dance floor where everyone is doing the [wobble](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd6UI6wEIsU). Personally, I hate dancing the same dance in a group. I don't see the fun in just standing there following instructions to a dance collectively on a dance floor. That's just me though. \n\nAnyway, I see this tall, attractive girl; an HB8. She was doing the wobble pretty well and I suck at this dance. I start \"dancing\" the wobble next to her, then look at her, and say \"You're a wobble pro! How do I do this?\" She smiles, and gives me short instructions. After the song was over we stopped and then I left because there was a delay before people started actually dancing on the dance floor again. After 15 minutes I pass the dance floor again and there she is dancing with about 2-3 guys around her obviously just waiting for an invitation to dance with her.\n\nAt that point I realize it'd be a great opportunity to do two things: dance with her, and show these two guys what a man does and assert my alpha (I need to get my confidence up a bit.) I walk up to her, put my hand on her back, not too low, not too high (listen to Hitch!) and say \"Let's dance.\" She obliges me and we start dancing. \n\nOur dancing gets really heavy. And I mean **really heavy**. It was very sexual. Our hands kept tightening on each others and her body got really close to mine. She would take her hand and stroke the back of my head and if we were holding hands make me hug her and squeeze while dancing. It was awesome, really, and I thought I had struck gold. I spun her around and we started dancing face to face. Our faces were really close and then she laid a nuke on me. \n\n\"Hey, I have a boyfriend. I really like dancing with you, but we can't hook-up.\" \n\nFine. In all honesty, I didn't mind that. I was intoxicated and it was a casual friendly dance. Fine. I made a quip \"So it's a bad idea to ask for your number?\" She giggles and says \"It is.\" We keep dancing and at the end she kisses me on the cheek and says \"Thanks you, you're awesome.\" I say \"You too. Let me know when you break up with your boyfriend.\" I only later realized that that was kind of douchey or whatever, but it made her laugh. Her name is Katherine and I'm sure I'll see her again. Not that I necessarily intend to hit on a girl with a bf, but I do want to see her again.\n\n* 3 - Last girl of the night. The party is winding down and there aren't as many girls to choose from. i notice one of my fraternity brothers is extremely intoxicated and being quite the funny fool (he wasn't in danger, he's just a sarcastic and witty guy that was being really funny at his own expense.) It was hilarious and there were a group of girls enjoying the scene. I go up to them and apologize for my friend (best drunk, unknowing wingman ever) and I ended up isolating the cutest girl in the circle (who was still an HB6). Her name was Emily and she said that I was very mean to her one night when she was trying to get her friend into one of our parties. I told her that I didn't remember that, that I was sorry, and that I explained that it was my responsibility that night (I was assigned a risk management position) to keep everyone safe and the party in order. She didn't buy it right away but I wasn't going to apologize twice. She made a *very* slightly aggressive comment and I took full advantage and said that she was being mean back and that we were now equal. She laughed.\n\nI managed to steer the convo towards music. This was good because I learned that she was very proud of her music repertoire. Fine. We picked a couple of songs to play for the party, got into a convo about Lollapalooza and then I asked her to dance. She was a HORRIBLE, **HORRIBLE** dancer. I was glad the song we put on skipped and she had to go fix it. I decide to just walk away. \n\nLater on, I see Emily with her coat on waiting for her friends to leave. I figure, hey, why not, practice your number close and get her number. I end up going up to her and saying, \"Hey, mean guy here. You seem like someone I'd like to get to know better and I was wondering if you wouldn't mind giving me your number.\" She made one of those \"Ummmmmmmmmm, sure\" to say \"I want to give you my number but I also want to make you feel like I don't really or I'm unsure.\" Whatever, she gave it away by smiling the whole time. I don't intend on texting her often or romantically but I wouldn't mind calling her to come over to fill up a party. Also, I'm just trying to build my game and confidence up. \n\n*So there you go.

{"body":"Sets **58/** and **59/**: School's finally done and I went out to a club with a bunch of friends. My buddy dares me to go up to a bunch of girls standing near a limo parked on the side of the street. He gives me this cheesy pickup line: \"Hey do you have a map cuz I'm lost in your eyes.\" I opened the set with that line and they start laughing. I talk to them for a bit, apparently one of the girls' sisters had gotten engaged and was having a girls night out. I ejected and my buddy points out this big-titted chick in a red dress. I open her with the same line. She starts laughing and we're having some sexualized banter. She then gets uninterested and leaves.

But remember, it\u2019s not about entertaining her, it\u2019s about exuding non-neediness and genuine interest in her.\n\nAll right, so you should always be somewhat honest in what you're feeling and so on, sorta like when I'm really nervous, I could say something like: \"well, i'm actually quite nervous doing this, but I had to tell you how cute you are\" or as simple as you said it, I wanted to meet you.\n\nI also thought of one other thing, are you trying to find girls that might look interesting to you in how she dresses and not just cute? get the feeling that it would be a lot easier talking to someone who for some reason caught your attention outside from the good looks.\u00b4\n\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

{"body":"Maybe I should have elaborated #15 a bit more, I just talked to her for a while at the bar, being myself. It's quite a dead end right now but at the time it looked promising. The plan was to add her on fb and talk more there but I just cba to do the effort if I didn't push it the same night i met her which was because of # 13. We've been slowtexting over the course of like a month and she said she was coming over to my uni town. So we were at a bar with a group of friends where number 15  was in. 13 had sent me a text and came to that same bar, she taped my shoulder and gave me a kiss on my cheeks, I said hey wtf are you doing, grabbed her and made out with her. Then took her home, making regular stops just pushing her against the wall feeling her breasts and making out which made her super horny. We had sex with some really good music ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUkkaqSNduU ) and then we walked back to where the bars where and went back to our friends. Just being alpha in general tbh. She tol me a couple of times how much she liked it and that we should do it again so I must be doing something right.","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

{"body":"I've been really busy the last couple of days. This summer I signed up for an Ultimate Frisbee team and a Soccer team. I had first games with them both over the weekend, and I even found time for a hiking day out to a lake with a friend, and chess in a cafe with another friend. So while I haven't been hitting on girls, I have been sociable none-the-less. I think that's just as important, if not moreso.\n\n**21:** Girl with facepaint. I saw her standing alone on the train platform. Just walked up and said hi. I then saw she had facepaint on her face, so we bantered a bit about volunteering and facepaint designs (tigers, ghosts, etc.). I wasn't feeling very confident today, so I ran out of steam with trying to force conversation.\n\n**22:** Berlin girl. Quiet and cute lady, I've been to Berlin before so it was easy to find common ground. This is one of the few sets that I focused on getting her into conversation, and then stopping her to stand a chat in the middle of the sidewalk, without continuing to walk. Again sort of ran out of \"umph\" in my conversation, but was much smoother than facepaint girl.\n\n**BONUS:** Older gentleman on the train. He was stood next to me, so I said hi and found out he was from Romania, and his son goes to the same university as me. Easy to build rapport from there.","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

She seemed pleasantly suprised but quickly said she had a boyfriend. I said no worries and continued walking. Problem i have at the minute is the lack of attractive girls in my area. I was out for about two hours again yesterday and she was one of three girls i saw above a 5. Still that's just making excuses. ","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

{"body":"Thoughts: I need to focus my game on some specific aspects as opposed to going for the whole thing all at once. I feel like I'm super off-calibrated and my game is very erratic \n\nI realize the purpose of club game though, which is that it allows you to meet the most women (including the hottest women) in a single environment all at once. This teaches you to maintain state, deal with objections, deal with bitch shields, recognize IOIs, develop strong kino and overall make your game much more dense. It also teaches you how to develop attraction right off the bat \n\nAt the same time, anyone can run around with their head cut off opening girl after girl at a club. The hard part is making an interaction stick and be able to consistently draw results. \n\nI've decided to focus my game into four main facets. The first of which, that I've been doing and will continue to be doing is 1) process fine-tuning. This will be my main focus until the end of February\n\nWhat is process fine tuning? Basically being able to open, maintain strong posture, eye contact and tonality and get an interaction going. Standing close and being able to move things forward both verbally and physically. Focusing all mental energy and being able to instantly recognize an IOI or an IOD. These are all key fundamentals and I need to focus my effort on them NOW rather than later \n\nThis may hurt my results for now, but I need to focus on the fundamentals that will help in the long run ","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

{"body":"3)  After a few days of being lazy (why can't I go out and sarge consistently every day?  I seem to go into hermit mode every few days)  I tried to go to the zoo to practice day game.  Utter failure, there weren't many sets there during the day, mostly families and a few groups of unattractive girls.  I went in with a decent amount of confidence/frame, but it went down as the day went on and kept me from approaching the few sets I wanted to.  Damn AA.\n\nLater at night I hit the bars.  I hit up a local favorite of mine, and sat at the bar.  Next to me was a 2-set.  Tried to smile at them, they didn't see or ignore me.  Try to open with \"Hey, how's it going?\" and they basically ignore me, then get up and leave to go to the back of the bar.  My first complete failure (and it's not that bad).\n\n4)  HB7 walks up to the bar and I again do my simple opener \"How's it going?\"  She has some very long dangly feather earrings so I use them as an opportunity to drive the conversation, start kino, and perhaps some sexual banter all at once.  I say \"those are awesome earings, don't they tickle your shoulders?\"  She smiles and says \"no not really.  You're like the 3rd or 4th guy to compliment me on these today, but they were all black guys (I'm a white guy).  I was wondering if they were only cool to black people.\"  I say \"Well, I guess I break the mold\"   I have her laughing.  I reach in for the earings and brush them against her neck.  \"So they don't tickle you like that?\"  She laughs and says no.  I ask if she's just not a ticklish person in general.  She says that she was but that her grandmother held her down and tickled her by force until she got over it.  We talk about being ticklish in general and she shows me the one spot where she is still ticklish (an IOI right?)\n\nI say I detect a slight accent and ask where she is from.  She tells me to guess.  I ask if I can narrow it down by region, and (basically I kind of did cold reading I guess) get to Denmark by the 3rd guess, which is close enough I guess.  She is Norwegian and says I probably don't know much about Norway.  I say I know a bit, and again, the smallest bit of knowledge about her culture (in this case knowing the capital was Oslo) breaks down her barriers.  She is into me now!  Plus, I'm realizing I may have a thing for foreign women.  Didn't know that was a \"type\" of mine before, but it makes sense.  My last girlfriend was also not American.  Anyway, just as I'm doing well, her friends come and take her away to another corner of the bar.  I'm not done with her yet, but first...\n\n5)  5 is crash and burn.  I ask her if she did anything fun that day, she tells me she got back from tango lessons, and I stammer something about salsa (trying to DHV that I know how to salsa) but it comes across as needy and she leaves pretty quickly.\n\nI decide to leave the bar, but first I go back to Norway who is with her friends and I decide to #-close her.  Normally I would be nervous about this, but I knew I was smooth with her in my opener.  I walk up to her and say \"Norway (I used her real name actually) was it?  I wish we could have talked a bit longer.  Could I get your # so we can continue the conversation?\"  She replies with \"Absolutely!\"  (Score!!) and gives me her number.  I put it into my phone and walk out of the bar.\n\nDisaster!  10 steps out of the bar, I realize that the number did not save properly to the phone.  I have to go back into the bar and ask her again.  I go up again (she's already talking to another guy!), try to smile and keep my BL strong but say \"I'm embarrassed.  It didn't save your #.\"  She laughs and says \"that's bad game.\"  I laugh and say \"I'm actually new to this, cut me some slack.\"  She gives me the # again.\n\nFollow-up:  I ask her out over text, but logistics don't work out.  I'm gone for a road trip the next day and don't get back for a week.  She goes back to Norway.  Oh well, first #-close.  And I think I did a lot right with this one.","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

{"body":"Made it to 25 today! Wahoo! Here's my quarter-centurion analysis: It's really easy to walk up to anyone and say hi. It's a little more difficult finding refreshing topics of conversation, but that falls into place with enough practice. Generally, people seem pretty happy to chat randomly with a stranger. I only posted openings with girls that I felt counted. I lost count of the total number of people I opened, tons of guys and cashiers and bus drivers and everyone who was standing around me at the time. I'm just opening everybody.\n\nI got no numbers, but I only asked for one. I only did one direct opener, all the rest were indirect. I only opened 1-sets, no 2- or 3- sets. I didn't flirt - not sure how, but I think it will come with time and confidence.\n\n***Goals for the next 25:*** At least 5 direct openers. At least 5 attempts at getting a number. Open at least 1 2-set. Open at least 1 3-set.\n\nAlso really considering doing a daygame bootcamp at the end of month. I want to crush my AA before then, so I'm aiming to complete 100 by the end of May. That may be pushing it, but I feel like pushing myself.\n\n---\n\n**23:** Older lady on the bus.

I was sat in front of her, and we drove past some townhouses under construction in the neighbourhood. I turned around and said \"Did you see that?\" in a mildly outraged voice. Things flowed from there. Turns out we both had to transfer to another bus, the same one, and I kept the conversation going for about 15 minutes.\n\n**24:** Cutie in a dress on the street corner. Just walked up to her and opened with my lizard opener. She seemed a bit put off by my approaching her, but she replied when I spoke. I ejected soon after.\n\n**25:** Big boobed girl on the train. I don't even remember what we talked about, I just saw her, walked up and started a conversation. I felt like I was forcing the conversation, but I was able to keep it up for almost 10 minutes.
