{"body":"**Updated my [initial post](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1wa41h/the_image_that_can_break_your_brain/cf0437p) and am copying it here for anyone that is reading**\n\n\nI have a lot of free time, im going to try for 10 minutes of induction.\n\n\n**EDIT:** I started with maybe 2 or 3 minutes of induction and am still seeing the effect nearly 40 minutes later. I used the images from [this](http://www.cheswick.com/ches/projects/me/) site. The magenta is less obvious than the green. If the effect is gone tomorrow when I wake up I will try it with green/red and for a full 10 minutes.\n\n**EDIT 2:** 60 minutes later and I still have the effect. Its kinda creeping me out. Will report back tomorrow morning.\n\n**EDIT 3:** Effects still very very clear after almost 9.5 hours and a good 8 hours sleep. I will do the 10 minutes of induction today in the hopes of strengthening the effect.\n\n**EDIT 4:** Effects completely gone (and almost reversed) after using the [image](http://i.imgur.com/yGd6L5a.png) in the [comments below](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1wa41h/the_image_that_can_break_your_brain/cf05sm5), created by /u/Godd2. Thank you Godd2!\n\nI still plan on doing the 10 minute induction, especially now that I know the effects can be reversed relatively easy. \n\n**EDIT 5:** I reversed the effects from my first 2 minute trial and began a new one. I used the [green lines](http://www.cheswick.com/ches/projects/me/Fig/h.gr.gif) from the link I posted and the [red lines](http://www.cheswick.com/ches/projects/me/Fig/v.red.gif) instead of the magenta ones.\n\nInitial thoughts was that the green was far less obvious this time round, even though I did a full 10 minute induction. The red shows up though but also much more subtle than I expected. It has been 9 hours since the induction and the effect is still apparent. Its just much more subtle than after my 2 minute induction with green/magenta. I am assuming this is due to using red instead of magenta. \n\nI also made a point of looking at the other coloured line images in the link I posted to see if this effect worked over the top of other colours. It does not appear to have any effect. \n\nIn addition to that I looked at images with lines that were different thicknesses and spaces. In my experience the effect is only very subtle on some of these. Generally the closer to the thickness and spacing of the original lines the stronger the effect.\n\n**There is literally no change in my normal vision**. People on here claiming that purple links are now blue or that the space between the lines of text is coloured are likely to be full of shit or making crappy jokes. This is not how the effect works. I have not seen the effect at all during my normal day, though as I said above, its almost non existent on lined images that are different from those used for the induction. \n\n**What I actually see:** If you take a look at the black stripes that appear at the top of [this](http://www.cheswick.com/ches/projects/me/) page, you will see a white space between the lines. For me, I get colour between the lines. Red between the horizontal ones and green between the vertical ones.\n\nI am going to sleep soon and will hopefully get a chance to test in the morning, though I do have to leave early to travel somewhere. I will be staying at home tomorrow and will not have my computer so I may not get to update until the following day.\n\nCiao\n\n**EDIT 6:** It has been about 48 hours since the 10 minute induction and the effects have gone. As I stated after the induction, the effects seemed much weaker when using the green/red images instead of the green/magenta. I never noticed the effects during normal everyday life, only while looking at the test images.\n\nI might try again in the future with the green/magenta images.","subreddit_id":"t5_2zzob","subreddit":"02keilj"}

{"body":"Bernkastel.\n\nShe's the common link between the two series of When They Cry, and the way in which she only reveals small parts of her character bit-by-bit is fascinating to read. Starting at the beginning of Minagoroshi where she makes her first appearance by *having a conversation with the reader*, her Higurashi personality is understandably constrained by the fact that she's still tied to Rika, who is still tied to June of Shouwa 58. Once they finally break free of that fate (with your help to rig the dice, no less), she's naturally elated along with the rest of us.\n\nAnd then Saikoroshi-hen happens. Hanyu decides she needs to grow up and tosses her into a world where everything is completely different, and she breaks down completely. In the end here, Rika recognises that she and Bernkastel are not the same, and Bern is finally \"freed\" from her connection to Rika. So she immediately goes to some more kakera and starts messing with them. She's also grown attached to you, which you realise for the first time when she shares the kakera with you to play with as well. And that's the last we hear from her for a thousand years. From what we learn of her in Higurashi alone, it's somewhat difficult to call her (or understand what exactly her existence is), but she appears to be decent enough.\n\nEverything that happened between the end of Higurashi and the beginning of Umineko can only be pieced together from bits and pieces dropped during the latter, which makes putting together exactly what *happened* to make her what she is in the second series quite the experience. She meets Lambda (who was presumably on the sidelines like us the whole time during Higurashi munching popcorn) and Featherine (who had a still unexplainable connection with Hanyu which would appear to provide the miko association the pair have). Then Bern and Lambda go on adventures to completely new sets of kakera, and Bern gradually begins to grow bored of everything, even though as a Voyager she can literally do *everything*. It's a scary thought.\n\nThen one day, she runs into the reader again at the gameboard of Rokkenjima. And my god, how she'd transformed since your last encounter with her. It doesn't help that she immediately starts talking to you again as soon as Beato leaves, and it *really* doesn't help when one of the first things she says is \"SO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT I AM A WITCH, RIGHT?\" Then in Ep2 she confirms that she is the same person from Higurashi with her Wham Line of \"Mii~. Nipah~*! \u2026\u2026\u2026 it's a bit embarrassing. See how far I go for your sake.\" I just. Ryukishi is far too good at writing characters, especially ones whose very existence terrifies like Bernkastel's. But hey, at least it's nice to know that in a thousand years she still hasn't forgotten you, right? Though with what she instigates in Chiru, that might not be a good thing...\n\nThe true nature of what her boredom means is revealed when she hijacks the game board and starts trolling the hell out of everyone. Throughout the remaining four arcs, things really sink in more and more that a thousand years *twisted* her, yet because of what you achieved together in Higurashi it's surprisingly difficult to hate her for the antics she's causing and she knows it. Eventually we reach Ep8, with the climatic battle between Battler and Bernkastel for the fate of the game board. And Battler just punches her. To most people, being punched isn't the end of the world. Not so for Bernkastel, who hasn't felt pain since she left Rika a thousand years ago. If her reaction isn't a hook for character development in the next installment of When They Cry, I don't know what is. Inevitably, she is defeated and the tale of Umineko is finally settled. But she clearly is still rather attached to you, as she and Lambda proudly proclaim \"See you again, when something else cries.\"\n\nI've gone *way* overboard on detailing her rather than saying why I like her so much, but I kind of feel that it's necessary to point out that it's surprisingly difficult to really understand her motivations. Perhaps the final nail in the coffin is in the extra TIP \"The Witches' Tanabata\", where she happily states \"Therefore. I will show you a true, witch-like, granting of a wish. Because you're obviously looking forward to that.\" immediately before sending everything to hell. Again. But seriously, even after a thousand years she hasn't forgotten you, though you could perhaps say that her expectations of what you would like to see have mutated somewhat. (**tl;dr? Skip to here**) Bernkastel really is a character that I could go on about for pages and pages and *still* not explain everything about her, and so I suppose that, if nothing else, is why she is my favourite character and why she's fully half the reason I'm looking forward to the next installment of When They Cry as much as I am.","subreddit_id":"t5_30l1t","subreddit":"07thexpansion"}

{"body":"While reading Higurashi for the first time I'd have picked Ooishi. In a world of fantastical events, it was great to have one character that felt grounded in reality. He isn't acting to save the world, he doesn't have super powers, he just works diligently and competently at his job. While the story never spends much time with him, the few crumbs it drops about his life are enough to paint a comprehensive picture of his life. He's the perfect example of \"show, don't tell,\" for example, his slight disdain for authority and self-confidence being hinted at through his inappropriate smoking. \n\nHowever after finishing Higurashi, I'd need to pick Miyo. For the first ~6 episodes she is a fairly dull background character, but after her reveal as the \"villain\" in EP7 I went in to EP8 eagerly anticipating her downfall. I'd read Umineko previously so I was aware R07 had a tendency to write sympathetic villains, and the scenes of her childhood implied he would attempt to do the same with Miyo in EP8. I tried to hold onto my desire for revenge, reminding myself of the horrific acts she had committed in other time-lines, but one late scene broke me. Of all the many tear jerking moments in Higurashi, the one that got to me the most was a relatively minor event in what should otherwise have been a joyous moment. In the final chapters of EP8 where Miyo is being apprehended, her failure is complete, the \"good guys\" have won, everyone cheers. But as she is being handcuffed she inadvertently drops her grandfathers research notes into the mud where they are crunched underfoot by the security personnel. In her desperate yet pitiful cries to save the paperwork I realise she isn't a woman, she's just an abused little girl in an adults body, desperately trying to hold on to the only person who ever gave her a sense of love and safety. I couldn't look at Miyo the same way after that moment.\n\nFrom Umineko I'm going to exclude Yasu as it she has an unfair advantage in that the story primarily revolves around her. Of the remaining cast, I'd have to pick Eva. I like characters that aren't gifted with advantages but still struggle to make a their mark upon the world. In Eva's case she's born in a time, country, and family which is strongly patriarchal. But rather than meekly accept her pre-ordained role as a submissive wife, she challenges it through every means available. From internal family power struggles, to learning martial arts she asserts herself. She isn't afraid to speak her mind and doesn't back down from a fight. Her scenes are always entertaining, with her stream of subtle jabs and her words always carry weight due to their multiple meanings. But what makes her really interesting is that her outward appearance of strength is brittle. In her scenes alone with Hideyoshi she's shown to be afraid to even admit to a severe headache in front of her siblings, and her brittle strength is snapped by the events on Rokkenjima as demonstrated through her later abuse of Ange.","subreddit_id":"t5_30l1t","subreddit":"07thexpansion"}

Her points are perverted, twisted logic with no love, and lots of her behavior is R07 taking potshots at readers. Yet she is still right from certain points of view. It's part of the reason Umineko is so good. Even the villain's argument carries just as much weight as the protagonists'.","subreddit_id":"t5_30l1t","subreddit":"07thexpansion"}

{"body":"Available devices will depend on how the gameplay experimenting goes. The virtual computer already accounts for having a multitude of attached devices of course. It also accounts for hot swapping of devices, although that's probably overkill.\nThere is a kind of unified way of thinking about how to program the several devices which hopefully will be flexible enough for any randoms devices I might need.\nThe reason there aren't any other than the default devices is I didn't want to spend time on things that are so gameplay dependent without being confident what direction I would take.\n\nBut yes, usual suspects will certainly be doors, switches, weapons, shields, coms, radar.\n\nNow that I digged through my memories... that idea I mentioned was more like 18-16 years ago! Damn I feel old now.\nShort version went something like this:\n\n* Earth resources are depleted and humanity is in despair\n* An FLT drive is found in some ruins\n* Humanity travels to another planet which is rich in resources, but a war starts there for the resources.\n* Gameplay was ground based with mech-type huge robots. I remember I was inspired by \"Robot Jox (1989)\", which I saw a couple of years before. :)\n* Players could customize their mechs with different weapons, radars, targeting, etc.\n* Every mech would have an on-board computer you could program to help you control all the modules. (I got that one from an old arena type game where you could code little robots in C and get them to fight)\n\nYep, I know it was cheesy. :)\nSo the combat itself wasn't space based.\nWell that was long ago, and will work on whatever I think it will be interesting.\n\nVery likely my first experiments will be space based and/or some kind of ground based combat.\n\nAlthough from my point of view, for the concept of programmable computer to be successfully in the current market, it will need to be something slow paced, where people can thinker with the computer, explore, and share creations, so I doubt something action oriented will turn out any good in the long run.\n\nI'm really looking forward to experiment with gameplay using all this stuff I was working on for so long, to be honest. :)\nTime will tell!

{"body":"Sure, and I do realise how easy it is to make a quick dismissive comment vs difficult it is to produce something.\n\nThere are 2 things I would say are key to the project.  First, defining what it is/should be - a vision, a structure, some key requirements.  The less defined that is, the more directionless progress will be.\n\nThe second is wisely spending time and resources to achieve said requirements.  The first step then is working out at a high level what needs to be done, namely:\n\n* Game design\n* Narrative\n* Client code\n* Server code\n* Gameplay code\n* Creative assets\n...\n\nThe next thing to do is reduce risk in the project - first thing anyone would notice is the very large amount of technical risk and unknowns - namely in the server architecture.  Let's have a look at project risk:\n\n* Game design, narrative - low risk: you need to keep it close to the 0x10c vision to keep the fanbase, but it's a starting point for a game designer, they don't have to come up with the idea from scratch\n* Client code - medium risk: the environment size internally doesn't require new vis algorithms to be created, perhaps since it's in space there needs to be some research into physically correct star rendering, maybe planet rendering\n* Server code - high risk: persistent CPU sims, large distributed server systems, hundreds (hopefully thousands) of clients, comms, travel, I would imagine all CPU and ship logic happening here\n* Gameplay code - low risk: depending on the game design of course, but this seemed to be another fairly sandbox-y game, so not huge amounts of AI, pathfinding, complex quest objectives, etc.\n* Creative assets - low risk: as before, there already exists a starting point, and doesn't seem to be a huge volume of unknown work to do\n\nNext it's come up with a plan.  Tackle each of these in the most efficient way.  If tackling a point with medium or high risk, use other's knowledge or existing solutions to reduce that risk.\n\nCase in point - to get the client together, you use experience.  That could be your own experience - you could put together a new rendering/physics engine - as Notch did.  That seemed to come together over the course of a couple of months?  And had fluid movement and physics, built-in editor, a great visual style, etc.\n\nOR, you could use other's experience and leverage that - for example, an existing engine.  Of which there are a few options.  Unity *is* an option.  \u00a350 for Windows 8 you might think is a reasonable cost per developer given their time would usually be worth many times that per hour.\n\nHowever, much effort and some progress considered, Trillek has gone for the first option, but WITHOUT the experience.  Many more weeks and months to achieve something without a decent aesthetic.  Physics, lighting, interactivity, movement - are really, really not good.\n\n...and that's not even tackling the main problem.  Despite this, the biggest risk still exists.  You need someone who *really* knows what they are doing to build the complex, self-sustaining distributed server-side systems.\n\nGames are fun to build, they are interesting to build.

{"body":"A lot of brainstorming went into deciding how all the pieces fit together.\nThe instruction set, how to program the devices, feasibility for high level compilers. Required lots of going back and changing stuff as I ported the C compiler. :) The only thing I'm not that happy about is that It's not as easy as the DCPU-16 if you go with assembly.\n\nSo, for the virtual computer, you can at the moment code with assembly or C. A BASIC interpreter will come shortly, as I improve the Operating System to have a file system.\n\nDepending if interest grows for assembly, I might have to simplify some things, or at least have some assembly pseudo instructions (an instruction that is really assembled as several instructions).\n\nI'll need to finish the technical documents and see what people think of the level of difficulty. That will take a while, since I'm a 1 man team, and there are lots of stuff I need to do the next couple of days/weeks. :)\n\nThe servers and the game itself are in C++.\n\nFor the engine, I bought a license for the C4 engine over 1 year ago to use on this project. It's not as well known as other engines, but it has really clean code, and it's easier to tweak by 1 guy.\nBut it's very likely that I will just use the Unreal Engine 4, since it's the engine I use at work, so there is crossover with learning new stuff. Faster that way, since anything I learn at work or at home will be useful.\nHopefully my wife won't remember I've spent 500euros on something I won't use! :)\n\nAnyone that wants to take a look at the DevKit will at the moment need to download the repository with the OS source code and the DevKit binaries (they are available separately).\nSince there no documentation about the architecture, all you can do is take a look at the OS source code and launch it.\nThe main page at the repository has the essential instructions.\n\nAs a quick fix I'll record some short videos soon showing the basic workflow for the DevKit.\n\n\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

The unreal engine most likely cannot handle this type of emulation on a large scale (numerous PC consoles all running multiple applications at once to keep ship running). I do wish you good luck.\n\nTLDR: Unreal engine graphics specs are well known no need to showcase.

{"body":"what is the aim of the game?","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}
{"body":"You don't need a different CPU to target C code; the DCPU Toolchain ships with a C compiler that targets the original DCPU just fine.  There's the LLVM port as well (but I don't know how far that got).\n\nIt's quite possible to write large and complex systems in the DCPU; it might not be practical in assembly but you can do it in C.  It just means you can't bring in most modern libraries since they're designed for running on x86/x64 hardware and thus assume more RAM is available (though I'd be guessing most of them assume things about a 32-bit architecture that just aren't the case in the DCPU anyway).\n\nADDITIONAL:\n\nI'd argue that as people developing the game you want to avoid being the people who develop the tools (e.g. building a C compiler).  The reason behind this is that communities around games often form when there is something to do other than actually playing the game, whether that's modding, running wikis or forums, etc.  0x10c is a perfect example of this; there wasn't actually a game to play, but the community could go out and build things and have fun with them, and that kept the community engaged.  If you start going off and doing everything for the people who will play your game, then there's a distinct section of people who will no longer be actively involved in the community (because the role that they might otherwise play has been negated by the game developer doing it).\n\nWhether this applies to open source games in the same way that it applies to commercial games I can't say; but if I had to take a bet I'd say that it does.","subreddit_id":"t5_2tu92","subreddit":"0x10c"}

{"body":"Hello everyone. \n\n**Why are you interested in comics?**\nI have always been in love with visual storytelling, from my very first comic, Marvel Villain Teamup Doctor Doom and Redskull. Drawing was what I did for fun.. for me.. I never really thought I could make a living at it. I was an illustrator in the Navy for 4 years where I did a few hundred training comics teaching everything and anything from folding clothes to putting out fires. I went to SCAD (Savannah College of Art and Design) and originally majored in Sequential-Art on my path to becoming a full time comic book artist UNTIL the great Will Eisner came and reviewed my portfolio.. \"Great work here, tweak this.. tweak that.. overall some really solid work here though. That aside, your going to have a hard time finding work. I see some heavy influences from Frank Miller and Barry Windsor Smith in your work but that's not mainstream.. the companies now want mainstream.\" While I should have been heartbroken.. I was actually on cloud 9.. Miller/Smith were indeed my greatest influences..but I also saw the writing on the wall. SO, I took an interactive design course, got introduced to the web... and have been doing web/UI/UX ever since (nearly 15years) .. and now it's time to get back earnestly to my original love, what I am most passionate about... comics.\n\n**What comic-related goal(s) do you have for yourself?**\nI just want to tell visual stories. My first and only goal as of today... stick with and complete this 100 day challenge. Whether that results in a fully realized strip/ comic or just a solid jumping off point. First things first.\n\n**Are there any comics that you're working on or have plans for?**\nI have a handful of ideas, like we all do... ideas are not in short supply, it's only execution that separates a good idea from an actual product. One concept that I wallowed around on for a while can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/IronMus). This idea at least would be ideally a serialized comic (which is why I've not managed to go much further - the idea of a serialized comic is just OVERWHELMING to me ..) \n\nSo.. again, hello everyone I am looking forward to participating in this challenge and seeing some cool work. BTW- Feel free to hit me up if you want to bounce ideas off someone.. etc.","subreddit_id":"t5_32fx0","subreddit":"100DayComicChallenge"}

They like the idea of signing writers who can bring with them a sizable built-in audience\n\nFruk them. \"... can bring them a sizable built-in audience.' IF you have that, you have no need for them. That is some 1990's thinking... of course they want you to come in with a built-in audience.. means they don't have to do anything. I certainly understand a publisher wanting some sort of assurances about audience numbers, but an agent. \n\nI personally cannot stand most social media. It's almost all self promotional shite... but that said.. I will use it to self promote my comic. :) It's the nature of the beast now, and it sure as hell is better than dealing with an 'literary agent' that wants me to bring them the audience.","subreddit_id":"t5_32fx0","subreddit":"100DayComicChallenge"}

{"body":"As, what I am guessing is a safe bet in saying the oldest one here... I will share a couple tid bits with you.. and let you decide because honestly only you can make the decision as to whether or not your a good person.\n\n**Bill Cosby Quote:** I don't know the key to success, but the key to failure is trying to please everybody.\n\n\nI don't know about anyone else, but I am FASCINATED by the South Park guys. The South Park movie is still the funniest, most brilliant satire I have ever seen. What are the odds they give 1 fuck whether people think they are 'bad people'? I can assure you.. zero fuks given. \n\n\nAnother Seth McFarlane, creator of Family Guy.. zero fuks. \n\n\nLast one, a little closer to our project here.. [Mathew Inman - Creator of The Oatmeal](http://www.wired.com/2013/05/ul_readoatmeal/all/) \n\n\nEvery year, I draw my Christmas cards.. and trust me.. your strip there, that got this person to call you a 'bad person'  .. would probably shit themselves. Just as an example.. around 2005 I think.. my card had a picture of 'Santa' next to a picture of Osama-Bin-Laden .. \"Funny hat, beard, recluse...\"  well you get the idea. One year, I had 'white powder' snow men .. Anthrax or snow? .. Some people like it.. some not so much.. in either case, not my baggage or problem. \n\nThis person, and really any people, that jump to critiquing you as a person based on your creation are clearly disconnected, and need perspective. I don't know you as a person at all beyond our interactions here, and your strips. Now, you could be doing your strip, walking away, smacking some kids around, tossing some kittens into a plastic bag and throwing it in a river, then doing some lines of coke off a dead hookers ass ... but, based on what little I do know about you.. I am guessing that's not the case. There is a LOT of ugly in this world, a comic strip/ animated show etc. is NOT even close to any of that.. let alone it's creators... and there is some FILTHY shit out there.\n\nIf your happy with your creation, be proud of it and don't worry what someone might think of you as a person. If you know your a good person, and the people important to you know your a good person ... then.. zero fucks. \n\nHope this helps you. ","subreddit_id":"t5_32fx0","subreddit":"100DayComicChallenge"}

{"body":"Well, I've watched a few different videos now on the 100 day Comic challenge. Along with that, I know I am not the only one, in fact.. just about every human has this problem. When confronted with a large 'challenge' there is an overwhelming fear of getting started, or dread of where to start. Our brains are actually wired to resist these 'big' tasks. Granted breaking it down to \"30 minutes a day\" is certainly a start.. you are still setting yourself up for \"failure\" from just being overwhelmed.\n\nA couple GREAT books on this subject:\n[The Spirit of Kaizen](http://www.amazon.com/The-Spirit-Kaizen-Creating-Excellence/dp/0071796177/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1404751965&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+spirit+of+kaizen)\n[The War of Art](http://www.amazon.com/The-War-Art-Through-Creative/dp/1936891026/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1404752071&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+war+of+art) \n\nI mean, I've already bogged down into where to begin.. what to do.. and I haven't even committed to participating.\n\nSo what I would suggest, so that everyone can still work at their own pace, be productive and make visible progress.\n\n**Week 1:** (at the end of the week you should have these items completed - ideally each one you will spend at least 30min a day on - more if you can/ need to)\n- Main Character(s) Concept sketches\n- Main Character(s) Concept finalize/ polish\n- Rough Outline story Arc (est. page count)\n- Refine outline for first few pages (Taking this from the Kevin Cross vid where one day was 4 pages written) \n- There's certainly more that can be added.. but just tossing out some ideas...\n\n**Week 2:** Another set of 30+ min tasks..\n\nThis way, there are clearly defined goals and deliverables that we KNOW we have to deliver daily/weekly.\n\nAs to the google cal.

Some of my character's families are involved in a dangerous cult and I haven't figured out how 'dangerous' it is yet. I only have a rough idea but it needs to be more than 'hahaha, we're mysterious and we do bad things sometimes'. It's getting somewhere, though. Along with that, some of my characters also have supernatural powers, so I wrote tons and tons of paragraphs about every little detail, background, limitation, and side effect for their powers. It's fun.\n\nAlso started thumbnailing some cover ideas. Those are also in the link above.\n\nAs for my film, tried to clean up some storyboards.

The coolest thing about it is the scheduling and sort of .. navigation .. but either of those are already built into wordpress. The other significant factor for not bothering with comicpress, etc. at least for now, they aren't responsive.

{"body":"I'm Jess.  I'm a cranky dried up old woods witch who has somehow found her way out of the mountains and into the flatlands.  I board game and video game and read and cook and draw.  I tend towards the weird in my literature and gaming choices and my storytelling sometimes reflects that.  I am a terrible procrastinator.\n\nI'm one of those people who has been drawing since I was old enough to pick up a crayon and telling stories longer than that.  Comics seem like the perfect mixture of the two.  I probably haven't had as much traditional print comic influence as most people here.  I started out in fine arts and made my way into visual storytelling over the protests of my \"art is art, graphic design isn't\" teachers in college.  Sometimes I still find myself in the peculiar position of not quite falling precisely into any specific cubbyhole.  (Where do you draw the line between 'comic' and 'illustration'?)  I guess I also love webcomics in particular because it's a medium that really feels like it sidesteps all the \"draw this because it'll sell\" and the strict \"this is a comic, this isn't\" of a lot of print storytelling media.\n\nI have a number of comic type stories I've tried to put down on paper over the years.  Two fairly serious, as in long scripts and multiple chapters thumbnailed at least.  Four or five little more than outlines.  Dozens of 10 pages or less stories.  My terrible procrastination problem and easy distraction threshold mean I have yet to actually *finish* anything, even if I have lots of script.  \n\nToday's plan: Dig through a heap of concepts and half-finished scripts and make a plan. lol  I'd also like to do some actual work on at least one of my large projects, but I'll have to see how much time I spend sifting chaff before I make any actual promises on that.  I'll edit in my progress when I'm done.  \n\nToday's result: Project picked.  Pages sorted.  Several panels inked.  \n\nSome self-reflection forced by going through my old projects: I could probably make a timeline of my projects based solely around how the characters in them are dressed.  Mandarin collars = project started ~20 years ago. lol","subreddit_id":"t5_32fx0","subreddit":"100DayComicChallenge"}

{"body":"Howdy all,\n\n\nWhy are you interested in comics?\n\nI love the art, and the stories.  My first comics came from the grocery store by my house when I was 7 or so. Captain Carrot and Thor were my favorites.  I loved any comic with a dystopian view of the world. Rocket Raccoon, Electric Warrior, stuff like that.  I loved TMNT when that came out, and all the copy cats (Adolescent Radioactive Blackbelt Hamsters, Pre-Teen Dirty Gene Kung Fu Kangaroos, etc.) and then just kinda stuck with animal comics. Boris the Bear, Cerebus, Usagi Yojimbo, etc.\n\n\nWhat comic-related goal(s) do you have for yourself?\n\nI had a friend who liked to draw, and we used to make and trade comics all the time in school.  Ever since I started working, I almost never take time to draw like I used to, even though it's something I really enjoy.\nI've fantasized quite a few times about getting back into it, starting a web comic, or something.  This is the perfect excuse to get me off my butt and make something.  My goal is simply to spend 30 minutes a day working on making comics.  I expect at the end of 100 days to be able to look back and say, \"hey! I actually made something!\" Aaand hopefully improve on my drawing skills and habits along the way.\n\n\nAre there any comics that you're working on or have plans for?\n\nNo plans, no idea.  My first impulse was to do a 3-panel comic strip version of The Dresden Files, but with anthropomorphic mice. :-/  I don't really trust myself to write a good script, but I thought maybe I'd adapt an existing story into something weird.\n\n( -_-) (o_O ) | ( -\\_~~o~~) (-_- ) | ( -_-) (o_O )\n---|---|---","subreddit_id":"t5_32fx0","subreddit":"100DayComicChallenge"}

{"body":"I'll second this opinion as well. When I first saw you post for critiques yesterday, I decided to go the golden rule route \"If you don't have anything nice to say...\"\n\nHonestly my first thought was 'subversive superhero' comic? Yeah... we need one of those because Kick-Ass, Wolverine, Batman, The Punisher, Gambit, on and on and on.. they are called the anti-hero and are as old as storytelling. \n\nThat said, the abusive father is IMO a unique angle that you should explore more. \n\nI would STRONGLY urge you to read up on the [Monomyth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey) It's also known as \"the heroes journey\". Essentially (many theorize) that all great stories follow pretty much this very same 'journey'. There are some really great online resources that show how Frodo, Neo, Luke Skywalker, Harry Potter, Perseus etc. follow the 'heroes journey'  Your character killing, would fit nicely into the \"Crossing the Threshold\" step.\n\nLastly, at least for myself, I particularly love reading authors that KNOW their world inside and out. Fascinating story (to me anyway), J.K Rowling has names, occupations and locations for every kid at Hogwarts during Harry's time there. Most of which NEVER get mentioned in any single book. Granted... not every writer does this.. some.. make it up as they go along and it works quite well for them.\n\nGood luck, and feel free to hit  me up if you want any feedback etc.\n","subreddit_id":"t5_32fx0","subreddit":"100DayComicChallenge"}

Anyways...\n\nFor my comic, I mostly worked on editing and writing my script after receiving critiques from comic_crits. It's getting somewhere and I'm happier with it. I also worked on character designs (more like doodled, but whatever). I also made my character's schedules for fun (but it's also helpful too, since I can plan plot stuff around their time). [You can view all of the pictures here.](http://imgur.com/a/5LOgh#0)\n\nAs for my film\u2026I scribbled down REALLY bad storyboards last night to get mind going.

Later I'd read Calvin and Hobbes, but credit shall go to the one that got me interested.\n\nThe other would be \"Tintin\" which my father would read to me when I was younger.  I believe I still appreciate the styles.\n\nAs I try this challenge, \"Death Note\" often comes to mind.  I believe it has the most influence on what I'm doing now given it is becoming a detective versus murderer story told from the perspective of the one who committed the crime.\n\nThe previous panel field with mental thoughts as background text reminds me of a panel in \"Les Demons D'Alexia\" where the protagonist is inflicted with the powers of witchcraft (sort of melding of a second mind and the swirling memories were words - or so that's how I interpreted it)\n\nMore recently, I've read Zombillenium - which I love how the events seem to naturally flow between panels.  It also includes a sense of whackiness that I enjoy.  In the same vein, I have read the older \"Les adventures de Spirou\" just for the overall silliness.\n\nI realize I won't be able to come close to what can be found in the comics mentioned above, but that gives a general idea of where I'm pulling from (Japanese comics, Franco-Belgian comics, and American comic strips...)","subreddit_id":"t5_32fx0","subreddit":"100DayComicChallenge"}

{"body":"Understanding Comics is one of my favorites! If you lurk around tumblr, there are a ton of great comic resources too. I need to go through my bookmarks/likes to see what I can link here.\n\nAlso, I recommend stepping outside of comics and study film making + cinematography as well. It's very important to understand different shots so you can avoid breaking the 180 rule and 'talking heads' (basically, abusing MCU shots of the characters panel-to-panel), along with other stuff. \n\nUnderstanding what makes good composition, shot, transition, etc is super important since it can make help make or break your comic. It's a visual medium and you don't want to confuse your audience...so, most likely, you probably wouldn't use a dutch angle/tilt in a very mundane and lighthearted scene, for example.\n\nOf course, you can always break the rules (BUT you need to understand the rules and the concepts first). Being that The Shining is a horror film, [it breaks the 180 rule to help build an eerie mood.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpf-IMqxjVI) Breaking the 180 rule can also help build tension, disorientate the audience, and so on - but again, it depends on when and why (even how) you break it, because even if that is your intention, it's still easy to just flat out confuse your audience instead.\n\nHmm, that's about it for now.

Though the trouble with that is if someone decides to quit, you need to reform the mini-group.\n\nWait, how about this: same idea, but instead of 3 person mini-group, you can make 2 person agreements to hold each other accountable, and it's recommended that you make such an agreement with at least 2 other people. That way, if you lose a person, it's much easier to find another. You could add more terms to your agreement if desired (weekly feedback on each others art, for example).\n\nWhat does everyone think about that idea?","subreddit_id":"t5_32fx0","subreddit":"100DayComicChallenge"}

The actress (Idina Manzel) and John Lassiter, along with basically everyone involved was really not 'feeling' Elsa. After a day or so of brainstorming.. looking for the 'heart' of the film.. someone suggested 'make them sisters'. They had the EUREKA moment, and went back and re-wrote the film... with them as sisters.\n\n* Still 'blue-pointy haired' they now had 'heart' for the story.. but they were still struggling with Elsa's 'motivation' ... Now, they were supposedly 3/4 of the way to a finished product when the song writers wrote \"Let it go\" .. they felt they NAILED it.. so attached it to a cinematic and presented it to the team.  As John Lassiter says.. \"Oh no. We have to start over again.\" SO, they did. They now had the 'heart' of the film.. the characters people would care about.. and.. well.. if you've seen \"Frozen\" you know what I am talking about.\n\n**Moral of this**\nDisney spent over 17 years (including the original animators some 50+ years ago) .. developing their little animated movie. They were damn near completed.. and were willing to stop, rework, and push forward again.\n\nThere is a fine line between doing this forever and never having a product out. You can't spend forever trying to make it perfect, but don't be SO attached you can't let go of the bad ideas.","subreddit_id":"t5_32fx0","subreddit":"100DayComicChallenge"}

Nyos is a deep [lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake) high on the flank of an inactive [volcano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano) in the [Oku volcanic plain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oku_volcanic_plain) along the [Cameroon line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameroon_line) of volcanic activity. A [volcanic dam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_dam) impounds the lake waters.\n\n&gt;A pocket of [magma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma) lies beneath the lake and leaks [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide) (CO2) into the water, changing it into [carbonic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonic_acid). Nyos is one of only three known [exploding lakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limnic_eruption) to be saturated with carbon dioxide in this way, the others being [Lake Monoun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Monoun), also in Cameroon, and [Lake Kivu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Kivu) in [Democratic Republic of Congo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_Congo). On August 21, 1986, possibly as the result of a landslide, Lake Nyos suddenly emitted a large cloud of CO2, which [suffocated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asphyxia) 1,700\u00a0people and 3,500 livestock in nearby towns and villages.   Though not completely unprecedented, it was the first known large-scale asphyxiation caused by a natural event. To prevent a recurrence, a degassing tube that siphons water from the bottom layers of water to the top allowing the carbon dioxide to leak in safe quantities was installed in 2001, and two additional tubes were installed in 2011.\n\n&gt;Today, the lake also poses a threat because its natural wall is weakening. A geological tremor could cause this natural [lev\u00e9e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levee) to give way, allowing water to rush into downstream villages all the way into [Nigeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria) and allowing much carbon dioxide to escape.\n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/yoUdwBP.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Nyos_Lake.jpg)\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Limnic ^eruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limnic_eruption) ^| [^Lake ^Monoun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Monoun) ^| [^Mount ^Cameroon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Cameroon) ^| [^Lake ^Kivu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Kivu) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+ciw4c6j) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+ciw4c6j)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)","subreddit_id":"t5_32fx0","subreddit":"100DayComicChallenge"}

{"body":"As for pens, I have experimented quite a bit.  Just brush pens?  Then here is what I've found so far:\n\nI'm currently using a Pentel refillable brush pen.  I'm surprised how much abuse that pen has gone through and still works wonderfully.  Taking my time I can do hatching as well as broad strokes with it.  I'm progressing on a nice pin-up of what can be done with just that pen.  Will post to /r/idap or /r/drawing next week probably.\n\nIf you have marker paper or Bristol, Sakura brush pens should be good.  They used to always wear out on me (the tip splaying) when used on sketch paper.  I'm assuming it's the porous surface that was damaging the pens.  Either way, damaged pens I kept to do broad strokes, and as the ink dried out I used them for shading.  This is what I could get out of them: [Brush Pen Combo of good and worn out pens](http://mifortin.deviantart.com/art/45-minute-Old-Port-376766635)\n\nAnother option is the Copic markers with brush tips.  I found the tip to be resistant to abuse - but you'll want to use them on marker paper as it will go through the paper.  The tip is also much thicker. I like these since they can be refilled like the Pentel.  [Example with a copic sketch marker](http://mifortin.deviantart.com/art/PVM-397475519).\n\nI agree - continual practice helps improve skills.  :)","subreddit_id":"t5_32fx0","subreddit":"100DayComicChallenge"}

Maybe once you flesh it out, it will probably become understandable, but it doesn't seem all that interesting for now. Dig into his backstory (home life, school life, etc). Is he doing this for retribution? Does he see the world as black-and-white? Maybe he feels like he's in the right, even though he's wrong?\n\nI mean, I don't know anything about your protag aside from the information you gave.

{"body":"Rorschach did come to mind when I was reading the synopsis. My own suggestion would be just to explore the reason and feelings behind a \"need for violence\". I'm very fond of my psychopathic character for another story that I'm working on the side, and his motive on violence is based on the fact that he has trouble feeling and comprehending emotions on the same level as normal people do. He feels 'numb', but the brief rush of adrenaline he gets from high-risk and high-danger scenarios, makes life so bright for him for just a few moments. It's just about compared to sex, (even if he himself finds sex itself repulsive.)\n\n\nPerhaps look into bully psychology? Seeing as he doesn't want to actually kill anyone, it could be a drive for power and control. \"Proving\" that he can take matters in his own hands, and gain power through force. There's a thrill in being able to manipulate and control others. Abusive partners also come to mind, so one could probably look into the psychology mindset of abusers.\n\n\nThat's just my quick thoughts on the matter though; I'm terribly fond of villain protagonists.

I'm a bit esoteric in my formatting until I have something solid to work with. Also, gods I hate organizing panel borders.\n\n\nI'm planning to post a comic a day, and have most of the script started. Hopefully I can keep this up.\n\n\n**Why are you interested in comics?**\nLong story short, I grew up on comics. I was raised with comics around me. Given shitty hearing, but remarkable visual skills, comics became logical to me. I love the art, the stories, and I didn't have much patience for reading entire books at a time. Comics are just something that rings to me in a very important way, and conveys storytelling in a way words alone can't always accomplish in as quick of time. It recently came to my attention that my passion really does lie with making comics, so I'm pouring my time and energy into that.\n\n\n**What comic-related goal(s) do you have for yourself?** \nRight now, I want to get in the rhythm of producing work regularly. I'm nearly done making my first \"crash course\" into comics on another side-project, and I'm planning to soon start a really ambitious fantasy-comic project. Before that, however, I feel like I should get this one story out of my mind before I can move on to the really-complicated story. This is my warm up part B, basically.\n\n\n**Are there any comics that you're working on or have plans for?**\nFor now, it's a secret!\n","subreddit_id":"t5_32fx0","subreddit":"100DayComicChallenge"}

And I challenge your friends to figure out it's completely SUGAR FREE :)\n\n**Crust**\n\n* 1 cup almond flour\n* 4 tbsp unsalted butter (melted)\n* 1/4 tsp liquid splenda (or 24 packets, equivalent to 1 cup of sugar)\n\n**I added to this** 3 tablespoons baking cocoa powder and 1/4 tsp liquid splenda for the chocolate crust (which is equivalent to a square of baking chocolate)\n\n**Filling**\n\n* 2 (8 oz.) Packages Plain Cream Cheese\n* 1 8oz package Mascarpone cheese (I used this instead of ricotta)\n* 3 eggs\n* 1 teaspoon vanilla\n* 1/4 tsp liquid splenda (or 24 packets, equivalent to 1 cup of sugar)\n* 1 teaspoon lemon juice\n\n**Procedure**\n\n1. Preheat oven to 350\n2. Melt the butter in the microwave\n3. Stir in cocoa powder and add all the splenda for the crust (1/2 tsp total)\n4. Pour this into the almond meal and blend until distributed; You'll get a very lumpy crust-texture :)\n5. Press this into a springform pan or 9x9 baking dish (well greased)\n6. Bake for 20 minutes.\n\n*MEANWHILE*\n\n7. Place cream cheese and mascarpone in the bowl of mixer or food processor and blend together at medium speed.\n8. Add eggs one at a time\n9. Continue to beat at medium high speed until incorporated and getting kind of fluffy\n10. Add lemon juice and vanilla\n11. Beat for 30 more seconds\n12. Chill until the crust is ready\n\n*BACK TO THE CRUST*\n\n13. Once the crust has pre-baked, take it out of the oven and let it cool for at least 30 minutes.\n14. Preheat your oven to 425\n15. Once the crust has cooled, layer the cream cheese mixture on top of the crust and place in the oven. Turn the oven down to 300 immediately.\n(You can optionally at this point use a water bath: place the cheesecake pan in a larger container and add boiling water then place the whole thing in the oven - I didn't do this.)\n16. Bake for 60 minutes, or until toothpick in middle of cake comes out clean.\n17. Let cool completely before serving!\n\nYou can optionally omit the added baking chocolate and additional sweetener for a plain crust.\n\nAs I made it, it will have 9 servings:\n\n* 447 calories each\n* 43g fat\n* 7g carb\n* 3g fiber\n* 4 net carbs","subreddit_id":"t5_34au7","subreddit":"100DaysofKeto"}

And I can't tell for certain because there's a lot of quick calories added, but it doesn't look like you're staying under your net carbs, I know the carbs in chili can really add up.  (Oh and the sugar substitutes I was talking about were sugar alcohols, I'm not sure what death brownies are but usually low carb brownies have sugar alcohols).  You really do have to go at least a week or so with no \"cheats\" to get out of the sugar craving mess, and make sure you're other nutrients are doing well.  My diet is more meat heavy then even I would like, but I'm generally doing really well on all my nutrients and I supplement if I'm missing or low on something, potassium was the one I was lowest in at the start but I used NuSalt and now I'm fine.  \n\nAt the end of the day is this diet isn't making you happy, just stop, stop now.  Do what you did before, work hard on it, if it works congratulations and lucky you!  If not, hit us back in a few months and try again.  Because the trick is, if you're not ready to give it your all it in no way will work for you, the same as any lifestyle change.  I mean, if you hate treadmills you aren't going to lose weight and keep it off by walking on a treadmill, try an elliptical.  I wish I could eat an apple sometimes, and I love apple cider, but my allergies actually increase to include both of those two years ago, this diet is already reducing those issues for me and at some point I will probably reintroduce them back in, in moderation, good luck, and no matter what, stick with something because the end goal is worth it!!!

Some actors are fat and that's okay because that's who they are and it's natural. It isn't who you are, and the audience reacts to that. You are self conscious and you don't take the risks you would take if you were comfortable in your own skin, you aren't comfortable with how you look on camera and how the audience perceives you, and no matter how good you are- it shows. You don't want to be seen and if you don't want to be seen people won't want to watch you. \n\nWhat kind of roles do you really want? What do you need to feel and look like to be the best you that you can be? That's what you need to work on being, so you only think about the work and not all that other crap.\"\n\nI pretty much cried for two straight days because I thought I could trick people into thinking I was someone like Melissa McCarthy or Rebel Wilson when that's just not who I am.

Just this morning, I made him the Chinese pork and tofu dish he wanted, but I only had a small bowl (without adding the cornstarch). So I struggle on. Even if I wind up not losing much this round, I think this 100 Days of Keto is very important for me in combating \"Holiday fever,\" which in the past has been my downfall.

I've been tracking everything with MFP, shooting for 25g carbs a day. Basically 5% carbs, 65-70% fat, 25-30% protein. I've always been relatively low-carb, the biggest change has been dropping my protein. I've always done a bit of a bro science diet that had a ton of protein but I've read the body can treat excess protein like its carbs (not sure on source).  So far keto seems to keep me full and has dropped my total calorie consumption so, while I'm eating rich, full-fat foods, I'm still operating at a deficit.  I need to do a better job getting some greens and fiber!!!\n\n\nI'm also 4 weeks into a training plan for a half-marathon in March.

Keto is simple, keep it simple - real food - meat, vegetables, oils, butter, nuts, cheese, cream, eggs, avocado.  Eat as you otherwise would just minus the carbs, try not to think about it as something particularly special but focus on the basics - roasted chicken and asparagus, steak and spinach, stir fry, taco or fajita salad, chicken cordon bleu with broccoli, scrambled eggs, omelet, frittata, quiche, green salad with chicken or steak and dressing.  Here's a thread with lots of great [meal ideas](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/o6vei/here_it_is_the_unofficial_tell_me_what_to_eat/).  Here are a few meal plans: [6 day meal plan](http://goo.gl/IdZ4A), [30 day meal plan](http://www.ruled.me/30-day-ketogenic-diet-plan/), [other menu plans](http://www.ibreatheimhungry.com/keto-menu-plans).  Also check out Cavemanketo.com for casserole ideas that you can make ahead and eat all week.  The crock pot is great - chili, pulled pork, salsa verde chicken, soup.  \n\n4.  Yup. Check out /r/ketogains. It takes time to adjust to exercise on keto, up to 8-12 weeks. It might be rough but if you give it time you will likely find that you feel like you can run for miles and miles and miles.  Water and electrolytes are critical, especially sodium (1 to 2 grams extra in addition to the general recommendations). MCT oil and caffeine can help.  You need time not necessarily calories.  But eat as you normally would before running and give yourself time to adapt. Once you are adapted you'll be a fat burning fuel machine. \n\n5.  Others can help with this as I don't eat dessert but IMO you can part with dessert and the fact that you think you can't might be more reason to do so.

{"body":"Weekends are my downfall. I do well during the week, I'm not tempted and feeling full of energy.  I was a bit high on calories this weekend, but I find aiming for 1200 average over the week makes this work out. I successfully managed a girlfriends birthday party with dinner at a pub. A bit of tequila, some wine, and a few small bites of decadent chocolate cake. I'm of the lucky ones that can have a small bit of carbs and not have it induce cravings. \n\nOne tip that helps me is acknowledging that weekends are two meal days only. We are up before 6 everyday of the week so we sleep in on weekends. With keto (I'm the only one eating keto officially, but as I do 90% of the cooking, he basically gets keto dinner and breakfast) we're not starving right away, so I make breakfast (after coffee and tea of course) around 11. Then normal dinner around 6-7. It allows me to have more elaborate meals on weekends (I LOVE to cook) and still keep macros and calories in check. \n\nI'm actually experimenting with not eating in the morning. 2 tbsp. Cream in my tea, but it's 11.30 here, and I'm just starting to get hungry. Lunch (spaghetti squash and meat sauce) is in 15 minutes though. (Since back on keto, realized what I thought was a love of pasta was just a love of pasta sauce. Just as good without the blah pasta.)\n\nI measured my waist yesterday and I'm just shy of 30\". *fist pump* it's been awhile.... ;)\n\nSat down with SO and watched Cereal Killers last night.

I may blow my calories for the day with meats, but that is all I anticipate. \n\nThe thing is, I seem to have lost all craving for carb rich items. I think about it sometimes, maybe eating some cookies when I meet my goals, but there is no desire there. Almost just seems like I would do it because I \"can\" instead of me wanting to eat it, if that makes sense. My husband brags about how I was such a foodie, and now I have zero trouble abstaining. Yesterday I was filling a stocking for him that is chock full of some of my favorites, and was not tempted to eat a single butterfinger bell, or reese's tree. They didn't even register that they were something I \"could\" eat (as in them physically being food for me put in my mouth, not saying they are keto lol). I brought him a few of the ones that wouldn't fit in his stocking, and he asked if I was tempted. That was when I realized that these brightly colored foil things in my hand were pieces of food that I had enjoyed in excess a scant 40 something days ago.\n\n Instead of thinking about what I will do after I reach my goals, I am just going to focus on my success and how well I feel, though I am a bit bummed that the weight loss hasn't helped with my back pain any. However, I have panic disorder, and it is kind of amazing that things that would have normally caused me anxiety are barely registering on the anxiety meter. I am not sure if this has anything to do with the diet, or just that I am happy I am losing weight and in a better mood.\n\nOh, and the goals we had for day 100...I wanted to be able to fit into a pair of jeans my husband liked for his birthday (which is day 100). I am wearing those jeans right now, lol. They are 2 sizes smaller than the ones I started this journey on, and still a little bit tight, but aren't uncomfortable.

{"body":"&gt; I have averaged a 41.4% calorie deficit during the last 14 days.\n\nOkay, first things first. Step back, breathe, relax. Keto is not about a deficit. It's about getting your macros, getting used to the rhythm of things (in your case, meal planning might be a goal to set).\n\nKeto doesn't really work like other calories in / calories out methods.\n\nMore than likely, you're hungry because you're starving your body.\n\nTry eating at a 20% deficit instead. You should feel better and be able to do everything you need to do in a more relaxed manner. Personally, I can't *think straight* if I'm hungry.\n\nUnless you have TONS of weight to lose, 40% is a lot of stress on your body and your brain and it isn't going to get you any sort of results any faster than a smaller deficit to begin with.\n\nAlso, what's your definition of \"more weight?\" The first week you can expect to see 8-10 pounds of which is mostly water weight. If you're a woman, weight loss is going to be considerably slower after that, especially if you don't have that much to lose.\n\nBut seriously, stressing out your body with a serious deficit is just going to make you cranky and you won't lose weight any faster.","subreddit_id":"t5_34au7","subreddit":"100DaysofKeto"}

Or at least give us an idea of what you are eating on a daily basis.\n\n1200 calories is pretty low, and I know that my body feels terrible and won't let go of any fat if I really skimp on calories.\n\nFirstly, are you drinking enough water? Try to drink at least 64 oz a day, if not more. That will help flush out your system.\n\nSecondly, are you getting enough electrolytes? Avocados are both a great source of potassium and fat. Add salt to everything you eat, and use lite-salt if you're worried about potassium problems (as on keto you can't just eat a banana).\n\nThirdly, are you eating enough fat? Without carbs, your body resorts to burning fat. You have to \"train\" it to use your own fat on your body by feeding it fat. Avocados, salmon, eggs (with the yolks!), bacon - these are all very good high fat foods.\n\nFinally, what is \"a significant amount of weight\" for you? Everyone is different. Unfortunately men lose much faster than women, so you'll see posts where men have lost 20-30 pounds in a month and that just *isn't* realistic for women, which sucks.

Moreover, they eventually turn negative and stay that way even though you're in ketosis. Lastly, you can be out of ketosis and they can be positive. Other than the first week they are not useful.

{"body":"I'm a little confused about the balanced diet statement, but I'm going to assume you meant standard american diet.  I'm a firm believer that there is no diet that works for everyone, while Keto and adkins diets work best for most people with high insulin sensitivity, that doesn't mean it works for everyone.  That being said, I can't lose weight on the typical Keto diet either, I had to modify it.  I also have PCOS and IBS plus lots of allergies (all tied into your adrenal gland, same gland that regulates your insulin).  I had to cut out all FODMAP's, especially lactose.  Also, no \"sugar free\" options, those sugar alcohols make me gain weight and crave more and more sugar and sweets, I even had to cut alcohol and caffeine.  It may sound extreme, but with allergies they actually suggest an elimination diet for a few months and then start adding back in slowly.  I even have to limit my veggies since they give me gas and bloating, aka signs of a food intolerance or allergy.  If you're just starting your third week, modify what your eating, especially try to limit \"alternate\" foods like quest bars and low carb replacement foods like ice cream and things.  Heck, even try going lactose free for a few days see if that helps (it's estimated 75% of the world is at least partially lactose intolerant as adults).  If all that doesn't work for you then go to what worked for you in the past and do it again.  Heck for me, because of my PCOS, if I try to do higher intensity cardio which raises your stress levels and testosterone, I will gain weight not lose it (This has even happened while I was under a nutrionist and fitness coaches care).\n\nDo what works best for you.

{"body":"Don't kill yourself with the exercise. \n-------------\n&gt;Exercise is a wellness tool. It is not a weight loss tool.\n&gt;\n&gt;Most people feel better and function better if they get a modest amount of regular exercise. On average across the population, thin people get more exercise than heavy people. People who exercise regularly across a lifetime live longer. But the extrapolation of these observations \u2013 that if heavy people exercised a lot more they\u2019d be thin and live longer \u2013 is not supported by science. Nonetheless, that is the message that many health care professionals and the media consistently communicate to heavy people.\n&gt;\n&gt;Here are some basic (but often ignored) facts. Fitness is primarily an inherited trait. Training can increase aerobic power at most by 10-20%, but (figuratively speaking) a different choice of parents would increase or decrease your fitness by as much as 50%. It takes about 350 miles of running or 1000 miles of cycling to burn off 10 pounds of body fat (assuming that your appetite doesn\u2019t increase or your metabolism slows down). Unfortunately, when heavy people exercise regularly, their resting metabolism slows \u2013 this is not a typo! \u2013 it SLOWS by 5 to 15% on average. Based on the results of 4 tightly controlled, inpatient human studies, instead of losing 10 pounds, the average person loses 7 pounds with this much exercise, and some people lose as little as 2 or 3. These studies specifically demonstrated that this less-than-expected weight loss was attributable to the observed reduction in resting metabolic rate.\n&gt;\n&gt;Exercise done by heavy people causes a lot of collateral damage. Think ankles, knees, hips, and low backs. So here\u2019s a radical idea: let heavy people try carbohydrate restriction first, lose some weight (which most do without resorting to exercise), and then let them decide when to become more active once they are empowered, energized, and lighter of foot.\n-------------\nKeep to the diet. Exercise to feel better and gain flexibility, but don't sweat not beating yourself to death in the gym.\n\n(I know this is a very unpopular opinion, but so was the whole LCHF diet at one time.)","subreddit_id":"t5_34au7","subreddit":"100DaysofKeto"}

Anyway, when the meal came, the salad was there but so were the chips.  :O\n\nSo I did the only reasonable thing anyone could expect of me...\n\n...I gave them to my friend.  :D  \n\nSo, not a great wobble, but not a disaster either.

{"body":"Yup, sounds about right (I know how the system operates :).  So now let's do this with more thought and logic - start with 20% deficit, and no higher than 30% deficit.  To lose weight you just need to eat slightly less than you need. Your body is usually more willing to cooperate and let the weight go if you keep the deficit reasonable, at high deficits it often starts working against you and moreover it's often why people fall off the wagon - over time the high deficit the body starts sending signals - cravings, etc that just make it more difficult.  Yea, your appetite will regulate somewhat so if you undereat one day often you're more hungry the next day but you don't want to have too many drastically undereating days such that the hungrier days don't balance and you're overall just undereating.  Easy ways to add calories - choose fattier meat, toss 1 T oil or butter when cooking (adds calories quickly with no added volume), avocado (quick 250 calories), serving of cheese 110 calories.

The coated chicken breasts were then fried in pork fat.  Made a sauce with 50g of butter, 50g grated cheese and 50g heavy/double cream, seasoned with mustard, salt and pepper.

{"body":"Weighing is a real psychological issue, I think.\n\nOn my initial keto run, I weighed religiously and I was in a great mindset, so I just ignored the ups and downs that dehydration, shark week, a big meal etc can cause - and I quite enjoyed watching the ebbs, flows and plateaus.  \n\nIt was particularly insightful as I went through a month where I didn't lose a pound, but went down an entire jeans size - so I learnt a lot about the pros and cons of the scale.  (You hear other people saying it, but there's nothing as powerful as seeing it for yourself).\n\nThis time, I don't think I've been as strong psychologically, and that's mostly because I was the heaviest I'd ever been when I started this journey.  For me, personally, I would say that I am overweight at 160lbs, average at 150lbs, slim at 140lbs.  ...so when I lost 10lbs in my first run at keto, it was brilliant going from one 'category' to the next, and fitting in different clothes etc.  \n\nAs I'm still a bit overweight, losing 10lbs doesn't mean that I can fit in my smaller wardrobe; I'm still working my way back down to that first overweight category!  For the first time, I genuinely felt that everything was a bit hopeless and I struggled to see my achievements.  I was very much in a, \"Well, you lost 10lbs but you're STILL FAT,\" mindset - and then if you add minute or non-existent weightlosses to that, I could see disaster ahead.\n\nThis was a long rattle on about why I am not currently weighing, but it is genuinely a relief.  I will weigh at the end of the 100 days challenge, as I think that's long enough to have seen a decent result and hopefully the losses won't be hidden.  :)  ","subreddit_id":"t5_34au7","subreddit":"100DaysofKeto"}

{"body":"I'm liking the Band. I used a Body Media armband a few years ago, and since January I've been using a Fitbit One, but I've never used a wrist tracker. I tried the Misfit Shine but hated the data, interface, and overall experience.\n\nThe Band is a bit bulky, but not overly so.  I think I'd prefer a smaller width strap, but I think the hardware requires the bigger form factor. If you have a Microsoft store or kiosk in your area, you'd definitely want to check it out before buying.\n\nI'm still figuring out the connectivity between different apps- the calories sent over to MyFitnessPal are screwy, but Runkeeper got my workout information just fine.\n\nI love the heart rate monitor on the Band. I hated having to use a chest strap HRM in addition to the Fitbit. The way Fitbit tracks my activity is wonky, and I got really fed up this week when manually entering an activity didn't correct my steps and mileage. I run on a treadmill, and Fitbit thinks I've gone 2-3 times the distance that I do. I was using Endomondo and a heart rate strap to get more accurate data, but with the last software update, Fitbit isn't doing the corrections any more.\n\nI was impressed at the accuracy of the Band in tracking my distance on the treadmill. Within 1 minute of my treadmill putting me at the 1 mile mark, the Band buzzed and displayed the same info. It's the best experience I've had with a fitness tracker on the treadmill.\n\nThe guided workout feature is really cool. I did a tabata workout this morning- the band buzzes to let you know when to switch exercises or rest, and displays the current activity (Push-ups for 20 seconds or 10 seconds rest). The phone app that you use to browse the workouts has instructional videos, which was great when I totally forgot what a squat thrust was.\n\nSo far, the only negative thing has been the incorrect information on MyFitnessPal, and since the band has only been out for a day, there might just be some kinks that need to get worked out.\n\nOh, the app was easy to set up on my phone (HTC M8), and it's fairly intuitive. At this time there's no way to edit sleep logs or workouts, which should be something that can be done. Oddly, there does not seem to be a way to log daily weight. Also, you can set silent/haptic alarms on the Band itself, but not through the app, and there's no way to have them be recurring or schedule them.\n\nMy current assessment it that it's a very good fitness tracker that needs some polishing up of the software, app, and data sharing. As a smartphone accessory, it's functional and provides enough features to be useful.","subreddit_id":"t5_34au7","subreddit":"100DaysofKeto"}

You need to track for 2 or 3 months to get a baseline. I'd suggest you eat more (20% deficit) whilst doing this.

{"body":"I'm not certain how you can be in negative carbs.  You can't count added fiber to decrease carbs, only fiber that's part of the food naturally.  You've had fritos and the brownies I know both of these have carbs, aka sugar, heck even avocados have carbs.  Are you adding seasoning to your chili, if so, carbs; garlic, onion carbs.  MFP doesn't allow people to see the details of your food, just the overview, but don't entirely trust MFP either.  Some people when they add in a recipe are only concerned with calories or fat so that's all the add in, you have to make sure you're getting the full picture.  And if MFP doesn't have the full sandwich, then enter in the ingredients to get a clearer picture of what your eating, or make your own recipe in the database.  A good restaurant should be able to give you the info on the basic of their ingredients so you can set it up right (and something simple like chicken avocado you can probably just do on your own).\n\nThere are a lot of hidden carbs out there, the more detailed you are in your food diary the better off you'll be even if you do a different diet.

I am now over 72 kgs, and I hope to reach my goal weight of 68kgs at the end of 100 days.

And of course, a coconut oil BPC to start the day. I've had success with this diet in the past 6 months and commit to following the same as strictly as possible (without being an asshole to colleagues and family).\n\nThe only thing that concerns me is that I am due to travel to the Middle East soon and will need to fend for myself.

I usually make my breakfast in the deep ones, but used a shallow one this morning and it looked like So Much More.  I couldn't even finish, and took the rest to work as a mid morning snack.

Other than the amazing success stories I have seen posted on the keto boards, one reason I chose this type of eating is the ability to eat out and to negotiate holiday meals prepared by others. Where there is protein and salad (almost everywhere) there will be a way to stay true to the plan.  I have been thinking about negotiating Thanksgiving and Christmas being a guest, and also going out to restaurants a lot over the holidays.

{"body":"You're me! At least, as far as the leftover thing goes. I had horrible guilt about leftovers, to the point of anxiety and obsession. Then I read a book called \"The Beck Diet Solution\" and what the author said really rang true. For example:\n\n1. Leftovers have no feelings. They're not going to be sad or sorry if you don't eat them.  \n\n2. If you're worried about waste, consider this: you'll get extra, unneeded calories from what you eat out of guilt, which is *also* a waste.  \n\n3. Finally, *you* are more important than food. Even if you're in reduced circumstances, you're *still* worth more than a couple of spoonfuls of potatoes or beans.  \n\nSo, if he doesn't eat leftovers and you don't want to, here's a couple of ideas:\n\nMake a one-time investment in some ramekins, the ceramic or glass kind, that measure about 10 cm across. Your husband can make his shepherd's pie in those single-serving dishes and you can be free of the temptation of beans and potatoes. He won't have to eat leftovers, either: each pie or chicken dish is a new dish.\n\nStock up on keto-friendly frozen vegetables and cheeses. Cauliflower cheese is a classic--you can whip it up, and make a flour-based roux for him while you microwave your cheese over your cooked cauliflower.  \n\nAnd, not to be too mean about it, pull up your big-girl disco panties and have a serious talk with your husband. You guys are partners. You're making a change for your health, which means you'll both have to give a little on the food issue. This may be a life-change for you, but is doesn't have to be for him; he just has to relax a bit. \n\nYou are not set up for failure unless you think you are. You can do this.

{"body":"I too started for medical reasons.  I knew it would make me feel better eventually because I'd done it twice before.  I was prepared, I guess, for 2 weeks of lethargy - but it became 4 weeks.  The fact that I was losing weight without moving around was key in getting me through keto.\n\nI advise that you cut back on exercise, you stick to keto, you eat over your calorie macro - but never believe that those are longterm options.  After a month or so, you will feel much more energetic.  For me, that meant going from 800 steps a day to 2000 steps a day (and now, about 5 months in, 5000 steps a day).  \n\nI spent a lot of time thinking.  That was good.  I like sitting and watching movies/TV, so that's good.\n\nBut I was not prepared for the extra energy that came after 4 weeks.  I started C25K (and now routinely do 2-3 miles a day).  For me, that's amazing.\n\nTry drinking not so much water.  There's a big thing about lots of water while on keto (or any diet) but I am back to drinking what I always drank - not a gallon per day.  I make sure I get enough salt with that water, that's key (potassium and magnesium adjustments become natural).\n\nI ate what I always ate - minus the carbs.  And I let myself go ahead and eat beef.  ANd lots of eggs.  Menus are difficult because we're all so different.  Chia/almond milk pudding is wonderful (but I use SF syrups fairly liberally).  We eat lots of fish, beurre blanc, I eat lots of cheese, roast beef (home made).  I eat the same things almost every day for breakfast and lunch.  For dinner, it's the same as before (I still cook for carb-eating people), must minus the carbs.\n\nI don't know about trying to improve running times - endurance is fine with keto, but speed is a different matter.  I have more energy now than ever before (just finished a weekend of steep hiking...more miles than usual).\n\nI don't eat many desserts aside from almonds (cocoa flavored) with 90% or 85% chocolate.  But I do love some chocolate mousse and when too lazy to whip actual cream, I have been known to have cool whip (shame on me).

My biggest hurdle will be laziness of prepping and cooking food. I do very little in the kitchen right now, most of my food is heat from a can/frozen bag, or green smoothies. I plan to start small, with simple egg recipes... I don't even have much experience cooking raw meat. Lots of youtube cooking vids in my future. \nAnyways, good luck everyone.

If your doctor recommended it then go with it but as someone familiar with how doctors make recommendations for weight loss and the fact that he picked 1200 calories (often considered the lowest for women) he likely just picked it arbitrarily without actually considering your stats or what a good % caloric deficit would be.

{"body":"...reminded me that winter was when i had died.\n\nThis winter was not as you would typically expect. This winter was, hot, to say the least. It was hot and new years eve was soon to happe . It is probably one of my favorite times of the year, the new year celebrations. Its some of the only times I remember. I go all over town finding the best parties to crash. And they usually are the best. Well, it seems that this year, death was in the air, and one particular party had become branded in my memory as a scar that never leaves a body.\n\nIt was a quick one. The party that is. Starting at around eight in the afternoon, I show up with a few six packs as to at least not seem like a complete mooch. This guy had everything a party could wish for! He had a massive house that was open to all partygoers. He had a huge pool and jaquzzi all detailed by that fine concrete rock design that houses seem to be comming with nowadays. He even had an intricate water slide. Two of em so you could race a friend. One goes under a waterfall and the other goes through the rocks and they both exit a few feet above the pool. This guy had hired a DJ to play some stuff that no one has heard of before, some really deep underground house and techno shit, the kind you would hear at raves. But it was new and no one had heard it before. This DJ spared none of his equipment, cause he seemed to have trapped himeelf inside a castle of speakers. Not to mention there were lazer lights and spotlights dancing to the beat. Oh, and there was this bartender from spain who know just about every combination of drinks you could imagine. This was a party that put rooftop venues and skybars to shame.\n\nIt was a hot night. A good solid eighty two degrees. A perfect night for a dip in the pool and a few beers to wash down some excelent sushi from a japanese shef who arrived late.\n\nIt was eleven oclock by now, and the DJ was still keeping the crowd going. The pool wasnt tinted by beer, surprisingly, and the sushi shef had trucks bring him more supplies and ingreedients every hour. My two sixpacks were long gone to some fat guy who was now having a chugging competition with an irishman.\n\nYou know, this whole night was honestly a blur. Not much happened to me up untill the very end. Sad enough, not much happened to anybody really. They all seemed stuck in a trance like somebody being hypnotized. The party was really lonely too. I guess its now safe to say that I went to these parties looking for love. Ha, its kind of stupid really. Looking back on it now, no one ever finds that golden girl at parties. I mean sure, the six beers and a shot of vodka and you think that youve found the girl you wanna marry even though shes admitted shes a prostitute and just a cross dresser.\n\nBut I only feel worse after the parties, having come out of them loveless and alone like always. Typically after a week or so my determination picks up and I set out for more parties. Well, its all pointless now. Looking down at my life really sucks. Anyways, I got sidetracked there. Let me finish my story.\n\nSo another hour passes and the clock is about to hit midnight. Everybody is filled with extacy, the DJ mixed the music down so perfectly for the last ten seconds, that the crowd didnt know what to do! Ten seconds left till midnight, and eleven seconds left in my life. The DJ is pounding out the music so hard, that even a little bit of energy gets into me. Five seconds left till midnight and the build is cued. At this point the crowd raves. Jumping, counting, chugging drinks that arent even theirs. These people dont care. Two seconds left till midnight, and those in the pool are splashing so much that theres water everywhere. And then it happens. Somebody jumping had slipped, and began falling into the pool. The next is all slow motion. I hear the DJ shout one and the music stops. All I hear now is my heart racing. The person falling had grabbed me to try and save themselves. I couldnt grab anything in time. I begin falling as well. I now didnt hear anything. All I could feel is how dissapointed I was in myself. This was honestly the worst feeling ever. Falling and being dissapointed in my own life, never having accomplished anything. And then it happened. When people had said \"when you are about to die, your life flashes before your eyes\" I never imagined that a flashing life ment watching your death happen right before your own eyes and not being able to do anything about it. I took the perspective of someone else in the pool. Watching... watching MYSELF fall into the pool. Unfortunately I now saw that I wasnt falling directly into the pool... I was falling at an angle towards the edge of the other side of the pool. I want to stop myself, but my final thoughts are stopping me... I cant bring myself to it. Just knowing that tin my life, I regret so much and disapoint myself so much. I cant bring myself to save myself. So i watch. I watch as my skull splits open and blood spills into the pool and around the ground. Now im not anywhere. Im nowhere. I just feel it happening. I slide into the water and feel myself sink. Being pushed around. And finally, i disapear.\n\nNow were back here. As I watch a fipm reel of my life on loop. Chained in this prison. Forced to watch my life and constantly feel this deep regret and disappointment in myself. I had so many chances to find the true one I love, if only I searched in the right places. So I say to you, do not disapoint yourself. Do not regret something you could not do in your life. Because you will be stuck watching yourself make these mistakes. Instead, give yourself moments to be proud of. Moments in your life where you can proudly tell the world that YOU lived this life and YOU regret nothing. Ive made the mistake of not doing this. I was a fool, and now I pay the price.\n\nEdit: Do excuse my unclear storytelling. Im used to writing screenplays for film, not novelistic short stories (even though I do love it).","subreddit_id":"t5_30usx","subreddit":"100WordsProject"}

{"body":"The Kick-Ass 3 series is out, but has not completed its run. The last volume should be coming out mid June. At this point I only read comics when the full edition is out and I can buy a single text. That comes this fall. Hit Girl has a series that takes place between the Kick Ass and Kick Ass 2. I skipped it, but I may check out 3. Word is Mark Miller told the studio that he refuses to continue past 3. \n\nI read Hunger Games shortly after it came out in October of 2008, about a month before the 1st Twilight movie came out. Trying to ride the success of that movie, the promotion of the book switched from dystopian scifi/ young Adult Scifi to teen romance/ Scifi romance, really pushing the love triangle angle. You may remember all the Team Edward vs. Team Jacob stuff from back then with Twilight. I think there was even a Taco Bell ad campaign with collector cups. Team Peeta v. Team Gale stuff started popping up. This was when the news would do stories about teenage girls who stood in line for 24 hours to see the movie on opening night or had seen it 10 times. So in late 2008 the reaction whenever the book was bought up was, isn't that like twilight but in the future with no vampires? All 3 people I mentioned reading it to in 2008 wanted to know if I read twilight and why I was reading teenage girl romance novels. (I was in my late 20s working on my Ph.D. in a molecular biology lab at the time. These weren't high school kids with a limited appreciation of literature and genres. This is how the book was being marketed.) Critics really lashed out on the main character in the later Twilight novels series for a number of reasons, including personality weaknesses and too many personal sacrifices for her love interest. When the promotion for the 2nd and 3rd Hunger Games books begin, the push was that Katniss was nothing like the fragile love struck girl in Twilight, instead it was all girl power bad ass with a bow. (Ironically, the 2nd and 3rd book brought the flaws in her character to the forefront.) In 2014, now the 1st book is most offend compared to the Japanese novel and subsequent film Battle Royale, to the point of criticism and allegations of plagiarism. Trailer [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-T7yPJVvXw). The movies were promoted as scifi and action, with little to no attention paid to the love triangle part. Perception has changed a lot and I could probably admit to enjoying it now, but I am still stigmatized by people thinking it was a trashy teen romance novel. It is the only book I can think of where I am hesitant to tell people I read and enjoyed. You are probably right, and I should start correcting people with misconceptions of the book.","subreddit_id":"t5_2uktl","subreddit":"100movies365days"}

For example, the 2011 remake of *Footloose*, whilst awful, does not, in any way, \"ruin\" the original film. Furthermore, to my knowledge, no one has ever been forced to go and watch a movie. If you love a movie and don't want to see a modern take on it, don't go and see it. \n\nPersonally, I'm the kind of person who watches the same movie fifty times - why wouldn't I want to see a slightly different version of that same film? \n\nAnd as for people who point to the current surge of reboots and claim that Hollywood has run out of ideas - give me a break! *The Maltese Falcon* was a remake, for crying out loud, Hollywood is built on adaptations and remakes.","subreddit_id":"t5_2uktl","subreddit":"100movies365days"}

A lot of people think that this is a betrayal of Solengards character that was developed throughout the 4 hours. Bullshit - we knew nothing of the man, what goes on in his head, the audience have put way too much trust in his word. It fit perfectly in this movie, that Joe reacted this way. All throughout her life, sex was something she consented to. Every, single, time. She demanded it, no matter how we may perceived it as being her self disrespect. What Solengard did, was assume she just enjoyed sex for the sake of it, that \"if she has wings, why not fly\". But it's an assumption that he made, that since she has a vagina, why wouldn't he let her have a taste of it. Heck, she's had sex with thousands of men, of all size, age and race. Why WOULDN'T she let him have sex. Because she didn't want to, and didn't consent to it. And her one and only \"friend\" betrayed her. Boom. What a piece of shit he was, and what a great fucking ending in my opinion.

It's definitely not one of his most accessible movies and from what I can tell usually takes more than one viewing before people see it for what it is. The fact that you singled out the twist to talk about makes me think this might be you - not that there's anything wrong with talking about that aspect of the plot as it is surprising but I think once you already know the plot and can focus on the characters and themes the movie comes off better on subsequent viewings.

{"body":"This film is notable not just for being terrible, but also for how much effort to even be produced. I forget some of the details, but back when it was new the studios wanted to make a movie of *Neuromancer* by William Gibson. There was a good audience for science fiction, with the *Alien* movies and a *Terminator* sequel and of course *Jurassic Park* making lots of money and using amazing special effects. But either Gibson wouldn't cooperate or they just couldn't get a good screenplay, so Neuromancer kept getting delayed. Eventually a script for JM turned up, based on a short story in the same futuristic setting as Neuromancer, and somehow Robert Longo, a successful contemporary artist from the 80's, was interested. Longo had never directed a film in his life. So the movie got made mostly through willpower, and spent many many months getting tested and re-edited, and finally released in the version you saw.","subreddit_id":"t5_2uktl","subreddit":"100movies365days"}

So it opens by charging out of the gate with the murders and the letters and the main characters trying to piece it all together. But then the well runs dry, and the characters are just left to drive themselves over the edge. This can be directly contrasted with a movie like Se7en, where the primary thrill is seeing how the plot ends up falling into place with an impossible neatness.\n\nPeople who watch all of his movies multiple times end up gravitating toward Zodiac due to the depth and complexity it possesses, a depth and complexity he has never attempted before or since.","subreddit_id":"t5_2uktl","subreddit":"100movies365days"}

{"body":"The scene where Leatherface chases the girl from the woods, through the house and back out to the gas station is *crazy* good. It's one of the best, if not the best, horror footchases ever filmed. It feels incredibly immediate, incredibly real and frightening, like a dream where you just keep running and can't escape, but it does so without ever giving you a \"come on!\" moment where she totally should have been caught or died. It's a long scene of sustained suspense. If that were the only good part it would still be better than 90% of horror movies.  \n\nBut it isn't, and I think the non-stop screaming you describe at the end is also instrumental to the movie's success. It becomes one of those sounds, like the alarm at the end of Alien, that just constantly reminds you you are in that moment with the characters, you can't get out, and you wish you could. You feel her exasperation and vulnerability through it.  \n\nAll time great horror movie and the best slasher not called Psycho. ","subreddit_id":"t5_2uktl","subreddit":"100movies365days"}

It also suffers from a limp \"Disney death\" ending that not only makes little sense but had a reduced emotional impact from being so predictable.

{"body":"I appreciate this review and your giving the movie its fair shake. If I may, I'd like to give a perspective on the allegations of antisemitism, since this is a charge that was lobbied quite frequently when the movie was being released.  \n\nInsofar as the movie follows the Gospel accounts of the crucifixion, it doesn't really get any positive Jewish role models to work with, at least from within the power structure of the Israelite nation - the exception might be Nicodemus who doesn't really come back into the story until after Jesus' death. The specific people who conspired to put Jesus to death were political and religious leaders who were threatened by Christ's teachings and His appeal to the people they wanted to control. Jesus has very few complimentary things to say about these leaders because they have perverted God's law and used it to reap power and wealth. When the Bible uses the term \"the Jews\" in the story that is who they are referring to. It's worth noting, however obvious it might be, that Jesus was Jewish, as were his disciples, Mary and Martha, etc.  \n\nAs for the Romans, they were ruling over Israel, basically collecting taxes and demanding allegiance to Caesar but kind of letting them manage a lot of their own affairs on a smaller level. They were able to try their own criminals, but under Rome they could not execute capital punishment. For the death penalty, they had to get the Romans involved. So Pilate etc. didn't really care about Jesus one way or the other. He hadn't broken any of *their* laws. He might have been a heretic to Israel but what did they care. They gave in under fear of rioting, so it makes sense that some of them be seen as aloof or conflicted. Amongst the Jewish people no doubt there were those sympathetic to Christ, but the New Testament does describe an angry crowd demanding He be crucified and \"the Jews\" (again these are the religious leaders threatened by Jesus' authority) who are clamoring for His death.  \n\nConsidering all that, I don't think The Passion appreciably alters or selectively relates the story in such a way as to besmirch Jewish people. Not that it is completely accurate of course. There are some artistic scenes like with the demons, etc. that are meant to evoke emotional or spiritual states on some other plane, and a host of other squibbles. In general though it's a pretty faithful portrayal. ","subreddit_id":"t5_2uktl","subreddit":"100movies365days"}

{"body":"&gt; I feel like I might wave watched a different version of the movie, as there was a specific scene in the trailer that I didn't see in the film\n\nIt's really common that things in the trailer are cut from the final film, for various reasons. It's really common, though it's usually just a small dialogue change, but at times they cut full scenes from the film. *The Amazing Spider-Man* was really bad at this.\n\nAlso, I'm glad you liked this movie! I watched it and loved it, and will admit that there were a few scenes in which you could really see flaws in certain aspects. But the overall product was really fun and I really hope they make the rest of the series. Everyone else, however, seems to dislike it.

{"body":"Your formatting looks pretty good, just a couple things I will note.\n\n1. You will need to include a date started (for the challenge) and date watched (for the movie). Preferably at the beginning of the post. You might have just neglected to that on account of it being your first review, just remember to put in your future reviews.\n2. It's not required, but you may want to put the official release year after your movie in the title. For example this particular film would be \"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010)\". This will help in the case of remakes and anything else that shares a name for any other reason. Sometimes it's fun to try and guess which version the person is talking about, but it is best to simply throw in the year. \n3. This isn't a problem with your post, but I do see some other people do it so I'll mention it. Make sure you call the movie by it's full title. Don't simply call it \"Harry Potter\". And don't refer to the first Fast and Furious movie as \"Fast and Furious\", because that is the title of the third film. If that makes sense.\n4. The last thing I will mention is that it appears you tried spacing out your last three lines? To do so, you have to hit enter twice, OR put two spaces in your line before you hit enter.\n\nI hope this all makes sense, let me know if you have any questions.\n\nGood luck on your challenge! :D","subreddit_id":"t5_2uktl","subreddit":"100movies365days"}

The next film (X-Men Apocolypse) looks like it will deal with an essentially new timeline that, as you said, wipes out Last Stand. Can't really speculate too much, but it may wipe out most of X-Men, X2 and The Wolverine (DEFINITE SPOILER... Of course, Wolverine will still remember it all, which I guess will be a part of the next Wolverine sequel.)\n\nNo, unfortunately Quicksilver will not be played by the same actor in Age of Ultron, they will be completely characters. I believe rumours went around for a while saying that they would be the same characters, but they turned out to be false. Due to licensing agreements (Marvel sold the movie and television rights of many of their characters to other studios a decade or two ago, Fox got X-Men whereas Marvel now have their own studio with the films we've got today), Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch fell into a grey area between Avengers and X-Men, so both studios can use them under certain circumstances.\n\nSorry, been a while since I've seen any of the cartoons so I can't say much about that, however I've heard that it was quite faithful to the comics within reason, so I'm guessing it would be close to the comics as well.","subreddit_id":"t5_2uktl","subreddit":"100movies365days"}

It's a real sacrifice and the characters are really traumatized by it. Then his inevitable reincarnation is earned I think by paying off the Chekhov's gun established at the beginning of the movie when the brother says something along the lines \"this chip IS Baymax\"\n\nHonestly all I can say is that it really did have a powerful emotional impact on me, which is obviously pretty subjective.

{"body":"I have two responses to this: first, and most importantly, consuming and praising the art of a child abuser is giving resources and praise to that child abuser. The reason Woody Allen was able to rape his adopted daughter (grand daughter? I don't remember her exact relation) and get away with it was because he's a prestigious film maker. He's untouchable. We have a duty as conscious lovers of film or art in general to hold everyone accountable for their crimes regardless of their artistic talent. Because Woody Allen makes good movies, he is immune to consequences for his horrific actions. \n\nSaying \"you have to separate the art from the artist\" is a cop-out, allowing yourself to refuse accountability for your part in a system that enables the powerful to hurt and abuse at will with no repercussions. Anyone who pays for and/or praises the work of an abuser like Woody Allen is condoning his actions and the system that has not convicted him.\n\n\nSecond I personally believe it is impossible to seperate art from artist. Every piece of art is specifically crafted by an artist with a specific set of beliefs, views, and goals. When you are appreciating art, you are looking directly into the mind of the artist that created it, you are seeing the world the way that artist sees the world. Or at the very least you are seeing the world through a lense created by an artist who wanted you to see the world a specific way. In my interpretation at least, you cannot separate the art from the artist because art is literally a part of the person that created it. It doesn't mean bad people can't make good art, it means that the art of a bad person gives us a window into them, and the badness of a person gives us a window into their art.\n\n(additionally I think it would be difficult in particular to separate Annie Hall from Woody Allen considering he wrote, directed, and starred in it.)","subreddit_id":"t5_2uktl","subreddit":"100movies365days"}

This will help readers know a little more about the movie, and also help to know which version, if it had been remade. The other thing is that I notice your IMDb link includes the ?ref tag. Again, this is very minor, but it makes the link look better, as well as gives IMDb more accurate stats, if you remove the section of the URL that comes after the \"?\". They add that tag so their admins know what section of their website brought people to the page, but leaving it creates some faulty statistics. \n\nAgain, neither are a big deal, nor are they required, I just wanted bring them up to help out.

If you can manage to finish the routine start at the begin nine of W3 again the next week and see if you can finish the other two days and proceed from there. You may also consider dropping back to W2 and building back up to W3 from there. Stick with it and keep trying and I am sure you can do it. Don't get discouraged. Your body is improving regardless.

{"body":"I disagree. I think repeating the same day is bad for two reasons:\n\n1) It's demotivating to do the same workout over and over again.\n\n2) It's more advantageous to take advantage of diversity in rest times that the three days offer. This is even more pronounced for days 2 and 3 for week 5 and 6, where the amount of sets increases greatly.\n\n3) Completing all three days is better for tracking progress. Toward the end of the program, it's likely that many of the weeks will take multiple attempts. I think week 5 took me something like 4 or 5 weeks for me to get past. Let's say you fail on day 1 (Monday). Chances are that during the week you're not going to improve in endurance at all. Wednesday and Friday will likely be of a similar performance, if not weaker if you're going to the point of failure. To see that performance projected on to the same day that you failed is not that useful. To go through and chart your performance on all three days, and see improvements on a week to week basis is useful.\n\nThis being said, folks should approach the challenge however it feels best for them.","subreddit_id":"t5_2rrg3","subreddit":"100pushups"}

It's also 3 days a week, so you can schedule it on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. All you need is a place to run and about 25-35 minutes of freetime on that given day. \n\nRunning includes cardiovascular and aerobic fitness, which is great. You can get to be more flexible which can be handy in everyday life and other specific situations, and you will see increased endurance in any exercise.\n\nDon't take my advice for it.

{"body":"Very late response.\n\nGlad you made it to 76. Your objective was easily met as that passes Army PT, and 76 consecutive pushups requires a great amount of strength.\n\nI recommend you try the C25K program for running. If you can already jog a 5K straight, then try the B210K program to get you from being able to run a 5K to a 10K. The C25K's program as outlined by Cool Runner is a bit easy at first for me personally, but aims to get absolutely anyone to be able to run a 5K (jog ~30 minutes straight) in only 9 weeks. The C25K program is quite realistic as I've heard people with a BMI in the overweight range have passed it with about half of them needing to do a redo week or day. Not many people can't pass it, really! \n\nCheck out their subreddits on the sidebar. Keep in mind, I'm just a W1D2 newbie over at /r/C25K, so don't take my advice: Take theirs!\n\nAnd remember to continue your exercise and try to progress it further. Start doing 75 pushups a day, see if you can keep doing it. If you can maintain that, bump it up some.

{"body":"I was experiencing some mild muscle soreness in the morning back in September of last year, but it would fade away within an hour or two of waking up and moving around. I'm mostly a runner, but I'd been sidelined for two months by a stress fracture in my tibia, so I had started doing pushups, curls, and dips. I live a block away from a nice little gym, so I went for a session with a trainer. I wanted to get some input on starting wisely, since I've never had much upper body strength. The trainer stuck to the idea that soreness is a good thing, even when it doesn't feel like it's muscle soreness, and that the best way to work through it is with more dedicated periods of rest and exercise. \n\nBy November, the morning pain would persist throughout the day but was bearable. By January, I could barely stand the sensation anymore and it was causing legitimate problems--range of motion reduction, difficulty sleeping, etc. I saw a doctor about it in February and she diagnosed a number of rotator cuff issues, mainly biceps tendonitis and [shoulder impingement](http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=a00032) from a lot of inflammation in the area. I started physical therapy after three weeks of taking huge doses of ibuprofen to bring down all the internal inflammation.\n\nAs with all exercise, form is important. The shoulder/rotator cuff is an incredibly common site for exercise-induced injury, and damage to tendons and other tissues that aren't as perfused as muscle takes a long time to heal. I made a likely minor rotator cuff injury much, much worse by repeating load-bearing exercises with poor form. An initial consultation with a doctor or physical therapist--as opposed to a general trainer--would have immediately identified my form issues and provided me with initial exercises to use to adjust that form before taking up 100 pushups/dips. For example, the first three/four weeks of my PT were focused on shoulder-setting, tendon-positioning/stretching movements that set up the area for load-bearing exercise. And it's made a huge difference. I really, truly wish I'd gone down this path before I started and without an injury as a motivator.","subreddit_id":"t5_2rrg3","subreddit":"100pushups"}

Try to space out your protein intake over the course of the day as most peoples bodies can only process around 30g of protein in a 3 hour period.\n\nOP's advice is pretty anecdotal.Although having protein in your diet is incredibly important when exercising, protein timing doesn't matter.

{"body":"So after over 4 months of the '100 push-up challenge' my patience is waning and my improvements slowing. I thought I'd post the data of where I'm at in case anyone was interested in the rate of progress and might like to compare. \n\nHere's some comments:\n\n- Typically, the final set was almost impossible to reach the target, unless I took a much-longer-than-advised break. \n- It was very easy to get lazy between sets. The plan makes clear how much rest to have in between, and I think my lack of progress recently is because in the earlier weeks I took breaks minutes long, as opposed to being under a minute as advised. \n- I tended not to do many exhaustion tests. I found they interrupted with the flow of my week (feel like I'd need another day off and it would throw off my routine) and I also found it a bit depressing how slowly I improved. \n- I'd advise anyone who is attempting this to set up a similar spread sheet and write down your progress. It is much easier to keep track of where you're at and is surprising how many press ups you end up doing - nearly 6,000 in 4 months amazed me once I'd added it up. \n- My style was to rattle out the press ups as fast as I could. I felt if I went slowly I tired much more quickly.\n\nDoes anybody have any advice to continue? I'd welcome feedback. I could also provide the spreadsheet itself if people want it and can tell me how to fileshare it online. \n\nIf I say one thing about this test it is that it takes MUCH longer than 6 weeks to complete. So if you're serious about completing it, be prepared to be in it for the long haul. \n\nGood luck!","subreddit_id":"t5_2rrg3","subreddit":"100pushups"}

{"body":"If your muscles give in before the 100th, you need to work on your strength endurance. \nLifting heavier weight (adding a backpack) will increase strength, but not endurance. Doing clap push-ups is for increasing power. You usually do very low reps.\n\nThere are different things you can do. I'd try to up the volume by decreasing load. For example: Do 100 pushups, when it starts to get very difficult, e.g. at 70 push-ups, go down and do knee push-ups. Can't get to the 100th, still? Do counter push-ups (Push-ups leaning against an elevated surface, like a kitchen counter or a soild table. The higher it is, the easier).\n\nYou could also modify the plan by doing more reps than in the plan (e.g. 30% more) and doing easier push-up variations once you come close to failure (see above).\n\nAnyway, your body got likely used to the stress put upon it, so variation of your workout will give you some new impulses. You can also use this as inspiration:\nhttp://scoobysworkshop.com/zero-to-100-pushups-for-complete-beginners/\n(I am aware that he inclues weighted push-ups, despite of what I wrote earlier.

{"body":"Yes, it can be done but don't expect it to take just six weeks. In my case I was already an experienced weightlifter (15+ years) who could do about 55 max. I started at Week 5 and progressed to Week six which took me about five weeks to complete. At that point I could do 82 max. I kept going and after another six weeks I was able to do 72 on the last set of Week 6 Day 2 and 100 max. \n\nThen I quit weightlifting for five years and started up again about a year ago. At the start I could do about 35 max and I worked my way over many months up to Week six but I couldn't get past 20s in the last set of the Week 6 Days. In my experience Day 2 is the easiest, then Day 3 and Day 1 is the hardest. \n\nI played around with the schedule a bit and also went back to regular weightlifting. Now I do about half an hour of (upper body) weight training M/W/F and do the pushup program Tu AM, Th AM, Fr PM and Sunday PM advancing one day each time so everything continually rotates around. \n\nAfter five months on that program I can now consistently complete week six, with final sets of 62, 74 and 70 for Days 1, 2 and 3. On the down side I did have to repeat week six many, many times before I completed it. On the other hand I am kind of heavy at 192lbs/5'7\" and I'm also over 50, so most of you should be able to do this given enough focus and effort. Another interesting point is when I stagnated at Week 6 I weighed 183lbs and once I started training more often and lifting weights I gained about 10lbs and this significantly improved both my weightlifting and my pushup reps.","subreddit_id":"t5_2rrg3","subreddit":"100pushups"}

{"body":"It comes down to how strong your muscles are to start with. If your triceps are stronger than your pecs then narrow pushups should be easier for you.\n\n\nFrom Livestrong.com:\n\n**Narrow Push-Ups**\n\nHand positioning is crucial in determining the efficiency of a push-up routine. Narrow push-ups are more challenging than wide push-ups as they target the triceps more than the pecs. They also target on the shoulders, back and abs. Hands are set closer and elbows are maintained close to the body, making it look like your hands are directly under your chest.\n\n**Wide Push-Ups**\n\nWide hand push-ups require your hands to be positioned wider than the shoulders. As opposed to the narrow version, where your elbows stick close to your sides, the elbows are slightly flares outward, resulting in greater work on the shoulders. Your chest muscles are put to work and undergo greater work as well. The wider chest area is accountable for the ease in movement, which is why it is less challenging than positioning your hands closely.","subreddit_id":"t5_2rrg3","subreddit":"100pushups"}

It was great for most of my post-enlistment/commission training, but leading up to training this program is not broad enough.\n\nRealistically, nothing will train you for the level of intensity they expect. You will be perpetually burned out and tired, especially the first year. Pushups and situps are easier to max than the run is. Do an APFT and focus on your weaknesses. They will try to make you think that you have to be able to do everything, you can't. But they will push you to. You will be much better off than some others if you enter able to max any one of the categories. \n\nGeneral military advice follows:\n\n* Do your best always.\n* Don't be first or last. \n* Don't volunteer for anything immediately (at least first 3 months of your first year).\n* Do distinguish yourself somehow.\n* Get a legit degree while you are there. If you do one service contract and get out you need to have a REAL degree. Not fuckin criminal justice, or communications.\n\nIf you want to be a PT stud, focusing on something is good.

{"body":"Hello lamlegman!\n\nHere are some answers (from my overall training of different programs and such) to your questions!\n\n1) Sleep is important. Obviously get the minimum recommended hours of sleep for your age. A little extra never hurt though either! Lack of sleep will make your workouts (though this isn't too intensive) slow and you'll be dragging your self around.\n\n2) Your diet depends on your goals. If you want bulk, obviously your caloric intake needs to be greater than that of a normal diet. If you want to cut, your caloric intake must be smaller than usual. Don't skip meals though! Also, water is so important. In my current nutrition program (I'm currently bulking) I drink an ounce of water for every pound I weigh. Hydration is serious when it comes to training, and dehydration will make you sluggish through the entire workout. And of course supplemental whey protein (through shakes or bars) after a workout will help to repair your muscles and build them stronger... obviously a plus!\n\n3) This is really up to personal preference in my opinion. What I do when I fail a day is, depending on my energy level, attempt the workout again later that night to see if I pass. If I don't do that, I just take a quick break and knock out the remaining push-ups in a separate set. Then I just move on to the next day and repeat the whole week the next week. It can be quite hard on the mind to be stuck on the same day over and over again.\n\n4) Rest! Depending on your level of fitness, and if you're doing any other programs, you can also use these day to target other muscles. I personally do speed and agility work on Tuesdays and Thursdays, while doing the push-up, sit-up, and a lifting program on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. If you're dog tired though, just rest! Over-working muscles can lead to injury and a loss in motivation from being sore all the time.\n\nI hope this helped answer some of your questions. Just remember three key things for this program and any other fitness training you may embark on... protein, water, sleep!","subreddit_id":"t5_2rrg3","subreddit":"100pushups"}

He was going to help me to do what I needed to do: talk to pretty girls. Having someone there who knew of my challenge and was supportive is a major help. It wasn't that he explicitly pushed me but his presence implicitly did. Having someone there that respects what you're doing definitely makes me feel less pathetic.\n\nWe walked to a street festival close to my home. On the way I asked some people for the time, asked for a lighter and said hello to total strangers. Obviously these aren't sets, but it helps in becoming comfortable in breaking that invisible wall between you and strangers. It gives you the sense that the world is your playground. I'm going to try this as well when I am alone and see whether it helps in creating a fun-loving attitude.\n\nThe only ATM machine at the festival was broken. When I walked away, a brunette asked me whether the machine was broken. I realized that lady luck had given me a wonderful opportunity and engaged her in a fun conversation. We tried to come up with some creative ways to arrange cash, and finally settled on going to a bar together to ask if we could use their machine.\n\nVeronica and me sit at the bar and start talking, shooting the shit, and making fun of each other. Andy let us be, which I am grateful for. A good wingman knows when to lay low.\n\nA couple of things happened between Veronica and me. We had decent eye-contact, I clearly showed I was comfortable talking to a stranger and I touched her several times. I strongly believe that kino is paramount to creating any kind of romantic interaction.\n\nThe three of us head out for a smoke, and as we walk I say to Veronica:\n\n\"You're really easy to talk to. I like that\"\n\n-\"Same to you!\"\n\nThis was an important moment. I did honestly appreciate that she was a fun chick that was up for a mini-adventure and **I told her about it**. Now if I make any further moves in the future she knows that I am not just interested in her because she's hot.\n\nWhen Veronica left to go find her friends I asked for her number. She gave it without a moment's hesitation.\n\nAndy and me walk on the festival ground and I am starting to get into a great mood. I run into some people I know and I am having a ball making eye-contact with strangers. Througout the night I say hello to pretty girls I've never seen before. They can feel my energy and regularly stop to talk to me and get some of that sweet, sweet positive energy. Like bees to honey.\n\nAt some point Andy was talking to a cute brunette. I realized that if *he's* talking to a pretty girl, I *definitely* need to be doing the same. I immediately opened Barbara.\n\nI was in a high-energy frenzy and started unloading jokes, skits, and total nonsense. She's very entertained. I know I risk being the clown when I'm like that but it feels great to say whatever the hell pops in my mind and running with it. I get her number in front of her two guy friends like its no big deal.\n\nIt isn't.\n\nThe rest of the evening is a blur of me making epic eye-contact, stopping women in their tracks and having them talk to me. There are three other sets I'll count for the total:\n\nSome chick recognized me from primary school. I full-on told her the true story that I used to have a crush on her. She was eating it up.\n\nI stopped this gorgeous 9/10 superhottie with my eyes and presence. We chatted. We laughed. She was 15. Pedobear appreciates. I don't.\n\nI talked to some chick with red lipstick. The red lipstick was awesome, the chick wasn't.","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

{"body":"**Set 1**\n\nWent out with a group of coworkers to Bricktown in Oklahoma City. Bricktown is not my typical hangout, but the number of bars and people there on weekend nights makes it pretty ripe for pickup.\n\nAround 10:30 after having a few drinks and friendly conversation at a quiet bar, we head to a club called Moonshiners, which is effectively a honky tonk (Oklahoma, remember). There's a cover band playing a surprisingly eclectic mix of tunes, albeit at that deafening, have-to-shout-to-make-conversation noise level.\n\nEventually I hit the dance floor which has been sparsely populated all night. I'm usually very comfortable on the dance floor, especially with a few in me, and tonight is no exception. Eventually an attractive woman in a red dress mosey's up and we start dancing. I'm focused on enjoying myself and very few words are exchanged between us--pretty much just \"hey\"--we didn't even exchange names. I used the opportunity to touch her a bit--really just her hips whenever she got close and the occasional spin.\n\nAfter a few songs, we're both ready to take a breather and she says something to me like \"We are so adorable!,\" and we probably were because, I think, by the end of that session, we were the last people on dance floor. I agreed and gave her a small hug as we walked off the now empty dance floor--parting ways as I retreat to the group I came with.\n\nShortly after, I come across the girl with one of her friends. I sit down at their table and shake their hands, \"Hey, I'm Austin. That was great out there!\" I get their names.\n\nFrom here the conversation was pretty rough--basically interview mode in a super-loud club. Everyone had to repeat themselves a few times to be heard with almost every sentence. I kept trying to bring her friend in on the conversation, but I'm pretty sure she was content to just sit there. We do the whole \"Where are you from?\", \"What do you do for a living?\", \"How's your night going?\" thing. It was pretty boring for them, I imagine, but the woman in red was remaining receptive so I continued. Eventually, she offers me her number as her friends are about to leave, which I take. We say our goodbyes and they leave.\n\nClearly my ability to have fun on the dance floor really made up for my inability to have interesting conversation later. It's actually pretty funny, now that I think about it as I found out that she's getting her grad degree in communications; while I'm getting mine in engineering. You'd expect the engineer to under perform in that area compared to the communications major, though I know that's not a good excuse at all.\n\nI texted her the next day a simple \"Hey it was nice to meet you.\" and she responded back positively, complimenting my dance moves. The plan is to try and get her out on a date soon.\n\n\n`__________________________________________________`\n\n**Set 2**\n\nI split from my coworkers and head to another club. I see my set as I walk onto the rooftop bar--3 women and 1 guy who is dressed a little too well--disproportionately to the women at least.\n\nI approach and offer my hand to the most attractive of the three women first, \"Hey, I'm Austin. How's it going y'all?,\" addressing the group as a whole, and get their names. I ask how the women know each other, my suspicion that they are sisters is confirmed.\n\nThe conversation that followed centered around how their night was going, where they've been, etc.--nothing very exciting, and I'm not really addressing the guy very much. Meanwhile the hottest of the three sisters is giving me a really enraptured look--her eyes were sparkling and she had a very receptive smile on her face. I can't remember what I was saying but she was very intent on listening.\n\nEventually the guy in the group makes some loud comment directed at me about the hot woman being his wife. I inquired and it turned out they were engaged, not married. He goes on to address me directly saying something like, \"She's a 10, and when I've got her in bed, she's an 11,\" to which I make the obligatory This is Spinal Tap joke that flies right over the guy's head (and probably everyone else in the group, too). He continues on about still needing to look for more women to sleep with sometimes, all of this going on in front of his fiancee which makes me think he's trying to make a joke or something. \n\nI tire of this guy's AMOGing and make a comment about how labeling women on the 1-10 scale is lame and unfair, though I'm pretty sure no one in the group much cared at that moment, said some goodbyes and ejected.\n\nI guess I was doing something right to get that response from that couple. I was feeling pretty good from getting the number of the woman at Moonshiners, perhaps that was boosting my state.","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

Then I finally reached her when she was two blocks away.\n\n-Open: Said hi to her, but I had to say it twice because she doesn't noticed me instantly, because she was staring at some store. Then I asked to tell something quick, and she agreed.\n\n-Some background to her: I tell her that I was ther looking for a book, then that I saw her and I felt that wanted to talk to her. She smiled.\n\n-Compliment/Intent reveal: Tell her she looked nice and that the pink colour of her shirt make her look really good. She laughed a little, and thanked me.\n\n-Start conversation: I asked if she was there also to buy something. She told me that she was buying clothes but had to take a detour because of some protest march was passing for the main streets now. Then she make a slight gesture about continuing her way. And I (probably incorrectly?) took it as the end of the interaction. So I only wished her a nice day and get away.\n\nAnd it was it.

Me and this guy gamed a few times already, but he was not down tonight. I get downtown and realize I have no plan at all so i head to a shop and grab a coffee.I am not at the point in game where I can just approach random girls and get their numbers/escalate easily yet, so I decided to try to get as many cold approaches as possible but just asking a random question\nI walk around downtown approaching sets I would never even think of approaching on my own, [A 4 set of 9s, a set of milfs, solo cuties,etc] and just ask them simple questions. (Do you have an extra cigarette? Where are all the clubs? Do you know where ___ is?) I managed to get 20 approaches on my own. Some of these I had fun with and I don't include the ones where I got blown off by being completely ignored (maybe 8 or so) whenever that happened I just laugh it off.\nit was the most girls I've ever approached on my own, and I got more comfortable with the idea of just going up to girls and starting a convo.\nOne set I met mentioned there was a university party happening, so I hit it up and its this giant concert with dancing and people shooting fireworks indoors. Fucking crazy shit! That ended maybe 15 minutes after I arrived so I asked another set if there are anymore parties and they told me of 1 so I walked to the next which was about 5 minutes away in the uni's engineering building\nI walk inside, at 3 something in the morning and its basically just a giant club setting. Everyone dancing like mad to music I love, but shit...I know nobody in here, have nobody and everyone seems to be in groups.\nFuck it, I start off with making friends with some of the dudes that were standing around, trying to help them approach a set they were checking out for like 10 minutes. They offered me beer and I said yeah why not, and had 2 small cans and later a tallboy. I felt much more social but from this point on I do not count the sets I approached, but a little beer makes me an awesome dancer...and 10x more smooth with everything\nThen some songs I love start to come on and I just pick out these 4 girls who were dancing in a cirlce and join them. One chick kept rejecting me but I made it a joke to my self to keep trying to get her to dance with me. I love making up dance moves on the spot and when people copy me as if i know what im doing LOL .\nThe music would mix between International dance and heavy metal. So for 45 minutes im dancing to some awesome hits with different groups of girls, and another 45 minutes im in a fucking mosh pit fighting dudes. One girl came in with me, and i was literally blocking dudes from running full speed and tackling her. Tried hooking up with her after, she was a short blonde chick with a jean jacket but she was not down. 3 Black hair chicks literally pulled me into their dance circle, and they were sort of my go to group for the night but I lost them near the end.\nAt the end of the night I meet this sexy 8.5 and chill with her for a good hour just dancing and talking. She had a friend with her [fatty], and it was just us 3 so there was no getting rid of her. I walked them to the bus station and she gave me her FB, as she jumped on the bus with her friend. The both lived with their parents, and far from where we were so no chance for pulling that night but we hit it off so well that I know if her friend wasn't there we would have hooked up like cray, at least in the club anyway.","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

{"body":"Dragonfingers offers sage advice. Humor is great! Especially the last one, where even the guy cant take offense because you're actually complimenting him. If he still does, and shows it, he seems like he's way too hotheaded, which is good for you.\nAnother thing about the first set and the standard interview questions. When you answer those types of questions, throw in some things to spark the quriosity of the other person, and something that says something about who you are. Instead of answering \"I live in Oklahoma\", say something like \"I live in Oklahoma because it has great scenic views and I have a lot of things going there, plus the climate suits the leisure activities that I like doing in my spare time\". This one had three possible hook points for the recipient. \"What scenic views? What do you have going here? What leisure activities are you doing in your spare time?\". It's a subtle way to give much more open answers without telling everything, and it allows the other have a choice of topic. I read an article about this conversation technique on the net some time ago. I highly recommend that you practice this with all the answers to the standard questions that you always end up getting (where do you live, what do you do etc).","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

{"body":"22/04/2014 - 30/100 (target 36/100)\nI went out alone on the streets tonight and aimed to open three sets. I managed one. This was not a great night for me.\n\nI opened a cute brunette by walking next to her and commenting on how the fun fair was really obstructing the view to some of the monumental buildings around. She agreed. Our conversation continued:\n\n\n\"I don't suppose we could come up with the money to move the entire thing\"\n\n-\"Probably not.\"\n\n\"Unless you're rich. Are you rich?\"\n\n-\"No.\"\n\n\nThe conversation then petered out, died and she excused herself. \n\nI wandered around for too long and failed at opening too many sets. There's a distinct pattern to this. First, I decide that I'll open the next beautiful woman I see without hesitation. Just go up, say hello, and let it happen. \n\nSecond, I see a woman I genuinely find attractive and come up with a reason why I should not go. She looks busy. She's talking on her phone. She doesn't look like she's interested in talking to someone. That's probably her boyfriend. Those are probably her parents. She's with a lot of friends. That's too hard. \n\nThird, I consider the value of my excuses, wait too long, and finally decide that I've waited too long to still open authentically. \n\nFourth and first, I realize that my excuses are exactly the fear I'm trying to overcome and decide to open the next beautiful woman I see without hesitation.\n\nOccasionally I have a moment of clarity. I push myself, man the fuck up and go open. But not tonight.\n\nAfter an hour or so I gave up. Getting out there alone and facing your fears like this is one of the toughest things I've ever done.

I missed a couple of opportunities with girls that were responding to the eye contact, as well as with some other cute girls that were just passing.\n\nLater, on my way back, when getting off of a train I made eye contact with a girl (HB7) walking in my opposite direction. I couldn't open her immediately because of all the people walking behind me. So I just waited for people to pass and walked to her after.\n\nShe initially looked at me like a little scared (partially by the initial surprise and probably also because I still looked like very nervous at this stage). But she smiled and laughed after I told her that I wanted to talk with her because I thought that she looked nice. I tried to start conversation helping me with an assumption about her, by asking if she was going to work, because of the way that she was dressed (She was going to school but came from a government dependency where she is doing school practices). We talked about work and school stuff for a couple of minutes (much longer than my previous interaction). She was was nicely answering my questions, but she didn't make any. Then the next train came and she looked at it for a moment, I took this as an exit signal and asked if she was going to go in it, and she say yes, but she wasn't like walking towards the train or anything. So I just said thanks and goodbye and she laughed a little again. I though that probably she was expecting a little more.\n\nSo, I think I made a mistake again by exiting from the interaction at the first sign of the girl having or trying to leave.

{"body":"2/100 and 3/100. I'm doing these both at the same I guess since it was in the same night. I'm not ussually the type of person to be depressed or have issues but today I feel like a failure, approached two girls today and not exactly why I wanted came out of it. So today I went to a pub crawl, if you don't know what that is, it's basically a meet up for tourists and etc or just people in general who go and your bars in Brazil, so I thought \"yeaa, why not seems like a nice way to meet girls and have fun\" (thought I'd note I'm a litte drunk so report might not be grammatically correct) but on to the night. I'll fast forward to the first encounter to the HB 7 -8 I would say, she was blonde but a bit chubby not enough to call her fat but nevertheless she was attractive. During the \nBringing of the meet up I didt say much to her, except find out her name and the fact that she is from Brazil and her English is week. Anyways, night progress find out that a Dutch speaker is friends with the HB7 girl as they are in a group with 2 guys and 3 girls ( the HB 7 being the only single out if the pack) after hearing this I assumes that yes, she clearly looking for a guy. I can be that guy. So after talking with a few other people I came back to talk to her which became a struggle as her English wasn't good. We seemed to laugh about it though as she couldn't understand what I was saying and I guess we both found it funny ( or at least in did) anyways, conversation continues on despite the language barriers and slowly as it progress I eventually ask her if she can dance and pulled her out. However, she moved side to side as I tried this for maybe 15 seconds and the stopped and said nooo, I can't. I took it as a shit test and insisted she tried as I attempted to twerl her around. After not following through the hold spin around thing I assumed she either didn't want to dance or not with me at least. I assumed the positive naturally and My goal was to emulate confidence and told her that I was getting a drink and that I would be right back. Not sure if what I actually went to do matters but I \"appears to go buy another drink\" and desired to chat up another girl who it already new had a boy friend from earlier to make it clear to the HB7 that she wasn't the core of my night. After maybe 3 minutes of conversation with this girl the other girl disappears (hb 7) and I confront her friends and the guys about where she went. Turns out she left I just said bye with no explanation to her friends. This really hurt again. I did everything. Eye contact, a little bit of kino when I talked to her. And I'm an outsider from Jamaica, I'd assume that would trigger some IOIs at least but don't know. I don't know if it was the language barrier, the fAct that I'm not white and blond like her friends boyfriends or anything like that. Or if I wasn't just doing anything right. I get the feeling I'm just suppose to stick with my class if HB -6 and below. I'd post about the other girl from the same club but this is long enough. I don't know how you dark skin guys make it in the PUA world but I'm having no luck. Her friends were cool and liked me. I'm just really confused right now and a bit depressed.

She was really nice and friendly- sorority girl at a nearby college, she was having lunch with her mom who was inside paying the bill I guess.  Anyways, conversation was short because I was so rusty and out of habit.  \n\nThings I took away- \n\n1)  No matter how shitty you open, you probably aren't gonna get someone who gets upset or insults you- they're gonna be flattered you came and talked to them and at least be friendly even if they aren't interested in you.\n\n2)  A lot of your image with women has less to do with appearance and more to do with having confidence and being steady with your emotions and speech patterns.  That's the difference between a successful approach and an unsuccessful one.\n\n3)  If you go a day or two without approaching, you're gonna return rusty and won't be as steady in your emotions and speech when you finally do come back.  **Approach count: 4**\n\n**9/12- Friday**- Today I had my first approach where I was just walking minding my own business with no intent to approach someone.  I left work to go to work and as soon as I get out of the building I see a good looking girl in workout clothes walking perpendicular to me on the other side of the street.  I didn't even hesitate or think about how my hair looked or anything, I immediately went over and introduced myself.  I felt great about that.  The bad news is, unless I can find time to go out and *find* an attractive girl to approach, I won't see one everyday.  I was still rusty and it showed in my approach.  I had trouble getting through it.  She was polite but I could read her body language and see she wasn't too interested, and I think it had a lot to do with my approach being off.  I'm not afraid of rejection anymore- it's true what they say, they really aren't rejecting you (they don't know you), they're rejecting your opener.  I just got to get out and walk around downtown and the mall and community college campuses more often now so I can put myself in a position to play the numbers game.  **Approach count: 5**","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

{"body":"**Set 12**\n\nI hadn't approached since last weekend, which didn't go well, so I had pretty much no momentum. I am finding, however, that if I go out with a group of friends I'm comfortable with and hang out with them for a while talking/just hanging out, I'm more likely to approach--need something to get the gears going, excitation, if you will.\n\nAnyway, I'm at a bar and this local indie band is playing a set. They are okay I guess. The crowd didn't seem very into the music until about the last song (typical indie show amirite?). \n\nAfter the band's set i approach two women and try to strike up a convo about the show. This wasn't going over very well for whatever reason, and eventually the more attractive of the two women kind of starts turning her body away from me, so I say \"Maybe I'll see you around some time\" and eject.\n\nI have a feeling that I was too low energy or something. My delivery was off. These girls seemed like the type who would gladly discuss local music, so I doubt the topic of discussion was turning them off. Also, I probably could have been more persistent and shown intent earlier, as usual. The whole set probably lasted a minute ha.\n\n___\n\n**Set 13**\n\nA group of very well-dressed people in their late 20's congregated near me when I was outside on the patio. I approach a woman in the group and ask if they saw the band. She and a few others gave an interested sounding \"No, we didn't.\" Immediately after, one guy in the group who seemed a little toasted gave a smartass \"Yeah, I saw em\" response, clearly he hadn't. I call him out on the AMOGing, saying, \"You just lied to my face!\" which got a positive response from the rest of the group and the guy kind of shut up from there. That was a good feeling. I'm getting better at those quippy responses that keep conversations fun.\n\n Curious about why they are dressed so well, I ask them, directed towards one of the women, if they were coming from a wedding or something. It turned out they had just graduated, but they didn't say from what. I guessed correctly that it was med school (not hard with that demographic represented), but the same guy responds back, \"No, man, we just graduated college\" in that smartass way. The rest of the group was apologizing for his antagonizing me at that point, and I counter him with something like, \"Oh yeah congrats on that BS in Biology. You're going to go far, man. I hope you can get in to med school!\" (no intended disrespect to all you bio majors, it was a situational joke) the guy was starting to look a little pissed at this point, so I ejected as some friends had just arrived at the bar and another good band was going on.\n\nThat was probably the most fun set I've had because of sparring with the AMOG guy. I feel like I could have kept going and really pushed his buttons, though i don't really know if that would have gotten me in with the rest of the group.","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

{"body":"**Set15**\n\nA few weeks ago, I met a potential wingman at a bar. This weekend was the first time we went out together. I was pretty much starting out from square one, but Matt was very encouraging. I'm not sure how much he has studied \"true game\", but he obviously goes out to meet women and definitely knows how to keep it fun.\n\nWe start at this bar in DTOKC that's next to a few clubs to kind of get loose. I chat with some women in their 30's who are there celebrating their friend's birthday. They seem sort of dismissive, but I can't really blame them. After a bit of this we tell the group that Matt and I are headed to the club next door and that they should make their way over later.\n\nI almost didn't get in the club, as I didn't really have club clothes on (oversight on my part as I hadn't planned on gong out with Matt until fairly late in the evening), but I relented and was graciously allowed to pay the $15 cover. I guess they just do that to keep out the riff-raff.\n\nGetting inside I run across an acquaintance from college. We talk for a while, catching up. He heads off to buy me a drink and comes back with 4 shots of fireball. Apparently he thought I came with a girlfriend or something. I take 3 of the shots and start wondering how soon I'll regret that decision. I was probably already 2-3 drinks in before that point, though I was taking it slowly up to that point.\n\nEventually I make my way to the dancefloor--my favorite part of clubbing. It's really packed. I groove out there for a bit and am definitely getting some attention from the women around me. The women from the first bar show up, and one of them starts grinding on me, unprovoked, so I roll with it and we do that for a bit. I find the grinding pretty hot for a while, but get bored quickly, so I break off so we can dance face to face for a bit. We dance on and off the rest of the evening until she tells me her friends are heading out. \n\nI follow them to a bar down the street, arm over my targets shoulder. We hadn't done much talking in the loud club so we kind of catch up with eachother for a bit until one of her friends turns around, stares at me, and with a really bitchy attitude says \"She's married you know, and has a kid, too.\"\n\nI look at my target who verifies the statement, obviously putting me in an undesirable situation. I really had no desire to mess with anything like that, so I ejected saying something like \"Wow, OK. You guys have a nice night.\" It being late, I headed home.\n\nThe lesson from this approach is definitely that I need to **screen my sets more.** I'm a quiet guy who likes to listen, but I can't make it to the very end of the night just to find out shit like that. Oh well, I had fun and will definitely go out again with Matt, who is a really cool guy.","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

Gave a smile to the woman, got one back, looked like she expected me to talk to her, and I was about to... but then chickened out and looked away, and that was a bit awkward. Few minutes go by, the other guys immersed in their phones or magazines, I give her another smile and get yet another one back! I'm used to having gotten a \"weirdo\" look by this point in my shut-in years that this is quite an encouraging change. \n\nI start talking to her with a not-so-great opener (\"Are you going to X\" kind), but she had a strong accent of a neighbourly state's language so we got talking about that. Could feel her getting more comfortable with me as the convo went on, physically leaning in closer to talk to me. \n\nAt that point the guy next to me interrupted me with something, I replied and got talking to him, and could visibly see her disappointed at my attention change and wanting to get in again. Awesome!\n\nGot back to her in some time, had a fun time (and established some rapport with her, she was smart and sensible too), she actually switched places with the guy next to me (occupied it by herself when he was gone for a moment and requested him to take hers when he returned!), but that became the trigger for the problem - I started feeling like I had \"won\", got complacent, and allowed the AFC inside me to take over. Leaned in too much, literally and metaphorically, she gave me lots of kino but I gave little back, and in general stopped being interesting to her much. She was still interested and talking, but could feel the spark reduced. Of course the AFC only tried to compensate this with more leaning in, so by the end the rapport had eroded quite a bit. \n\nBut the one thing I've been berating myself for ever since I got away was leaving getting her number to the very end. I thought about it a few times but planned to get it after we'd gotten down... only to find she was immediately picked up by some relative when she got down. :( She gave her name and the name of the shop she owns, but I'll have to make up some good excuse if I want to meet her there and will have to work to get a natural #-close from there.

I got a date with a cute mexican girl I met at travelshak, with whom I will go dance some salsa next week :) I also met a very nice girl from slovenia about two weeks ago in Elysium (a club near Schwedenplatz)*, I met a pettite blonde in Flex who gave me some vegan candy (it actually tasted very good, without sugar), I went on a \"date\" with a girl from serbia I met through Tandem wien.\n\nI think my two mayor sticking point as for now are closing and, sometimes, continuing the conversation. Sometimes I am \"in state\" and can talk for hours about anything, other times I just don't know what to talk about and am very quiet. I do not know why this happens.

{"body":"Set 4: My friend Adam is the best wing of all time. Was in a pub for Paddy's and nothing was going down so bet him 3 drinks he couldn't get me the shift that night (kiss close). He immediately said alright and I followed him over to stand a few feet away from two girls sitting down. He was facing them and said one of them gave him some eye contact so he told me to approach. He assessed the situation very objectively and said \"those guys talkin gto them are really drunk. She's snapchatting herself, she's bored.\" I was freaking out quietly and then they got upo to leave and he was like \"quickly they're leaving!\" (These were like the only two girls in the pub- (a HB 8 and HB9) I was like what do i say blah blah pussy blah then he approached the HB9 saying \"can my friend get a picture with you. He does photography and he'd really like a picture with you!\" All said with convincingly high energy. She was like smilling alright and we took a few pictures doing poses and me and adam running banter off each other. \nBasically we chatted a little about her piercing or what have you then he was like lets all go get drinks but the bar was closed. An old man started talking to him so she wandered off and I slunk back in with my AFC friends. Me and Adam exchanged eye contact. i was like when he got back we went and sat at the bar in front of where she was now chatting to these guys. I was bewildered like I don't know what to do wah wah wah. Then he said calmly (we had got drinks off friends) \"pour half your drink in that glass and give it to her.\" I was like what no way she's talking to them. Then i sucked it up annd waved her over with my hand calling her name. (This had worked for me in a previous approach). then i gave her the drink and we resumed the conversation adam mainly carrying it in fairness. Adam was like i'll move soon to let you sit closer to the girl. Next her friend the HB8 came over and sat with us and as she was being hit on by a drunk 39 year old I grimaced with her and struck up a conversation as the group convo lulled as Adam was now talking tot he guys behind us. we started chatting about normal shit and  next thing you know the four of us are leaving the place (we had met them as the lights were going on anyway) and Adam was like let's chack out the prices for the other bar anyway! Said enthusiastically again... And again compliance! We then stood outside mcdonalds for a bit and adam told his girl he had broke up wi th someone yeaterday and didnt want anything so she started shifting this other guy. I kept gaming my girl and took her aside invited her back to mine and she said ok. This wasa fter i briefly left and came back tot he guy telling me the HB8 had called me hot and sexy.. The four of us chatted and then we decided to walk back to mine for tea. a fun walk. I'm realising keeping a conversation going is just about talking about whats in front of you includin g her. As  Adam told me when i grilled him for info before we headed out last night. Everyones favourite topic is themselves which of course i knew, but I didn't KNOW. He also said that if you go on a sdate plannin g out what to say before hand it will be terrible because you'll be terying tot hink of what you had plan ned to talk about rather than just relaxing and enjoying the conversation which is attractive of course. Following your passions doing what you love is key and attracttive. you should never make girls your number one goal in life or you will be miserable no matter what happens. because they are crazy and unpredicable. not a soluid foundation to build your self worth on. Or so adam tells me. And he's right.\nAnyway the four of us head back to mine we have tea mess about with the guitar the HB8 is sitting on my lap head lolled back on my shoulder and we both want each other so bad. The HB9 goes out for a smoke and accuses the guy of being a third tit sdo he leaves and we immediately turn and start shifting again. Anyway they leave so we head to the bedroom. All going great until i can't get it up. Try to oput on a condom twice but it just is all floppy. i apologise and blame the drink knowing its actually more likely the nerves or the fact shes actually hot. Or maybe the fact she had a thing with a guy i know i wanted to get back at so i wanted to be able to say i'd fucked her. all in all I felt the pressure and sex wasa no go even with her sucking efforts..  STICKING POINT: Pickup was great. Walked through a pick up from start to finish by adam i think is a great asset for me to ahve and i think took part to cleared myself of some inertia and will be able to repeat something like that myself. i think this a pattern with me from hot girls that i feel the pressure to score them then find myself unable to. i want the number the notch on my belt more than the experience and I need to calm down and remember I'm doing this for my own enjoyment not to appease some all seeing pick up god.

I responded with \"Ah, that could be true, but I'm willing to take that chance; I am a black belt, so I'm pretty sure I'd survive\", leading to one of the girls very quickly scoffing \"I bet he's a white belt\" - here, I should have responded with some sort of re-framing or something, but instead I let myself get derailed, and began feeling like an idiot.

{"body":"17/04/2014 - 18/100 (target 21/100)\n\nAfter a long day of labor, I found myself once again wandering my neighborhood urging myself to open. Although I felt more comfortable with the approach anxiety, it still took me a solid 20 minutes before I worked up the courage.\n\nI walked up to a fun-looking blonde girl and muttered: \"Hi, I like your hat\". She smiled, thanked me and kept on walking. Bystanders snickered at my half-hearted attempt. I felt self-conscious, judged, and awkward, and glad. Glad that I was atleast one third of the way done with this torture.\n\nWhat was paramount to this interaction was my state of mind. I felt uncomfortable doing what I was doing and I was not having fun. That kind of head-space will certainly seep into any interaction you have, and it certainly isn't attractive.\n\nI walked around for another 45 minutes, damning my inability to push the envelope.\n\nFinally, I came to think about my own value. I thoroughly enjoy being around people, and people tend to enjoy being around me. I felt that I was probably much more interesting than any of the men walking around. Call it a placebo, call it being megalomanic, or call it realizing the truth. Whatever the nomenclature, it certainly helped me to enter a new state of mind.\n\nI felt energetic, playful and sociable. I opened a four-set of deaf women that were having an argument in sign-language. They could lipread perfectly, which impressed me, and I walked alongside them carrying a fun conversation with ease. None of them ended up being particularly great-looking, so I moved on.\n\nI still wasn't opening as much as I'd like, but I was definitely doing a lot better. I actually ran up to a 2-set, only to change my mind at the very last moment. Thumbs up for the running (see Sasha Daygame for some hilarious running openers), thumbs down for changing my mind.\n\nA tall, beautiful woman with style rushed past me and I stop her. \"Hi\". She explains that she's in a huge rush. I do my best to stretch out the conversation but ultimately yield to her time-constraint.\n\nI feel better with each set I open so I decide to do one more. Two blonde women are heading in my direction and stop to look at their surroundings. I walked up to them and open directly.\n\n\"Hi, I saw you from over there and I just wanted to say that you look really cute.\" I acknowledge both of them by looking them straight in the eye, and then focus on the more beautiful of the two for the second part of the sentence. \n\nThey both laugh, and the cute one (Hailee) is obviously digging my approach. We talk about about irrelevant things, while I make sure to get some serious eye-contact in with Hailee. I also make sure to touch her lightly now and then. Hailee's friend is on my side. She actually starts to stimulate Hailee to hang out with me.\n\nAt one point they ask what I was doing that night. I answered directly (James Marshall would be proud): \"I was wandering the streets and trying to get over my fear of talking to strangers\". Both of them were impressed. Hailee: \"Don't worry. You're really good at it.\" I am getting serious indicators of interest from Hailee: she was holding my eye-contact, touching me every now and then on her own initiative, and laughing at jokes that weren't funny.\n\nI get Hailee's contact details and eject the set. Now let me be clear about one thing. Right then, I feel fucking FANTASTIC. I feel alive, powerful, and self-reliant. For all of you out there that there are wondering whether this is worth it: trust me, it fucking is. \n\nThe lesson I take from this is that your state of mind is absolutely vital. What worked for me is being in an upbeat, fun-loving, playful mode, where I felt like saying whatever the hell I felt like saying. A big smile on your face can work wonders.\n\nThere are two regrets about the last set. First, why the hell did I not open sets like that before? Second, in all honesty, I think I could have gone for a street make-out with Hailee. Now that would have been an epic story to tell. \n\nStay tuned, I might have a tale like that in the future.","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

Found a side street and did a mini adventure finding a nice park and a cemetery. Told her we should sit her for a bit, she resisted and I say \"come on\" and get to the bench. Some more kino and touching her hair, going in for the kiss and she turns her head away. She insist to walk some more.

Already in a relationship since 7 months. Interesting that she had known the guy for 8 years and became a couple.

I can only recollect what happened from some keywords, so I'll be shorter than usual.\n\n13:00 - Apparently I talked to a \"medicine student\".\n\n15:00 - I walked down my street in the sun and it was extremely busy. The kind of busy that make me wonder whether I am in a city, or in a moshpit. I opened a pretty looking girl directly. She certainly liked it, slowed her pace, and eventually we stood still. I asked - thank god I did - how old she was. She was 15. I excused myself.\n\n15:09 - I saw a woman struggle with her lighter. I came up to her and I said: \"I have exactly what you need.\" I smiled, and give her some crappy matches. I challenged her to light her cigarette with them, and she excitedly accepted. We had a fun interaction but I felt she had to move on. I commented in the following way.\n\n\"You look like you have to leave.\"\n\n-\"Yeah, I lost my friends\"\n\n\"That's a shame, but then I guess you have to go.\"\n\nAfter which she smiled and left. I regret not being more ballsy (this is a perennial in the Top 10 Things I Regret) and saying something like: \"So tell them to wait for you and then come back so we can meet. You seem like fun.\"\n\n15:10 - I felt energized by the previous interaction and immediately opened the next one. I said \"Hi!\" enthousiastically. She saw me, noticed me, and then completely ignored me. Immediately after that her (supposed) boyfriend joined her and stared at me angrily. I think they thought I was trying to sell them something. \n\nInterestingly, this interaction didn't make me feel awkward, but rather entertained.\n\n15:30 - I walked by a pair of blonde girls sitting on the edge of the building. I kept on walking, damned myself for being a pussy, turned around, walked back, and opened the fucking set like a boss.\n\nNo matter the outcome, overcoming your own fears like that is a win.\n\nI told Kaylee that she looked really cute and I thought that I should say hi. I sat down next to them, and we started talking. I noticed that she was either a bit uncomfortable, or just not interested. Nevertheless, we somehow started to discuss the optimal dildo size for anal enjoyment. Good times.\n\nHer friends joined at some point, which gave me a cue to end the interaction. Before I left, I asked for her phonenumber, which she did not give because it would be too expensive to call since she was foreign. She suggested Facebook, which I accepted.\n\n22:00 - At night, I went to a concert. During the opening act I noticed that the soundsystem was performing poorly. Me, being the wiseass that I am, decided to tell the lady that checked our tickets about this problem. Clearly, Joyce had no say in the matter, but I had some fun talking to her.\n\nI returned to her a few more times during the night for small-talk, and I think I could have probably asked her phonenumber. However, I wasn't really that much into her, so I decided not to.\n\nIt occurs to me now, that I could have still just pushed the conversation to more sexually inclined topics just to have some fun. Just because someone is not your 10/10 doesn't mean you shouldn't have a little fun, and be generally irresistible.\n\nOverall, being exposed to the pressure of opening on a daily basis is starting to have an effect. I feel less dismay at the thought of actually having to open. Getting into the right state of mind is starting to become easier.\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

While I was in the airport, I wandered around a bit, until I found a group of two girls who looked fun, and started talking to them. I feel like they probably saw me wandering around a bit, so I should work on being better at finding my target as quick as possible, and not lingering. We had a short conversation, and it ended with one of them casually hinting that I should go (Saying bye at a point in time when I wasn't leaving), but rejection is to be expected in this exercise, so I'm not too dissapointed. I realized almost immediately afterwards that I forgot to KINO, so I must be more aware of that while I converse.\nMy second set was shortly after the first, as I was boarding my first plane, and we also had a short convo, which ended with us boarding the plane, and getting separated then. I tried to find the girls again, as I probably could have rekindled a conversation if I found them, but I couldn't find them. I then proceeded to find some attractive women on the flight, but the only ones I could find were with their parents, which I consider to be a kinda no-go situation, so I sat down again and just chilled out, as I couldn't do anything more. I didn't have any time in the second airport, as we were moved from line to line (I talked with the people next to me in line, but none of them count for the challenge, as they weren't attractive females), and there were no attractive women on the other flight, so I only managed to get 2 sets in, so I am now at 2 sets out of 100","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

{"body":"UPDATE:  Went to another mall today to continue the challenge.  It was super packed in an almost distracting sort of way and I felt like I was walking around like an idiot, trying to catch somebody walking in my opposite direction.  Wasn't working.  So what I did was I just fucking stopped walking and posted up for a second, like a normal person waiting for their wife who was in the store or whatever.  Very shortly thereafter I spot this ridiculously sexy girl in white pants and a tight white tank top and sunglasses walking through.  I say to myself, DAMN.  This girl was stripper-hot.  So I started walking in her direction to see if I could catch up.\n\nI get up to the side of her and walk with her like I know her and start chatting her up.  She's not thrilled that I'm talking to her (but then again, she's not disgusted either).  I ask her some questions, get her name and age, and just sort of draw a blank from her.  OK, so it wasn't tight game, but it was still super thrilling to just communicate with such a piece of ass (and believe me, the way she was dressed and her attitude was for people to have no doubt that that's what she was).  As I am leaving, my hands are tingling from the rush\u2026  and then.\n\nI come up to a food court area and see a really pretty woman sitting by herself eating.  I walk right up to her and say, \"If you don't mind, I'm going to sit down here for a second.  I don't want to text and walk, it could be dangerous.\"  She smiles and says its cool.  I pull out my phone and add to the field notes I'm taking on my hundred approaches.\n\nThis allows me to settle in for a second.  I start chatting this girl up and somehow it is so easy to just say whatever is on my mind.  She asks, what are you doing, I say \"just walking around and talking to pretty girls.\"  She laughs.  I told her, \"this might sound weird, because I know you're eating, but you have really white teeth, do you whiten?\"  (answers yes).  I then get her number and propose we meet for coffee sometime.\n\nBINGO.  Approaching the crazy hot girl made it much easier to talk to the slightly less hot and more normally dressed woman and pull her number.  All with completely straight up honesty.

Feeling pretty nervous about the whole thing. Friend who is taking the journey with me heads out. I see hmm talking to a group and he pulls me into it. Warms me up a bit and I cant let him out do me lol.\n\n1/100- Pull my friend with me and see a group of two girls. They seem to be older then me (im only 23) I approach them. \n-I see you ladies are sitting alone mind if we sit with you and chat for a bit.\n-sorry these sits are taken.\n-No worries have a nice night.\n\n2/100 Standing aroudn the bar waiting to get a drink. See a girl waiting as well alone. She is decent(im a bit picky) but decide to mingle.\n-It is super hot in here\n-(her) ya i Know right\nwe talk for a awhile I make her laugh a bit. She seems to be enjoyng the conversation but she i s a bit shy and I think I may have been intimidating her because I am a bit out of her league. She says she is with some friends and I say mind if I hang out and talk with you guys for awhile. She says yes but i dont feel a full yes from it and she leaves before i get my drink. I see her later and joke around with her a little but just not feeling her or the situation. Could have got a number probably but did not have enough interest.\n\n3/100 See a group of 3 girls out on the floor next to the live dj\n2 are dancing and another is slightly isolated so I head over and place myself close to her.\n\n-its super hot in here(it really was hot as hell so this is why i was opening with it lol)\n-(her) ya it really is.\n\nI joke around with her. Start buliding up the four key emotions. I get past the attraction stage by being funny, confident, and good looking. I mingle with her friends just a bit to add some comfort along the way. I find out what she does. (note:i skipped the qualification stage but i fixed this I will get back to that later). I decide im not ready for a one night close and even though she is decently cute not enough for me put huge effort. #, close. Texted with her today. built qualification by saying she is funny and that is a very attractive trait people dont have much. flirt a lot. If i had a car I would get a date set up.\n\n3.5/100 Not a full attempt by me. Same friend brings me into a group. One of the girls is gorgeous. I show interest and talk to her. Not really sure exactly how i opened but i think i may have just straight out said she was gorgeous. I chat for a little, I can tell she is slightly interested but I am being faulty with my presence. Not enough confidence. This also makes my humor go down a bit because i am afraid she wont think I am funny(need to remember humor is humor no matter how attractive you are). I slightly pull off. i realized that i should have put effort into her. I was in a good mood and if i just tried hard i could have maybe gone somewhere, she was def worth the effort. Lesson learned.\n\n4/100 Another half point because my freakin friend is in another group of like 4 ppl. Really happy for him because he is not nearly as good looking and a little awkward but he sure is diving in. He kind of dgafs more then me so i am learning from him. \n\nAnyways he is talking with a girl and putting way too much pressure on her. He is a bit drunk at this point and I let him know he needs to relax a bit. I talk with the girl and her friend a little her and there. Obvisouly not trying to close on my freinds girl even though he has freaked her out a bit. Still get to have some nice chats with her. Give her a hug and thank her for being nice to my friend even though he was being overly touchy she laughs and says you welcome.\n\nSummary*Need to stop being a pussy with approaching large groups and just girls in general. Had several opportunities that i passed up because i got into my head. Need to start flowing early not think for 45 minutes and then try. Also should probably try not to use alcohol as a crutch. Probably going to dd for the next one.\n\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

She pulled away saying no and that she's with someone back home. And that I remind her of her cousin. \n\nFair. I was like really its fine its totally ok. And it was I am over her. I am seriously proud I went for it 6 months ago I would never have attempted this. So go me! SP: None it was a perfect storm. ","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

{"body":"Set 22: Approached this girl at a party maybe a HB9. She was talking to my friend. After a while I left the set thinking she's not that hot or interesting but then I saw her and her friend goign to her bedroom for shots and I was like to the friend can I come. Had fun with them then after asked her did she want to go outside and talk as it was roasting inside. We went out and played by the pool me being so carefree throwing a beach ball around, expecting nothing (this was the second girl I'd brought outside that night: I learned from the first one bringing this one to the other side of the pool where it's more secluded. We shifted and chatted and got on well. I was having such fun chatting to her and bantering (mainly just me talking and her laughing; approval seeking I guess lol) that I felt it was better than kissing her-she wasn't a great kisser. \nThen we went back inside. She wanted me to stay but her roommate was there and we were hanging out with others in another bedroom until after a while she went into her own bedroom with the roommate and locked it. I was like shit then Michael who'd got a bj off my friend said go for it man so I knocked on the door for a while asking could I come in, didn't work then I said I'm leaving I just want to say goodbye. She answered it and I took her number.\n\nAbout two weeks later I think we ended up going to starbucks for coffee. Who knows how many guys she'd fucked in the meantime. Got on well then I started getting oneitis as I started t see my friends pair up and started to regard her as MY summer girlfriend. Especially after I'd stayed over. The fact she told me her sister was going shopping with Malia Obama and watching movies with her and that her uncle Peter Chernin was the producer of New Girl and Rise of the Planet of the Apes only served to make my starstruck mind put her further up the pedestal. Bad move. About a week after that after numerous flakes, I'm tired one night, my friends coming over another night, flaking on arrangements; I put her in my phone as flake, i eventually stayed over. I was surprised how quickly she went from kissing to sex, virtually straight away. She is obviously a seasoned veteran, having sex with a different guy every week. I couldn't get it up as I was nervous and I couldn't deal with this mentally for someone to be so used to sex they can go straight to it from foreplay. Oh my sweet innocent Beatrice, you never have sex with other men do you?? \n\nAnyway to continue after numerous flakes she booty calls me one night and I head over and fuck her. In my state of illusions I thought she was really hot and she was in such a high pedestal I came like straight away then next time I got a bj which she was class at so didn't fuck her again. Also was nervous of the awkwardness of not getting it up again. As I was leaving said did she want me to go to the cinema with her as she said she wanted to see a movie and she kinda shrugged it off, obviously not looking for something serious as she's leaving for New Jersey in like 2 weeks. Anyway she flakes multiple times in the interim. One night she texts me to call over and I'm busy gaming so check my phone half an hour later and say I'm coming and she texts back she's about to pass out so another time. Apparently this is actually true. To be fair had I called over she would probably have said she's too tired to fuck and anyway what's another meaningless fuck? I fucked her once anyway that's all I need for numbers lolif that's what I'm going for. Basically it wasn't going to lead to anything anyway. Next night I see her with some guy on the street and she's like I'll see you later shrugging me off.\n\nThe night after I'm at a party across the street gaming again, (go me!). I'm just like fuck it lets burn this to the ground. I drag my friend to hers and we go in. I start talking to her and basically follow her around the house from her room to the living room etc. I see her purposely going into different rooms talking to guys. I'm like freaking out each time like Are they shifting are they riding?? And her friends are like no no of course not placating me. I can see her kinda look at her friends like omg this is really awkward. I'm like fuck it if i plow on at least I can say I tried my hardest. So basically it ends with her closing the door to her room on me saying I'm hanging out with Jamal tonight. One guys like man thats just how it is they're probably having sex. I keep plaguing her friends asking is she riding him?? One of them even checks and says they're not riding and they assure me he's gay. The way she said they're not riding..It was like she was going to say but they're shifting. Anyway away I went actually belieiving them a little not realising that she's moved on due to my clinginess and shortness in bed maybe lol? \n\nI keep texting her trying to meet up knowing really I'd burned it long ago. She invites me to her going awawy party. I bring my friends as I owe them a good party. I say high to her she offers me a shot which I hand back to her. I see her flirting with that guy again and I know at long last that its well over. I say to her that I'm leaving soon it was nic meeting her and if she wants to hang out fine. I told her we prob wouldn't stay long. She is like I've only 5 days left and I say kiss and peck her on the lips then i leave. I walk my freind Julia home as shes very drunk then get a text from this girl I went on a date with asking to meet up. We meet and I bring her to HB9(debatable)'s party and we leave for mine in 5. I pass HB9 on the way out as she's at the door. I'm holding hands with this other girl Rachel as we leave to bang at mine. head back and bang that girl. Just as shes leaving that night I get a text from bitch mcGee saying sorry she wasn't very attentive but she had to deal with cops. Basically trying to keep me strung along and possibly feeling jealous a little from last night. I make one last attempt to meet up knowing I'd truly pushed her to her limits the poor girl really being plagued by me long after I'd killed the attraction by being so needy and she at last kinda ignored it and was like enjoy the rest of your time here and it was lovely to meet me. And that's it.\n\nSP: Got too attached to a girl I didn't really know. We came into it with way different expectations. She was probably the first girl who I felt I could have loved in the future but really that was just because we got on well and I found her hot. I got way too obsessive with getting her and of course ultimately killed the attraction and lost the girl by being too available and wanting her too bad. DO NOT DEAL WITH SHITTY WOMEN. I can see how she didn't neccesarily do anything wrong. It was the fact I was pursuing ehr relentlessly which is soemthing I wouldn't normally do. I got overwhelmed by a night or too of cherishing and having a good time.  Its sad and I'm a little heartbroken but I'll get over it. Basically do not place a girl on a pedestal no matter what. She was really into me too texting me stuff like thanks for coming to a party and having banter with me. And when we were together she was like fuck me almost immediately and saying she wanted it but that she was moving house so could I wait. Kinda wish i kept those texts where she sounds like she's into me but really I can't think of anything that was more than moderate generic flirting. Nothing special truly. It was literally just her texting me about a party in some place and her responding positively to me chatting to her asking her I just saw your twin or wanna rob a bank with me. Also the times where she text me saying what are you up to and me telling her I'm doing something not where she is and not seeking a meet up neing non needy and making her wnat it. She was chasing a bit but I pushed too hard dor the meet up because 1 I wanted the fuck badly for bragging rights and 2 I wante fto make her my summer gf and 3 I was afraid she's get with soemone else if I didn't start PURSUING her which is her nature so really isn't a problem. you have to let these things evolve in an organic way where the male is dominant and non needy for something to evolve into a continuous thing or a girlfriend which may not even be possible as in this case. Actually in consideration these might be indicative of boy to girl attration but really don't mean she was really into me. She was into me in a generic male female flirting way sure. Then I got too clingy and fell into oneitis. She sensed this and dropped me. Simple as. ","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

{"body":"12/04/2014 - 7/100\n\nI met a friend at a slightly posh cocktail bar to work on opening some sets. First, I did a rather smooth opening sitting on a bar stool and making Emily (HB 8) stop and talk to me. There was definitely some playfulness in our talk, but she was there with friends which pulled her out of the conversation. The presence of my friend did not help the situation - I believe she felt awkward because she was only talking to me. Perhaps I could have tried to create a three-way conversation to create comfort.\n\nLater, I was smoking a cigarette outside when she left. We talked a little bit. At some point she said that she was too old for me: a 10 year age difference. I agreed wholeheartedly that she was WAY too old for me. She laughed and left. I'm glad about this interaction, but I think I should have gone out guns blazing and said something wildly inappropriate such as \"We should make out, oldy.\"\n\nOn my way back inside the bar I opened a 3-set of blonde and beautiful women. They were bitchy and I had to grind through their continuous attempts to make me feel uncomfortable. I succeeded eventually, which taught me a good lesson on how important it is to stay calm, and to stay true to your personality. I didn't budge - they eventually did. One of them was definitely my type, and I regret not asking for her phonenumber.\n\nAfter this my friend and I went to a club. I opened a large number of sets, but I was blown out of most of them almost instantly. It occurred to me that perhaps, being direct (specifically in your opener) might not be a great strategy during night-game. Maybe this is because women expect to be hit on at night, and that this makes direct openers come across as cheesy. Do you guys have a similar experience?\n\nNonetheless, I had some success in attracting a bubbly, fun, pretty woman named K. There was a great conversation, and I held strong eye-contact. I also blatantly hit on her. She liked it in some sense, but she didn't that I was \"that type of guy\". This eventually led to her declining my invitation to have a drink some other time. This strengthens my feeling that perhaps direct game is best left for daytime. Or, perhaps it is just me not calibrating enough.\n\nFinally, I did an indirect opening on a young Portuguese girl that looked surprisingly much like Penelope Cruz. I asked for a lighter and started talking about all sorts of things. I focussed on keeping my voice low and calm, and maintaining eye contact while thinking about how pretty she looked. She was clearly attracted to me.\n\nI was up for making out with her, and I attempted to isolate her by asking if she wanted to come sit down with me on a nearby, somewhat secluded, coach. Looking back on it now, I should have probably taken the lead more strongly: \"Let's go sit over there\". As you might have guessed, she declined.\n\nI thought about asking her phonenumber and I eventually didn't. No regrets here. I was not interested enough for an actual date situation, and I don't think she was down for some fucking with no strings attached.\n\nI left the club to have wild sex with M, my FWB. A successful night if you ask me: sex and sets.\n\nLooks like I have two more left for today.","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}
{"body":"**Set 5**\n\nAfter the soccer guy blowout I walk downstairs to a different part of Speakeasy. A girl in a 3-set is eyeing me  pretty hard. I'm not particularly attracted but the IOI was there, so I said \"fuck it\" and approached, opening with handshakes. The small talk starts up again, but this time it feels like they've approached me. The girl who gave me the hard look before the approach is asking question after question. They ask if I came alone and I admit that I did. They seemed fairly impressed by this, but I don't think my attitude was really helping me build much rapport.\n\nIt was a bit of a relief to be on the other end of the conversation compared to the other interactions from the evening, but, honestly, it wasn't much fun. I wasn't very physically attracted to these girls and our personalities weren't clicking particularly well, either, but they remained receptive--possibly out of politeness. Eventually the interviewer gal says shes going to go get a drink. I opt not to follow, though I think I could have with no problem.\n\n___\n\n**Set 6**\n\nHaving spent maybe 45 minutes at Speakeasy, I leave and head back to Edna's to see how the crowd has developed. On the way there I walk alongside a goofy guy with a curled handlebar mustache whom I suspect was on a similar pickup mission. I should have asked about it but we were having a bit of an odd conversation if I remember correctly and I never got the chance. I later saw him rocking out at Edna's to Nelly's Air Force Ones. Fuck I should have gotten that guys number or something. He seemed fun.\n\nI get to Edna's and its pretty darn crowded. I walk up to the first set I see and start talking to the two women who were probably in their late 20's/early 30's. This time conversation is a little flirtier than previous approaches and I'm doing light kino whenever we laugh and stuff like that. Eventually they ask my age and are not very receptive when I tell them. I guess their ages and guess a little young on purpose and they seem a bit flattered but not particularly impressed. At this point they try to pawn me off onto their friend across the room. I think the apparent age difference made them feel like they could order me around or something. I probably wasn't assertive enough. I talked with their friend for a bit out of politeness and ejected.\n\n___\n\n**Set 7**\n\nI walk towards the bar and spy a blonde woman about the same age as the set I just approached. I approach and we start talking. Eventually, we get to the topic of work. She reveals that she sells medical supplies for a living and that I'll never guess what type of product she sells. Racking my brain, I pick the grossest medical device I can think of. \"Catheters!\" I guess and guess correctly. She's super surprised that I got it right and sort of freaks out, \"Did someone put you up to this?!\" etc. The conversation then proceeds to catheters and the sort-of-hilarious-but-actually-sad duality of the product. I turn my back to quickly order a drink and turn around again to find she's left. People must not like talking about work on a Saturday night at a bar, go figure...\n\nThis was a short approach, but I think I saw some improvement. The catheters guess was really just an attempt at self amusement that sort of backfired when it turned out to be the truth and I continued down the road of work small talk. If I can cultivate that mentality a bit more I think I can maybe start having more interesting/successful approaches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

{"body":"16/04/2014 - 14/100 (target = 18/100)\n\nYesterday (15/04) I was cycling home after my weekly climbing class and I did something I never have before. I opened a girl on a bicycle, Sarah (6.5). Sarah was going in the same direction on a bicycle that sounded like it was about to fall into bits. I commented on her vehicle's sketchiness, and likened it to mine. My bicycle is a piece of crap. Conversation was a breeze, and I was certainly getting some indicators of interest. She invited to come have a drink at a bar. I declined, because she wasn't the kind of quality woman I'm looking for. \n\nI had an interesting insight right after. I thought I had seen up front that Sarah was not amazingly beautiful. But you can never be really sure. I am a big fan of being direct, and it occured to me that being direct to a woman of questionable hotness implies that you should open indirectly. It doesn't make any sense to open with \"Hey, you look stunning\" if you don't really believe that. So in this sense, situational openers can be direct and can be part of a direct man's toolkit.\n\nAfter Sarah, I was on a roll. My workout definitely played a part in this as well. I felt relaxed, at ease, and manly. Walking to the supermarket, I opened an Australian girl who was somewhat frightened of a stranger saying hello. I walked along side her at a few meters distance and carried on talking as if there was nothing special about this. She kept on responding, but certainly wasn't ready to stop and talk. I suppose that if I had wanted her to stop, I should have said something like: \"Hey, I know this is strange, but I thought you looked amazing and wanted to say hello\". Needless to say, I didn't have the balls for that.\n\nIn the supermarket, I had some solid game with the woman at the cash register. I wasn't truly interested, but it was a good challenge. How playful can you make a conversation in a limited amount of time?\n\nToday, I planned to do seven sets. I did three, but I am proud nonetheless. I left my apartment with the goal in mind to open in my neighborhood. I was scared shitless. I usually open in a much less intentful way. Opening with the mindset of \"I am going to walk up to women and hit on them\" is fucking terrifying. I had hoped that this fear had faded by my prior experiences, but it has not. For thirty minutes, I walked around aimlessly through my neighborhood.\n\nThis is good wake-up call. My game is severely underdeveloped in this aspect.\n\nThe first set was with an English woman of 27. I asked for a lighter and striked up a conversation. I was nervous, and it certainly affected the quality of my voice. She liked me enough, and invited me into this bar to meet her friend Kayleigh. Kayleigh was a straight-up 9. A guy came up to her to tell her she looked like Megan Fox. He was right.\n\nI was only partly able to carry a conversation with Kayleigh, and it was hard to involve myself in the conversation when the two women were talking amongst themselves. At times, I was merely a spectator of their conversation. Not a great place to be.\n\nBeing direct would have required me telling Kayleigh that she was absolutely stunning. I didn't. I feel also that, perhaps, that may not have worked. She was the kind of beautiful that hears about it all the time. I am wondering if doing more \"The Game\"-style negging, although I am not a fan, would have been appropriate. After finishing my drink, I excused myself.\n\nAs I walked home I saw two short-haired women sitting. I opened by asking for a lighter (note: asking for a lighter is definitely a crutch of mine - I should try to avoid it). It was easy to have a pleasant conversation, but I found it hard to turn the interaction romantic. Truth be told, I didn't really try. \n\nAt some point, the cuter one showed me a picture of her in some traditional German clothing. Beside her stood a man. I asked whether that was her brother. She replied that it was her boyfriend. Here, I could have atleast gone out guns blazing, and said something like: \"Well, I'm glad he's not here because I was just about to hit on you.\" or \"That's a shame, you are absolutely beautiful.\" Anything that would have atleast made my intent clear.\n\nSo, challenges met, and challenges partly overcome. I feel taken aback by the struggles ahead of me, but I am confident that I will soldier on.","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

I couldn't at all think of any interesting opener so just started with a random \"hey is that pudina [mint leaves ] in your hand?\" She replied \"no, it's spinach\" and at once I saw it obviously was. At this point she was still curious about this weird stranger approaching her, but I couldn't believe I'd been idiot enough to mistake spinach for pudina which made me just mumble a \"thanks\". This was useful though in thati could immediately see her body language turn hostile and uninterested after my mumbling, was powerful to see body languages being this obvious.\rSecond approach was today, waiting outside a bank Atm booth, compli-negged a girl on her fully matched clothes and accessories, but just then it became my turn to enter the Atm booth so couldn't continue the conversation.

{"body":"**Set 3**\n\nThe following night I walked to the bars near my house alone. I had spent most of the day working around the house, running errands, and studying and was still in that get-stuff-done mindset, especially with the fairly positive reactions I got from the previous evening's approaches.\n\nI start out at this place called Edna's--a dive bar that packs them in on the weekends. The venue itself doesn't offer anything remarkable, in my opinion, unless you're really into sugary drinks. The crowd here is usually pretty young and fairly preppy--a lot of older college students and young professionals. I fit in fairly well with this demographic, but I feel like I may have hurt my chances by donning an outfit more in line with the hipster uniform than the yuppie folk (short-ish jean shorts with an old short sleeved floral print button down I thrifted a ways back). It got some positive comments throughout the evening but I feel it may have come across as tryhard in that scene.\n\nAs i'm entering the bar, I see a 2-set towards the back of the room, which is very small, so not too far away. It's a little early and the crowd hasn't quite formed yet, so I quickly order a drink for myself and walk directly to them--opting for the handshake opener I used the night before. I get their names, give them mine then ask how their evening is going to which, of course, they inform me is going well. With that my mind sort of goes blank.\n\nI'm standing there, kind of looking away from them in an attempt to just say something, and thankfully they read my struggle or whatever and ask me how mine's going. I tell them its going well and about the local pro soccer match I watched this evening with friends--asking them if they've ever been as the stadium where the OKC Energy play is right up the street from the bar. The whole time they seem to be losing interest, but keep playing along. Eventually they ask my age (23) and they were sort of surprised by the answer, I think. It was a little hard to gauge their reaction.\n\nSmall talk like this continues, they ask me what I do and one of the women actually probed a little further into my engineering profession, surprising as I find most people don't really care about those details. It turned out that one of the women was an IT recruiter. Having learned this fact, I ask probably the lamest question of the night: \"So is Linkedin your favorite website?\" I'm sure there is a semi-funny/charming way to ask this question, but I didn't do that. Her response was a very bored \"Yeah, definitely,\" as it should have been. From there, the ladies excused themselves and promptly left the bar.\n\nObviously that wasn't a great set, but it helped me get more into the talking with strangers mindset. The biggest lesson from this set, for me, is how women are generally receptive to cold approaches. I fully expected them to be super dismissive the second I opened my mouth. I stumbled pretty hard in the beginning, but the two were willing to help me out and keep the conversation going.\n\n___\n\n**Set 4**\n\nAfter the fairly easy letdown with the 2-set, not seeing any females that pique my interest at the time, I move on to a bar down the street, called Speakeasy. It is a lot more refined than Edna's, while catering to a very similar crowd. The bars in this area are fairly close together, relative to Oklahoma standards, and almost never charge a cover, so I'm fairly free to change venues as frequently as I like.\n\nWalking around the club I spot a gorgeous blond girl seated at the bar next to a slightly older woman who appears to be with a guy. I open, going for a handshake and name exchange. Immediately, the girl is very receptive. We shared a very long gaze as I entered the room, so I wasn't too surprised. Again, I do the small talk stuff (noticing a trend??). I get it out of her that she's a college student and from a small town I've never heard of, for which I lightly rib her on, asking her what it's like being in the big city. Conversation is going well enough--I feel like she was glad for someone to talk to (I had popped my head in to Speakeasy before Enda's to scope the crowd and saw the same girl sitting at the bar on her phone). Her friend comments on my shirt, saying she likes that it's obviously an old piece that I thrifted that can remain relevant today while standing out a bit. I also ask this set about the soccer game, since Speakeasy is sort of the unofficial home of OKC Energy fandom.\n\nAs we are talking, a tall, lean guy steps immediately between myself and the girl, hugging her and asking her how she's doing, clearly a prior acquaintance of the set trying to assert himself over me, which he does fairly well. I admired his calm, fairly soft spoken confidence he had. I introduce myself to him, trying to bring myself in on the interaction. If I hadn't I was sure to lose this set entirely. As we talk, his friends show up and I recognize them instantly as members of the OKC Energy FC, the local minor league soccer team I saw play earlier in the day. \n\nWith that realization, I kind of nerded out a bit too hard with the guys and lost focus on the set, allowing the new guy to swoop in. It was an obvious mistake on my part, and I probably should have tried to keep going with the girl but it was obvious the girl had come to the bar to meet up with them and I chickened out. Still it was cool to get to know the players a bit. We were all about the same age--fairly fresh out of school--and I had something in common with them in that I ran XC and track in college at a fairly high level.\n\n* **Takeaways from this set:** \nSometimes guys don't approach women enough (early in the night, at least) and those women get bored. Bring something interesting to the interaction and there will probably be a positive result. \n\n* **Action items:** Improve on dealing with guys who try to blow me out","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

One more step in erasing my social anxiety, also had fun, and relevant to this thread, approached quite a few women too. Of course the interaction was just \"Happy New Years\" and \"Same to you\" and transfer of candies, but it still brought a smile out of them, and I'm counting it because it helped me - hey, my sets, my rules :) \n\nAlso forgot to add in my post, any suggestions that might work in such an environment are definitely welcome!\n\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

She said she was running for an officer position and I told her I would only vote for her if I got free pizza. Made her laugh and got her name. Then I turned back to girl A and told her she looked cute in her dress and walked away. \n\n\nI really like doing this and it definitely is affecting my confidence.

She was like \"Not much\" then her friend came and the girl shifted me passionately then said we're going to go this way. I was like should I come and she said I don't mind.

After about the 8th shop I spot a girl who we could roughly give the title HB 8-9 (depending on how high your standards are) Regardless, this girl was attractive enough to make me stop what I was doing and give her a solid 10 second stare (no she didn't see). As this all was happening, the nerves stated to kick in. And real good too. Before giving it too much thought, I just thought go, just say something nice. \"That dress looks really nice\" I said as I approached her from the other end of the table. No sooner as she saw me she ignored what I said turned around and continued to tour the rest of the store. It kinda hurt. Took a lot of guts to do it that to not even get the \"I have a boyfriend\" excuse or something else. Ill be honest and say that it still stings maybe because I'm thinking about it a lot.

After some time I could not figure out who it was so I politely asked. The girl told me her name and for the life of me I still could not remember who it was. The name did not ring a bell. Finally I asked a stupid question to make it obvious, about where she went to school. Now I knew who it was and had to play it off like I wasn't completely ignorant. Turns out  when I flirted with this girl at the bar a couple days prior I got her number, but never her name. Anyway, I told her I was free tonight and I would like to take her out for a drink. Picked her up at her place and when we got the bar she offered to pay for the drinks because she was \"late\" and I had to give her a ride. Mind you the ride was only a mile or two. The rest of the night went well, I dug into her ambitions, and played up my own DHVs. Closed the night simply returning to her place.

After a while I talked to her again by reading the names of some guys on the list \"Jack, Jacob, Billy etc., wow you must have a lot of boyfriends.\"  She giggled and tried to say that they were her friends from some group but mistakenly said boyfriends. I just went with it and joked about how he was into polygamy and asking her if she was from Utah and such. My friend, who was sitting on the otherside, played a shitty wingman and jokingly told us to stop flirting. She later clarified that they were friends of her bf and part of some social group or something. The rest of class I just messed around with her, teasing her to participate when the professor came around our side. She was always giggling, smiling and joking back.

My first rejection of the night. But the night was still young, I kept on telling myself I'm here to have a good time.\n\nWent to a different bar, danced a little. Then went to the balcony to get some air. Had my drink in hand and was just looking around to take in the atmosphere. Where I had ended up standing was actually next to an 8 and her friend 7. They too came out for air. I was just relaxing when 8 said that place inside is too hot. Had a short back and forth conversation, and I started to kino, which she did respond too. But, there was this older, shorter guy who was also there. I assume he had been working her for a while. He eventually stepped between us. I was again not worried. Just wanted to have fun. Moved my attention to friend 7.\n\nHad a short back and forth conversation. She was still sort of half dancing to the music coming from inside the club.

I walked to her by her seat and said hi, asked her how her night was and who she was here with. No boyfriend, so I immediately kinoed and kinda escalated really quick. She was game. Escalated till we made out. She wanted me to but drinks for herself and her friends. I kinda wanted to walk away, thinking I was just another walking atm. But thought, might as well see where this leads.\n\nMade out some more and she was really into it as my hands became very adventurous.

{"body":"11/04/2014 - 2/100\n\nTwo sets today, so I am already one set behind on schedule. I will make it up with four new ones tomorrow.\n\nHB 7 - Daytime at university. Opened indirect, discussed some work-related problems but the sub-text was clear. Kept strong eye-contact and mainted calm, strong body-language. A few of the guys around viewed me as alpha which certainly didn't do any harm. Went to get a quick bite to eat with HB at the university cafeteria. Found out she had a boyfriend, and found out that I was not attracted to her enough to escalate. Had a wonderful conversation nonetheless.\n\nHB 7.5 - A girl my age, but much taller. I saw her at a friend's house. We had met before . I had already showed my interest and got her phonenumber then. I called the next day, she did not pick up, and I never called again. I think it was my fear of taller women.\n\nThis time we left my friend's house together and had a good conversation flowing, so I asked her to grab a quick beer. We talked, laughed, made fun of some people, and agreed to see each other again at this great little jazz-caf\u00e9 I know.

Was on a big downer probably as I haven't been out in so long and have literally gone so far back in my head I was ridiculously stifled. \nI knew most the girls there, friends, two girls sat down beside me and I immediately said \"Hey you're Mark's friends right?\" They were like yeah haha we think we're the only teo girls here from his hometown. I shook their hands and asked them their names then they asked me mine. I then commented \"Yeah I said I'd better say hi to ye otherwise you'd be sitting here and it'd be super awkward\" to which they laughed. Chatted for a bit then went to get a drink only to come back and the Hb8 to say \"Oh so we're cooler than your other friends?\" jokingly as i'd come back. Chatted for another bit then the convo kinda dried up. Birthday Boy showed up and starts talking to them. I kinda slink out of the convo evne though he's a good friend of mine??? I talk to the HB8 again later in the  oight briefly about what she's doing in college and for the summer. Kinda interview mode. Then I think I left cause I couldnt think of anything else to say after an awkward silence.\nI felt really bad and down on myself later when she was talking to and presumably hooking uip with another guy I think they went home together. Makes me sad. Oh well. The game is fucked but fuck it I'll plough on. Probably only got a little obsessy about her as there were like few other girls there and I felt like I had a chance but I blew it as I couldn't keep the convo going. \nSP: Good job approaching was done very smoothly. Must learn a few default fun things to talk about naturally in an awkward silence. And must certainly be gentler with myself and not berate myself for everytime another guy gets a girl I'd been gaming instead of me. Gotta have my own back because girls certainly won't!

I got diagnosed with Diabetes type 1 and chose to spend all my energy on coping with that. But now I' ready to go after the lassies again.

{"body":"**Set 8**\n\nI got a fairly late start tonight (11:30) due to other social obligations. I wish I would have been able to go out earlier, but I guess it wasn't in the cards. As I mentioned in the first update to the original post, I felt like I had lost all momentum from the previous weekend, having not approached anyone all week. That was really putting a damper on my approaches, and I had to have 3+ drinks in me to muster up the courage to get started again. Unsurprisingly, they didn't go well. I definitely need to make this a priority during the week. Forgive me if these reports have glaringly obvious typos, as I am still a bit inebriated.\n\nAnyway, my first set of the evening happens while I'm talking to two guys at a bar near my house. One of the two gentlemen had made a joking \"Hey, what's up man?!\" as I walked by them for the first time. Sensing potential excitement, I obliged the guy, and they turned out to be pretty cool. I was having some fun conversation with them when a 3-set walked by. One of the three seemed to intentionally pause near me, so I  take that as a sign of interest and tap her on the shoulder and introduce myself. She seemed really receptive to me from the beginning. From there I got the names of her friends.\n\nWhere I went wrong, I'm pretty sure, was when I tried to bring these girls into my conversation with the two guys I just met. In hindsight, they clearly didn't car about them, and me doing that made them lose interest almost immediately. A male friend of the 3-set arrived and the girls immediately ignored me and started talking to him. I let them go from here and they wandered off. I think I could have maybe followed and gotten a little further with one of the three, but, at the time, I was content to keep talking with my new guy pals because it was the **easy** option.\n\n---------\n\n**Set 9**\n\nI said goodbye to my new pals and headed upstairs in the bar. I'm scoping the crowd as I spot two blondes walking the other way. Turning around, I see one of the two doing that thing women do with their hair when they want to get a guy's attention, so I tap her on the shoulder and attempt to strike up conversation.\n\nI get her name and her friend's name, but instantly their guy friends show up and I spend too much time talking to the guy friends and the 2-set bolts. :/\n\nI'm noticing a trend. Perhaps, I need to be more persistent.\n\n--------\n\n**Set 10**\n\nFinishing talking to the last set's guy friend, I see this girl that I have approached before in the past. She's with the same girlfriend as last time (she bitched me out for being too persistent last time, even though my target was not complaining at all, causing me to give up &lt;&lt;**PERSISTENCE**&gt;&gt;). I approach, stumbling into the opener, getting their guy friend's name first.\n\nMy target looks vaguely like some celebrity to me, so I was trying to get the group to take stabs at who she looks like, as I honestly don't know. I definitely wasn't coming off well--probably looking like some drunk guy trying to hit on a girl or something (not far from the truth at this point). They were very dismissive from the beginning, though I feel like my target was showing some signs of interest--who knows at this point, though. They weren't having any of it and left pretty quickly.\n\n\nSo this was a rough-ish night for me, but I can't really complain too much. At least I was getting out there. Tomorrow (Saturday), I want to get some day approaches in, if I get the chance--something I've never done before. I will definitely be going out in the evening and plan to only drink for pleasure--nothing more than a buzz. Maybe driving to a bar will help with that.\n\nCheers","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

{"body":"**9/2- Tuesday**- First day back, I don't really know where to go to find girls, so I just kind of walked around downtown for about 20 minutes after I got off of work at 5.  I saw a couple of opportunities, but froze up and my brain thought of excuses before my legs started moving.  I pussied out.  **Approach count: 0**\n\n**9/3- Wednesday**- I'm feeling kind of shitty after I no showed yesterday.  My instructor told us that 20% of us, probably wouldn't do another approach after that weekend.  I'm scarred of ending up in that 20%.  Again, I get off of work at 5 and walk around downtown.  I don't see too much talent out today except for one girl just sitting over by herself.  She's not hot but she's cute, she has a little bit of an indi type of vibe. I can't tell from this distance how old she is, she looks like she might be about 5 years older than me.  I realized what my brain was doing by coming up with all these excuses after I passed her.  I walked a little bit further and then decided to put an end to this bullshit- I was gonna do a fucking approach.  So I turned around and walked back to the cute  girl sitting by herself.  I walk up and tell her that I saw her sitting over here and though she was cute and came over to introduce myself.  She smiles slightly, but as I go to sit down next to her, she says she's actually just enjoying sittting by herself, but that she's very flattered.  I say ok and walk away feeling sky high that I'm not one of the 20% that wouldn't do another approach outside the company of the instructors.  **Approach count: 1**\n\n**9/4- Thursday**- Today I left work for at about 12:30 for lunch, only I didn't go to lunch.  I went to walk around downtown for 30 minutes and see if I could get an approach in.  I spot this blonde chick up the street, I keep walking and we pass each other, I turn around immediately with no hesitation and walk up next to her, tap her on the shoulder and introduce myself.  She lights up and we start talking for a little bit.  She has a cute face, but her body is fucking out of this world- athletic with double d tits, I'm doing all I can to look up into her eyes and not down at those monsters.  She's very friendly and we had a good connection but when I ask for her number she says she's married.  It happens- doesn't change the fact that I had the courage to approach a super hot stranger in the middle of the day.  **Approach count: 2**\n\n**9/5- Friday**- Today I left work again at lunch to go out and wonder around downtown.  I see this girl crossing over to my side of the street up ahead- very attractive, very well dress, but clearly a very nice body underneath.  I walk up kind of fast to catch up with her and right when I'm about to stop her she turns the corner.  This kind of throws me off and I just kept walking straight.  I don't know what happened but I should have turned around and caught up with her again.  I pussied out here.  So I keep walking and I see this girl out in this striking blue dress- tanned body- looking very good.  She is way in front of me on the other side of the street.  I try to walk fast and catch up, I get held up at the cross walk trying to cross the street.  Eventually I get on her side of the street, far behind her but she's still in eye view.  I walk really fast to try to catch up but I see her get in her car and leave before I can catch up.  I won't count that one as me pussying out since I was headed in her direction with every intention of opening her, but in hindsight I should have started running to catch up.\n**Approach count: 2**\n\n**9/6- Saturday**- Got up early this morning and went downtown.  Walked around for a little bit and didn't see much going on.  On my way back I saw this cute girl walking by herself in a football jersey.  I stopped and approached without much hesitation.  Turns out she's a hostess at a local sports bar and was going to work.  Got a good reaction from my approach, but my brain kind of froze up a little in the conversation and I felt like it wasn't going anywhere.  I let her walk without asking for her number.  I should have tried to stick it out and ask for her number, but you live and learn.  **Approach count: 3**","subreddit_id":"t5_2spw3","subreddit":"100sets"}

In doing this I came across a lot of interesting shops and places and clubs. Now I had no intention of getting drunk as I had a flight in the morning at 6 but since it was my last day and I had the money why not. Now as I've reported before, most women here don't speak English so for openers I most approached and inquired if she spoke English and then went ahead with a conversation.

I  was actually going to walk away at this point as I saw it pointless trying to communicate with two girls who didn't know English too well, until she called me back with the statement, \"you're just going to leave like that\" I replied by saying that I would love to talk with her more but my jamaica accent is a bit thick and she might not understand it ( related this twice as she didn't understand the fist time) she then replied with \"oh my gosh! You're from Jamaica! And a few words in Portuguese.

{"body":"I'm hesitant to ascribe the actions of military planners to something as nebulous as \"romanticism,\" especially with reference to the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nObviously WWI was a gigantic blunder from start to finish, but that doesn't mean the men running it were idiots. They were highly intelligent and in particular educated about the most advanced warfare tactics. The idea that such men would make idealistic views of the military their highest priority seems an oversimplification (though I'm sure they did have their romantic side, as we all do).\n\nI don't know what the prevailing view of Napoleon was in 1914, but I doubt he was romanticized as much then as he is now. During his lifetime and immediately after most of Europe viewed him as the most evil man who ever lived, and the wars he fought were viewed much the same way we now think of WWI. I don't know when that view changed to our modern notion of the Napoleonic Wars as romantic, but I suspect the catastrophe of WWI had something to do with it. So I suspect in 1914 the military planners' highest priority was to avoid recreating that era.\n\nOf course that still doesn't explain the lack of camouflage, and I can only speculate as to why soldiers would continue wearing red for so long. As a complete ignoramus in military matters, I must say camouflage does seem a bit overrated. I can see why it would be useful in jungle warfare (e.g. Vietnam) or in the desert, but I don't see why it would be necessary in trench warfare. On the Western Front you knew exactly where your enemy was and you knew when they charged across No Man's Land. Therefore I assume the reason for such seemingly impractical uniforms is that what you wore made no difference.","subreddit_id":"t5_2y3jq","subreddit":"100yearsago"}

{"body":"It was a continuous struggle between the pro-German palace and the pro-Brit government.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Schism\n\nAs the Great War began, the Greek authorities had to choose between neutrality and aligning themselves with the Allied forces. Outright participation in the war on the side of the Central Powers was not an option, both because of Greece's vulnerability to the Royal Navy and because, from early on (October 1914), Greece's traditional enemy, the Ottoman Empire, had joined in on Germany's side. Hence, neutrality was the course favored by most pro-German Greeks, including the senior, German-educated, leadership of the General Staff, who had great influence over the King.\n\nThe situation was complicated by several other factors. King Constantine's wife Queen Sofia was the sister of the German Kaiser, Wilhelm II, while Constantine himself had been educated in Germany and admired German culture. In contrast, Greece had an ongoing mutual defense pact with Serbia, a member of the Allied forces, who were asking for support after they were invaded by Austria-Hungary (see Serbian Campaign (World War I)).\n\nThe King's personal links gave him an obvious bias towards supporting the Central Powers. However, he believed it was in the greater interests of Greece to remain neutral \u2013 especially as long as there was no obvious victor in the war. On the other hand the Prime Minister Venizelos was in favor of joining the Entente, as he believed that Greece would gain new lands and fulfill the Megali Idea.\n\nIn January 1915, in an attempt to convince the Greeks to side with them, Britain offered Greece post-war concessions in Asia Minor (currently part of Turkey). Venizelos felt this was a good deal and attempted to force a bill through the Greek parliament to join the Allies. Staunch opposition by the King, Army generals and their supporters forced Venizelos to resign shortly afterwards (on March, 6).","subreddit_id":"t5_2y3jq","subreddit":"100yearsago"}

{"body":"Have the next part. Translation of the constitution taken from Wikisource; and the explanation is even looser than before, as I'm seriously lacking the necessary vocabulary of political philosophy.\n\n# **Martial Law**\n\nThe requirements for the state of war are defined in *Article 68 of the Imperial Constitution*. It has the following wording:\n\n&gt; The Emperor shall have the power, **if the public security of the Empire demand it**, to declare martial law in any part thereof, until the publication of a law regulating the grounds, the form of announcement, and the effects of such a declaration, the provisions of the Prussian law of June 4, 1851, shall be substituted therefor.\n\nThe Emperor is entitled to the right to declare martial law. The *effects* of the declaration of martial law are, according to [Laband](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Laband): With the proclamation of the declaration of martial law, the **executive powers are transferred to the military supreme command**. *The civil service and administration* are bound to *obey the military*. Consequently, all civil authorities become ancillary to the military commanders; their orders are to be executed without consideration or examination of their legal permissibility; the unconditional duty to obey relieves civil authorities of their responsibility for the legality of their orders. This duty is personally carried by the responsible commanders.\n\n*Military personnel* under siege are bound by the same laws as during the state of war; the garrison commander holds jurisdiction over all his military personnel. Certain *criminal acts* carry harder punishments if committed under martial law. Additionally, *court martials* can be set up; their provisions however must be explicitly stated in the declaration of martial law, or announced in a separate, appropriately titled order. These laws do not apply to Bavaria. As per a special statute of 1892, particular provisions apply to preparing martial law in [*Elsa\u00df-Lothringen*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alsace-Lorraine).\n\nThe *form of the announcement* of martial law is dicated by \u00a73 of the Prussian law of 1851:\n\n&gt; The declaration of martial law shall be announced by **drums and trumpets** and minutes to the municipal authorities, by posting to public places, and shall be publicized without delay. The abolition of martial law shall be published in municipal announcements and newspapers.\n\nTo the *effects* it shall be noted that the declaration of martial law results in the introduction of a *temporary military dictatorship*. This suspends the provisions of \u00a736 of the Prussian constitution and equivalents of other state constitutions, which restrict the use of military force for suppression of *civil unrest* to specific conditions and require explicit request by civil authorities.\n\n# **Interruption of telegraphic communications in Germany**\n\nAccording to the main telegraphy office and stock exchange telegraphy office, messages to the following destinations are expected to be delayed:\n\n* one to two hours to Frankfurt, Hamburg, Stra\u00dfburg\n\n* over two hours to Breslau, Danzig, Emden, Britain, Hannover, Italy, Pozan, Switzerland, Cologne, Koblenz, Erfurt, Insterburg, Freiburg, Heringsdorf, Munich, Stralsund, Stuttgart\n\n# **Interruption of German shipping**\n\n*(Cable of our correspondent)*\n\n\\# Hamburg, July 31^st .\n\n**All Hamburg shipping companies have instructed their ships on the high seas *to immediately call at the nearest port* and await further instructions. *No ship will depart* from Hamburg today.**\n\n**Hamburg**, July 30^th . Under consideration of the *political situation*, tomorrow's *departure of the [steamer Imperator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Imperator)* has been *postponed*. \n\n[The HAPAG steamer \"Vaterland\" is delaying its return voyage.](/r/100yearsago/comments/2c21pt/july_29_the_worlds_largest_ship_passenger_liner/)\n\n\u2b1c Munich, July 31^st .\n\nIn the light of attempts of price increases by individual grocers, the *Lord Mayor of Munich* explained during today's magistrates' conference that the food supply of Munich was secure and prepared for a mobilization. There was *plenty of livestock* and *sufficient grains*. Appropriate measures would be implement by the magistrate should the situation deteriorate.\n\n*****\n\n## Random notes and observations:\n\n* It's interesting how martial law immediately transfers all power to the military. At least German schools tend to depict it as if the military initially had little power, and only Ludendorff and Hindenburg managed to \"subdue\" the Kaiser and \"forced\" him to let them ruin Germany.\n\n* That \"duty to obey\" would come to haunt Germany. It was abolished after 1945.\n\n* It's interesting how all these provisions deal directly with municipal authorities. Modern German speaking countries are federalized to a high degree, we'd have at least two or three layers of administration between them and the military supreme command.\n\n* Two hours delay for international telegrams? I wonder how the SMS network would hold up under similar conditions\u2026\n\n* War profiteering started before the war itself. Capitalism, ho! About half a million civilians in Germany would eventually starve, most in the bitter winter of 1917. \n\n**Edit**: Whoops, omitted a few cables.","subreddit_id":"t5_2y3jq","subreddit":"100yearsago"}

{"body":"You might not want to tell people to look this up in an Arabic dictionary, as some will actually define it as holy war, haha.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\n&gt; In Modern Standard Arabic, the term jihad is used for a struggle for causes, both religious and secular. The Hans Wehr Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic defines the term as \"fight, battle; jihad, holy war (against the infidels, as a religious duty)\".\n\nBut anyway, I think you are wrong on a semantic level either way. This is simply because sure, jihad *can* have different definitions depending on the context, but this *was* the context of war.\n\nNow we simply have to look at the definition of *holy war* - this is a war in which there are religious differences that are a good part of the reason for the war. From Wikipedia:\n\n&gt; A religious war or holy war (Latin: bellum sacrum) is a war primarily caused or justified by differences in religion.\n\nAnd now jihad, again from Wikipedia:\n\n&gt; Within the context of the classical Islamic law, it refers to *struggle against those who do not believe in the Islamic God (Allah)* and do not acknowledge the submission to Muslims, and so is often translated as \"Holy War\", although this term is controversial.\n\nSo it's controversial, sure, especially when you  consider it used in a context outside of actual warfare - but look at the emphasis (mine), it's clearly related to differences of religion. He wouldn't have declared jihad if the reason wasn't religion.\n\nSo put 2 and 2 together:\n\njihad (religious difference) + war (as the context Mehmed V used \"jihad\" in) = holy war\n\nPretty much by definition.\n\nThis doesn't mean to say that jihad *always means* holy war, but it does mean that when Mehmed V said it in the context of an actual physical war, it infers the actual definition of holy war, so it's not incorrect to use the term in this context, just not in every context, surely?","subreddit_id":"t5_2y3jq","subreddit":"100yearsago"}

Various countries also had war bonds and loans in the Second World War. If you read an old WW2 era American comic, you can hardly go two pages without Captain Marvel or someone shouting at you to buy war bonds. \n\nSo I suppose the answer to your question is that it made people feel better because if they bought the war bonds it helped to fund the war and thus helped to bring their side closer to winning.

It was a war that ended the long standing but completely retarded form of government known as Imperialism.\n\nI'd hesitate to call Imperialism a form of government, rather a system of relations between unequal nations, but it's a little immaterial here.  Unless you're one of those who believes that WW2 was nothing more than the final scene of WW1 it's hard to see WW1 as the end of Imperialism.  Indeed, the infamous Treaty of Versailles expanded French and English Imperial territory.  Granted the fact that soldiers from the Empire fought and died for the homeland and in doing so created their own national identity might have been a contributing factor, but WW2 was the actual death knell for Imperialism, as Britain sold her Empire to finance her defense.  \n\n&gt; Brought democracy to more of the world, \n\nBrought Democracy to a few places in Europe.  Lenin and his friends say hi by the way.\n\n&gt;and ended an oppressive empire of 600 years. But yeah, other than those major world shattering things it was a total waste.\n\nYeah, it brought the Kaiser, the Archduke, the Tsar and the Sultan low.  But that which ultimately replaced them was not much better.  It would take another horrible conflict to resolve those issues....","subreddit_id":"t5_2y3jq","subreddit":"100yearsago"}

The state militia is gone today. But its two-and-a-half-month stay allowed mine officials to withdraw recognition from two competing unions and depose the town's Socialist mayor and sheriff.\n\nThe Western Federation of Miners local began to crumble in March of 1912 when it failed to challenge Anaconda Copper's firing of several hundred Socialist miners. In June of this year, 4,000 insurgents finally split with the miners federation, accusing it off stuffing ballot boxes and packing meeting halls with company men. The rebels blew up the old union hall and chased union president Charles Moyer out of town. But he met with Governor Stewart, and troops arrived soon after. Moyer insists he did not urge armed intervention. But the federation's leadership has shown its frontier activism is far from revolutionary\". \n\nSource; Chronicle of America, Chronicle Comm., 1989.

In one corner of the Western Front, where the British Tommy in his trench was only a few yards from the Boche in his, the war came to a halt, briefly, on this day of Christ's birth.\n\nA Second Lieutenant of the Royal Field Artillery raised his head above the parapet and was astonished to see British and German soldiers standing in the open and making no attempt to shoot at each other. \n\nThe lieutenant met another officer and together they walked along the line as Germans waved and called out.

The city would remain officially under martial law until 1921 - the longest period of military occupation in the country's history since Reconstruction.\n\n&gt;See also: http://mtstandard.com/news/local/butte-in-no-martial-law-declared-in/article_317a164a-24e9-11e4-9a3f-001a4bcf887a.html,  http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83025316/1914-09-03/ed-1/seq-1/, http://www.counterpunch.org/2005/03/26/when-governor-samuel-venus-stewart-declared-martial-law-in-montana/, http://www.marxists.org/archive/debs/works/1914/0801-debs-butteminersaffair.pdf","subreddit_id":"t5_2y3jq","subreddit":"100yearsago"}

{"body":"Because of the [1839 Treaty of London](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_London_\\(1839\\)) (not to be confused with other Treaties of London, like [the secret 1915 one between Italy and the Triple Entente](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_London_\\(1915\\))), where, in exchange for assured Belgian independence from Netherlands after the [Belgian Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Revolution), Luxembourg would get independence from Belgium (though many historians say it was de facto a puppet state of Netherlands). \n\nEdit: The Treaty of London did a few other things too, like ensure Belgian neutrality by its signers - which lasted until the German invasion of Belgium in WWI (which broke the treaty as Germany, or [German Confederation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Confederation) at the time, was a signer), which led to Britain, another signer, formally declaring war on August 4th, 1914. Britain still probably would've got involved if not for the Treaty (it was already sending troops iirc), but it was a legitimate justification which helped cause its populace become more supportive of the war (see [this recruitment poster](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/The_Scrap_of_Paper_-_Enlist_Today.jpg/640px-The_Scrap_of_Paper_-_Enlist_Today.jpg) from 1914).\n\nEdit2: The Treaty of London is also the \"treaty\" referred to by [this diagram of WWI sides](http://i.imgur.com/7Oh0HRM.jpg), I believe (though I could be wrong, the dates are incorrect - it could be referring to some other treaty).","subreddit_id":"t5_2y3jq","subreddit":"100yearsago"}

There must certainly have been a stubbornness inherent in the command especially when there seems to have been armies throughout the world who specialized their uniform/ tactics to the specific conflict. I could be wrong but hadn't the British already serviced the tan uniform with a pith helmet in other endeavors?  The US seems to have adapted their uniform for specific climates as well. I also think that a uniform would definitely matter in trench warfare. Obviously a plume sticking out of a trench would give the specific position of the enemy soldier away even when the general position was known. Also, the ease of sighting a target would increase due to colorful uniforms. Firing a machine-gun effectively still requires finding, fixing and destroying a target before moving on to the next. If I was behind one of those guns I would certainly appreciate a brightly colored uniform contrasting against the landscape. ","subreddit_id":"t5_2y3jq","subreddit":"100yearsago"}

This is why I'm protesting you and this warfare, which is, thanks to the course of action of our enemies, \nthe most barbaric that history knows. While you have used this cruel type of warfare, the Belgian government \nhas encouraged the participation of the civil population in the fight and prepared it for a long time. \nThe cruelties that have been committed, even by clerics and women in this guerrilla army, on our medical personal, \nwounded soldiers and nurses (They were killed when a military hospital was attacked with gunfire), left my Generals with no other choice but to initiate all necessary steps in order to punish the people responsible and to stop the bloodthirsty population from continuing \nthese murders and evil acts. Some villages, even the old city L\u00f6wen, with the exception of the old townhouse, had to be destroyed in order \nto protect ourselves and the troops.

In [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language), the word *jih\u0101d* is a noun meaning \"struggle\" or \"resisting\". A person engaged in jihad is called a *[mujahid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mujahid)*, the plural of which is [mujahideen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mujahideen). The word *jihad* appears frequently in the [Quran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran),   often in the idiomatic expression \"striving in the way of God *(al-jihad fi sabil [Allah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allah))*\".   \n\n&gt;Muslims and scholars do not all agree on its definition. Within the context of the classical Islamic law, it refers to struggle against those who do not believe in the [Islamic God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_God) ([Allah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allah)) and do not acknowledge the submission to Muslims,  and so is often translated as \"Holy War\",    although this term is controversial.  According to the *Dictionary of Islam*  and Islamic historian [Bernard Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Lewis), in the large majority of cases jihad has a military meaning.  Javed Ghamidi states that there is consensus amongst Islamic scholars that the concept of jihad will always include armed struggle against wrong doers.  It was generally supposed that the order for a general war could only be given by the [Caliph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliph) (an office that was claimed by the Ottoman sultans), but Muslims who did not acknowledge the spiritual authority of the Caliphate (which has been vacant since 1923)\u2014such as non-Sunnis and non-Ottoman Muslim states\u2014always looked to their own rulers for the proclamation of a jihad. There has been in fact no universal warfare by Muslims on non-believers since the early caliphate. Some proclaimed Jihad by claiming themselves as [mahdi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahdi), e.g. the Sudanese [Mahommed Ahmad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahommed_Ahmad) in 1882. \n\n&gt;Others have given the word wider definitions. Many observers\u2014both Muslim  and non-Muslim \u2014talk of jihad having two meanings: an inner spiritual struggle\u2014the \"greater jihad\"; and an outer physical struggle against the enemies of Islam\u2014the \"lesser jihad\"  \u2014which may take a violent or non-violent form. \n\n&gt;Jihad is an important religious duty for Muslims. A minority among the [Sunni scholars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni_Islam) sometimes refer to this duty as the sixth [pillar of Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Pillars_of_Islam), though it occupies no such official status.  In [Twelver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelver) [Shi'a Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shi%27a_Islam), however, Jihad is one of the ten [Practices of the Religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practices_of_the_Religion). \n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/gc0dnia.png) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Fula_jihad_states_map_general_c1830.png)\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Jihadism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jihadism) ^| [^Salafi ^jihadism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salafi_jihadism) ^| [^Offensive ^jihad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_jihad) ^| [^Al-Jihad ^\\(Baghdad)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Jihad_\\(Baghdad\\)) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cm2b6e1) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cm2b6e1)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)","subreddit_id":"t5_2y3jq","subreddit":"100yearsago"}

This would continue for years.  Heck, it even happened in WWII.\n\nBut eventually most the German subculture in the US purposely choose to give up their German-ness in WWI.

{"body":"&gt; Can someone give me a little background on the fonts?\n\n*Fraktur* was the common font family for Germanic languages at the time, while *Antiqua* were used for other Western European languages. [Mixing them to denote loan words](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Initialen.jpg) was not uncommon, and works in German were [set in Fraktur](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Communist-manifesto.png) even outside Germany (note that the address is in Antiqua!).\n\n&gt; Why is it necessary to have different fonts for each language? Or does it have nothing to do with the language but with the fact that it's a quote, like we would use italics nowadays?\n\nIf you look closely, each paragraph is set in a different font, even the German ones (compare the d, e.g.), so I assume it's both: A different Fraktur font for the German quote, and an Antiqua font for French quotes.\n\n&gt; why is its usage almost nonexistent nowadays? Why was it abandoned? \n\nIt gradually fell out of favour starting with the 1870s, with the increasing globalisation of the times. Antiqua was considered more \"modern\", \"clean\" and cosmopolitan, and popular especially in scientific contexts (due to Latin, Greek and French being used a lot, which were set in Antiqua anyway). This gained momentum in the 1920s, together with all the other artistic (r)evolutions of the time (Bauhaus style etc.).\n\nThe Nazis zig-zagged it. At first, Antiqua was outlawed for being Jewish; then it was reintroduced for publications designed for foreign readers (occupied Europa was unruly enough without having to train all those slaves how to read Fraktur); then *Fraktur* was outlawed for being\u2026 uh\u2026 Jewish, mainly because of rationalisation efforts.\n\nAfter the war, few publications returned to Fraktur, mainly because Antiqua is easier to read and industrially typeset, and it stopped being taught in schools, which reduced its appeal even more \u2013 a vicious cycle that led to the quick end of Fraktur sometimes in the late 1950s.","subreddit_id":"t5_2y3jq","subreddit":"100yearsago"}

{"body":"Check out Dan Carlin's Hardcore History podcast for the 3-hour long (and fascinating) explanation, but essentially - probably, but not forever. \n\nGermany was on the rise and beginning to act like a major power. The established powers weren't too fond of it, and tried restricting Germany in various ways. It's hard to imagine no conflict ever happening unless the other powers learned to share. The end result was that the other powers believed waiting would only make Germany stronger, while Germany (rightly) felt surrounded by countries that didn't want it to get stronger. \n\nSomething probably would've happened eventually, but basically Germany believed its only shot at survival was to conquer France before Russian troops reached German soil, and to be ready. It was called the [Schlieffen Plan](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlieffen_Plan). When Russian troops mobilized, Germany believed that trying to avert war was already futile because to wait would mean it had no chance at winning. \n\nAgain, I highly recommend Hard core History if this type of stuff interests you.

The battle, fought at night with just 12,000 yards between the fleets, practically eliminates German sea power except in the Baltic and North Sea.\n\nThe officially neutral American navy is said to be jubilant and Argentina, too, is rejoicing at the British success.

The war at sea, which has been raging for three months now, took a decisive turn last night, with the German and British fleets concluding a running battle that has taken them a long way from home.\n\nThe decisive encounter was fought off the Falkland Islands, when under cover of nightfall, the two fleets came within six miles (9.6 kilometres) of each other. In a fierce battle the Royal Navy sank four of the finest German cruisers, the *Dresden*, the *Nurnberg*, the *Scharnhorst* and the *Gneisenau*, with no British losses. The Royal Navy is chasing the remaining German light cruisers, hoping to turn victory into rout.\n\nUS officials say that the government will be delighted. Although the US is officially neutral, it has been seriously worried by the spread of the sea war into Atlantic waters and by the fire-power of some modern cruisers. The victory will enable the Royal Navy to concentrate its resources on the battle in the North Sea. The picture is far less rosy there.\n\nThe German submarine fleet is still a constant danger to British ships, with its deadly torpedoes extracting a heavy toll. There is an additional hazard there from the mines which the Germans have laid extensively, using merchant ships as well as navy vessels\". ","subreddit_id":"t5_2y3jq","subreddit":"100yearsago"}

{"body":"New machines rain death from the sky\n\nParis, 16 December. As the big battalions fight a war of attrition on the western front, aerial combat in the skies above- where individual fighter-pilots fight one-on-one battles under almost medieval rules of chivalry- is forcing strategists to reappraise their ideas of what is possible. \n\nInitially only reconnaissance missions were flown, but soon airmen of both sides were using grenades and hand-held bombs against the men in the trenches. One aircraft has already shot down another, and over Rheims yesterday a British pilot fired his revolver to dissuade a German aviator from dropping a bomb on the city. With an eye on the German's superior airship technology, strategists speculate as to what will happen if a Zeppelin bombs central London and whether it will cause mass panic. Another risk of what some call \"air power\" is the insertion behind the lines of spies and assassins. A picture is emerging of warfare without rules\".

{"body":"\"Pasadena, 31 October\n\nD.W. Griffith has now finished *The Birth of a Nation*, a film unlike any other. The scenario, based on two of Thomas Dixon's stories, *The Clansman* and *The Leopard's Spots*, concerns the history of two different families, the northern Stonemans and the southern Camerons. Griffith's intention was to recount the whole truth regarding the War of Secesssion in order to rehabilitate the Southerners. This was an ambitious and expensive project, financed by the Mutual Film Corporation and its head Harry E. Aitkin. The final cost was over $100,000, but the film had gone over budget, and only loans from friends permitted its completion. The shooting of the film was done mainly at the Reliance-Majestic studio in Pasadena, California and lasted nine weeks. The number of war scenes, for which Griffith needed approximately 500 extras, often take place where the actual battles occurred. Perched on a 10-metre high tower, Griffith gave out his orders like a great military strategist. When the noise of the cavalry and the booming of cannons grew louder, the instructions were totally inaudible. Extras placed at more than three kilometres from the camera were directed with the aid of mirrors and luminous signs. During the shooting, Griffith made constant use of Matthew Brady's Civil War photographs for historical reference. For example, the surrender of General Lee at Appomatox, the signing of the proclamation freeing the slaves, and Sherman's march to the sea have been very faithfully reconstructed from some of the negatives. He also had to recreate the interior of Ford's Theater where President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated. Lincoln is played by a near-perfect double, Joseph Henabery, while Raoul Walsh with a revolver in hand, is the reincarnated personification of the murderer, John Wilkes Booth. One of the most spectacular scenes is the uprising of the riders of the Ku Klux Klan towards the climax of the film. For this sequence, Griffith had a hole dug under the place where the horses passed by, so that he could film the clamoring hoofs at ground level\".\n\nSource: Cinema Year by Year.

{"body":"&gt;Irish neutrality in the two wars cost both Britain and those individuals deeply.\n\nIt's very hard to say that Ireland was neutral in WWI when it was part of the United Kingdom at the time, and the Irish nationalist politician John Redmond (mentioned in the articles above) is credited with successfully motivating up to 140,000 members of the paramilitary National Volunteers to join the British army:\n\n&gt;The interests of Ireland\u2014of the whole of Ireland\u2014are at stake in this war. This war is undertaken in the defence of the highest principles of religion and morality and right, and it would be a disgrace for ever to our country and a reproach to her manhood and a denial of the lessons of her history if young Ireland confined their efforts to remaining at home to defend the shores of Ireland from an unlikely invasion, and to shrinking from the duty of proving on the field of battle that gallantry and courage which has distinguished our race all through its history.\n\nThings did change and Irish opinion towards the war and towards Britain rapidly deteriorated after 1914, but the island was not neutral.","subreddit_id":"t5_2y3jq","subreddit":"100yearsago"}

{"body":"At its root it was a balance of power issue.\n\n[Germany was still a new-ish state](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_of_Germany) at this point, but it was already becoming the dominant power on the continent, causing the whole French vs English thing to undergo a pretty extreme re-evaluation. Germany was also pushing to become involved on the global stage, by building a modern navy (more modern than the English at the start), and trying to get in on the colonial gold rush.\n\nSo there is a pretty extreme cold war/arms race going on on the continent, and everyone is allying with everyone else. The Kaiser is being [somewhat of a bully as well](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agadir_Crisis#Moroccan_Rebellion) which isn't helping anything.\n\nSo there is all this buildup and popular sentiment toward war. Everyone was fueling it with propaganda, to a point, but as things start coming to a head the heads of state start trying to take a step back.\n\nBy then it's too late. The Austro-Hungarians pick a fight with the Serbs, the Russians come in on behalf of the Serbs, the Germans tell the Russians to demobilize or else, and then declare war without even waiting for an answer, etc, etc, etc.\n\nThe assassination of the Archduke Ferdinand is often cited as the cause for the war, but really it's just a spark in a gunpowder factory full of nutjobs running around with hammers. *Something* would have started it. \n\nThe whole thing went to shit almost immediately. The Sino-Japanese war had proved the defensive primacy of the machine gun, but no one in Europe paid any attention to things happening on that side of the world, so they got to learn for themselves that it was basically impossible to beat a trench line without tanks. \n\nThe war was (initially) very popular, so many many many people signed up, and then got marched into the machine guns of the other side. So many people died it became politically impossible to stop fighting, and many many more people got to have the same experience. They opened new fronts, which quickly turned into new quagmires.\n\nThen the US jumps in, and makes it so one side can actually *win*, which sets up [Versailles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles), which levies massive putative damages on Germany for being part of a war that everyone kinda wanted, and opens the door for a rematch in a few years.","subreddit_id":"t5_2y3jq","subreddit":"100yearsago"}

However, it was this male chauvinism that actually proved Henriette Caillaux's best friend during the proceedings. **She was defended by the prominent attorney Fernand Labori who convinced the jury that her crime, which she did not deny, was not a premeditated act but that her uncontrollable female emotions resulted in a crime of passion.

I mean, yeah, they did have Russia breathing down their necks, but still, they pretty much let themselves get defeated by an enemy which was effectively five times weaker than them, and that's without accounting for the war exhaustion and the technological inferiority of Serbia. I think that is bad decision making of miraculous calibre.\n\nEDIT: I should probably expand on the miraculously bad decision making. First off, the Serbs didn't even have enough rifles to equip their standing army. The best course of action would have probably been to swiftly crush the Serbs with a show of superior force and then deal with the Russians from the north. That was certainly attempted. However, this was screwed up by several bad decisions, among them these three which I can explain best. First off, the aforementioned reservists, a good deal of which were conscripted from regions sympathetic with the Serbs. Like, a quarter of them. Now, I understand that AH might have thought that reservists were sufficient, but there when a quarter of your army is likely to desert? Yeah, bad idea there. Second, AH got a bit overzealous. See the [Battle of Cer] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cer) for more info. Third, AH severely underestimated the morale of Serbs, for lack of a better term. Now, I wouldn't put this under the miraculously bad decision making if AH didn't have previous experience during the previous 20-30 years of tension with Serbia.\n\nTL;DR: T'was a clusterfuck.

{"body":"That latin letters (font is called antiqua then) are much more easy to read is a false conclusion. This depends comepletely on the reader. I once read an article that Fraktur is faster to read than Antiqua if you are experienced.  \n  \nNot only newspapers were printed in fraktur. Any German print-product was. I have a dictionary in Fraktur at home from 1923. Fraktur was once also used in other nations but it only sustained in Germany. It went so far that French and Latin words as well as foreign names (that often occured in German texts) were printed in Antiqua and not in Fraktur such that Fraktur was only a 'priviledge' for German words. This is not based on racism, but instead on the fact that Fraktur was highly specialized on German. It had the ligatures and letters (e.g. long-s) that the German language needes.   \n  \nUp until Hitler had forbidden the usage of Fraktur, it just was the right font for German. It was also more modern than Antiqua and more artistically.   \n  \nAditionally it corresponded with German Handwriting (Kurrent and S\u00fctterlin) which was again different from English handwriting and is unreadable for most people today that haven't put some time in learning. The handwriting you used everyday fit perfectly with the printing-font.  \n  \nYou see there were many good reasons to use the font. Personally I think it is a shame thaty Hitler forbid it and that the allied troops kept this law (they couldn't read it and did not want a 'secret German font'). It was a huge part of German culture.","subreddit_id":"t5_2y3jq","subreddit":"100yearsago"}

Farrell MacDonald. It was [written](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenwriter) by [L. Frank Baum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._Frank_Baum) and [produced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer) by Baum and [composer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composer) [Louis F. Gottschalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_F._Gottschalk). The film is an [adaptation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_adaptation) of Baum's [novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel), *[Queen Zixi of Ix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Zixi_of_Ix)*.\n\n&gt;The film had severe [distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_distributor) problems, owing to the box office failure of *[The Patchwork Girl of Oz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Patchwork_Girl_of_Oz_(1914_film\\))*. Advertisements claimed that the film would be released September 28, 1914, by [Paramount Pictures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures), but this apparently never occurred, though it was apparently released in its entirety in 1917. It was eventually reduced from a five-reel film to two two-reel films known as *The Magic Cloak* and *The Witch Queen*. The current prints are assembled from these two films, and so the film is incomplete. All of its titles are missing, and *The Magic Cloak* title card, which is not in [The Oz Film Manufacturing Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oz_Film_Manufacturing_Company) style, is used without any additional credits. Its only [allusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allusion) to [Oz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_of_Oz) is a title card's claim that the fairies of Burzee are \"fairies of Oz\".\n\n&gt;[Intertitles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertitle) confirm that the cast included [Violet MacMillan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violet_MacMillan) as Timothy, or __Bud__, who becomes king of [Noland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noland_(Oz\\)) due to a legal loophole; [Mildred Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mildred_Harris) as his sister, Margaret, or __Fluff__; [Fred Woodward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Woodward) as Nicodemus, the [mule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mule), and possibly some other animals as well, and [Vivian Reed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivian_Reed_(silent_film_actress\\)) as Quavo, the minstrel. After [Juanita Hansen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juanita_Hansen) became better known, the fact that she portrayed the title role, Queen Zixi, was mentioned in many contemporary sources. [The International Wizard of Oz Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_International_Wizard_of_Oz_Club) published Scott Andrew Hutchins' \"An Oz Filmography\" on their website, and in an edited form in the Spring 2004 issue of *[The Baum Bugle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Baum_Bugle)*, in which he postulated several other members of the *Oz* stock company in other roles. This information was submitted by a third party to the [Internet Movie Database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Movie_Database) and has been accepted by some commentators as fact,  although there is no contemporary evidence of this.\n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/5gWrKIs.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Magic_Cloak_of_Oz_\\(1914\\).webm)\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^The ^Oz ^Film ^Manufacturing ^Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oz_Film_Manufacturing_Company) ^| [^Queen ^Zixi ^of ^Ix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Zixi_of_Ix) ^| [^L. ^Frank ^Baum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._Frank_Baum) ^| [^Mildred ^Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mildred_Harris) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+ckujhrt) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+ckujhrt)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)","subreddit_id":"t5_2y3jq","subreddit":"100yearsago"}

I remember reading something about they promised 500,000 troops on the front by the dawn of 1918, but they had something like 110,000, with no heavy equipment. The Allies were actually really annoyed with America because they were promised specific numbers and locations and they didn't happen. There was a lot of resentment amongst troops on the front who heard stories of the Americans coming to help them out but didn't turn up. Even when they did turn up, their lack of training of modern tactics (Which isn't entirely fair, considering *modern* training changed every 6 months as combat tactics evolved so rapidly on the front, especially as armoured warfare came in, and combined arms operations became available with better communication methods) led to a lot of fucked uo operations. One particular example I can't remember the name of was when the Australians went into battle with the Americans and the Americans fucked up their artillery patterns so bad they ended up firing on allied forces, which caused mass panic, and then an actual rout, which left a lot of Australian infantry in no-mans-ground.","subreddit_id":"t5_2y3jq","subreddit":"100yearsago"}

{"body":"Ironically (?) The US is the oldest State in the world. The vast majority recognize a country by the government that claims power over it, they recognize the capital that that government names, they recognize the laws and borders that that government says enforces. When a revolution happens, or a takeover, that State ceases to exist.\n\nAnd by that measurement, the US is the oldest. The Russian Federation (\"Russia\") is less than 30 years old. \"China\" only goes back to the 1940s, and most European States don't even go back to the 19th century.\n\nNow, if you want the play the \"but there was another government there BEFORE and before that and beyond, and China is 5,000 years old, well guess what, there were dudes 10,000 years ago in the territory now claimed by the US. Yet you wouldn't go ahead and say that that makes the US 10,000 years old.\n\nJust saying. If people universally didn't place so much weight on the governments of States, and universally use the borders that those States came up with, maybe you could credibly claim the \"I come from a very very old country\" shit. But since the only people who flush that government=country shit down the toilet are anarchists, and they are like 1% of the world's people, well...\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2y3jq","subreddit":"100yearsago"}

{"body":"Also: \"Belgian cities fall to German troops. Oct.19.\n\nSince the great battles of the rivers last month, the front has shifted from France to Flanders as each side, recoiling from frontal attacks on entrenched positions, has sought to manoeuvre round the other's exposed wing. The response in every case has been more digging of trenches; and so the German and Anglo-French forces have steadily worked their way northwards to the Channel coast. \n\nIn the process the Germans set out to consolidate their position in Belgium; so Ghent, Bruges and Ostend have fallen, and the Belgian government has fled to France.\n\nKing Albert, with his Field Army and some British troops, was besieged in Antwerp and under bombardment. The port was finally taken on October 9; the Belgian force escaped after blowing up the forts, but about 1,000 British were forced to retreat into neutral Holland.\n\nAs the war of movement gave way to the quite new and unexpected trenches, a fierce struggle developed for key positions. On the British front in Flanders it was the town of Ypres, which the British Tommy was soon calling Wipers. Despite repeated and heavy German blows, the British held on, and the trench barrier from the Swiss border to the sea was completed.\n\nWith the appearance of a German aeroplane over Paris last week, another unanticipated dimension has been added to the war. The plane arrived soon after midday on Sunday, when the boulevards and the Champs Elysees were crowded. Field glasses were produced in an attempt to follow the hide-and-seek that ensued when a French biplane gave chase. There were several explosions from the bombs dropped by the German before he took cover in thick cloud.\n\nIt is still too soon to be sure that the other aerial menace, the Zeppelin, can be banished, but hopes have been raised by the news that Sir Hiram Maxim, the American-born inventor of the machine gun, who became a British citizen, has devised an incendiary bullet to ignite the Zeppelin's gases.\n\nReports reaching Amsterdam from Berlin say that the Socialist newspaper Vorwarts has incensed the authorities by publishing an article warning the bourgeois press against publishing misleading reports of Austrian victories\".

Big important events will always pop up to the top. \n\nThen I do a Google image search on the date. This can often lead to the discovery information ignored in the image search. \n\nWhen I get a hit on something I like to research it more to find the best source for it. \n\nIf I make a post it's because I think it's interesting. Not every day is going to have a major WWI battle. And, in fact, when I started contributing to this sub, it was a few months before the 100th anniversary of WWI. \n\nPeople like what they can relate to. So, in addition to the obvious WWI stuff, I like to post things that demonstrate \"the way we were\" so to speak. An example of a really successful post not related to the war was one about the World Series. \n\nFurther, here as with anywhere on reddit, image posts do really well, so I try to find good ones. \n\nI also have a few gotos in terms of finding content. Blogs that do a 100 years ago theme and the NYTimes.com archive. \n\nOne thing I put the most effort into is finding posts are are \"meta\" in that they'll appeal to other subreddits, like /r/TheWayWeWere, /r/HistoryPorn, /r/PropagandaPosters, /r/history, /r/baseball, /r/music, /r/unitedkingdom, and others. Those are a few examples of subs that I have cross posted to. Then I cross post the content with a tag in the title that says it was cross posted from here, that way I can raise awareness of this sub to other communities on reddit who would be interested in our content. \n\n\n&gt; Motivation behind posting: What kinds of pleasures do you feel you personally gain from actively contributing / viewing the /100yearsago subreddit? Are you personally interested by history / WWI as a subject?  Do / did you study it, or is it more of a hobbyist interest? Are you motivated by the notion of contributing to a unique kind of archive?\n\nI really enjoy finding the content. To me it's a challenge and I get to learn stuff. That's another thing I really enjoy about this sub is learning stuff I didn't know. \n\nWWI as a topic is woefully ignored in media and pop culture. There are no best selling WWI games, and there is no WWI version of Saving Private Ryan. The first world war just isn't as sexy as the second. There's no evil villain. In many ways, WWI was the last war motivated by the traditional reasons for waging war. \n\nI think the lack of interest in WWI as a subject is so overlooked because of how complex it is. One thing that was really interesting to watch in this sub is how all of the different countries joined the war. There was like two weeks where almost every day it was the 100th anniversary of another country joining the war. \n\nTo put it one way, WWI is to WWII as Star Wars: Episode I is to Star Wars: Episode IV. It's a lot of politics and not a lot of action. \n\nSo, what do I get out if it? The same thing I get out of all of reddit. I am addicted to karma as if it were crack. The only thing maybe more addicting is orangereds. \n\nOf course, as mentioned, I get knowledge and enjoyment out of hunting down and finding interesting things to share. \n\nI also get a lot of sanctification from helping to build a sub that people like. I mentioned cross posts earlier. They are a super effective tool to build a community on reddit. For example, two days ago I started /r/WhereIsMyFlyingCar. Today it's trending on reddit, which is 100 percent due to cross posts. \n\nThis sub has been able to go trending twice. In fact, it's one of the most impressive feats of going trending I've ever seen. It went from a few hundred members to almost 10,000 all on the strength of a comment mention in /r/todayilearned. The only sub I've seen go trending faster /r/thefappening when that whole fiasco went down. \n\n\nNo, I haven't studied the WWI era more so than any American has in the course of a normal education. And yes, I love that this sub will one day be an archive that students and other people interested in history can browse and search. That is /u/DanyalEscaped's original intent with the sub. \n\n\n&gt; Feelings of community: To what extent do you feel there is a sense of established community within this subreddit? What kinds of posts are you more likely to upvote? Which are you more likely to downvote or ignore?\n\nThe community is still new. This is a sub where there's more interest in learning information, I think, which means there's not a lot of discussion. Low discussion means low community. But more and more people are commenting, and more and more a I start to recognize a lot of users.  \n\nThe fact that this sub is so successful I think is also a testament to the reddit and the greater reddit community. Reddit often gets a bad name for circlejerks and some bad subs, but really reddit is an amazing place. If it weren't, and if there weren't people interested in history and culture, the this sub could not exist. \n\nI never downvote a thing in this sub. I upvote everything. I rarely downvote in reddit. I am a strong believer in courtesy upvotes. I am only likely to ignore a post if it's something that I think I know a lot about, which isn't often. \n\nI think that answers all of your questions. \n\nFeel free to ask me any follow-ups.

It also makes corporate officers personally responsible for antitrust violations.\n\nBut what has caused the unionist Samuel Gompers to hail the act as \"the Magna Charta of American labor\" are the provisions that exclude unions and agricultural co-operatives from laws against combinations in restraint of trade.

The Russian army, while large, was poorly trained and struggled with optimizing supply routes.  The Germans were simply caught off guard by the speed in which the Russians arrived.  While Germany ultimately sent troops from the Western including General Ludendorff, the commanders on the Eastern front notified Berlin additional troops were not necessary and the situation was under control.  That message was somehow lost, the troops were sent to the east anyways, and when they arrived they basically had nothing to do.  \n\nThe Schlieffen Plan only failed because it was not fully executed.

{"body":"I've translated the first column. The translation is a bit loose, but I wanted to be finished before Christmas. I might translate the rest later, but right now I'm a bit drained. Emphasis and bold as in the original (even though it doesn't seem to make sense most of the time), hyperlinks obviously not. I have no idea what the \"Molsssche Bureau\" is (or what its actual name is), but it appears to be a telegraph news agency from the single mention of it I found via Google.\n\n# **Germany declared to be in a state of war**\n\nThis afternoon, the Situation has been *dramatically* escalated by two developments. It has been reported that **Russia was about to fully mobilize their army and fleet**. At the same time suspicions arose that the negotiations, orchestrated by Berlin to achieve a peaceful agreement between Austria-Hungary and Russia, would remain fruitless. Russia demands, we assume, that Austria-Hungary not only should not raise any *territorial* claims \u2014 Austria-Hungary has declared from the beginning it would seek territorial extension \u2014, but Russia also demands that Austria-Hungary *commits themselves to honour the Serbian sovereignty*. An enquiry to Vienna about these matters has *not been answered* to this hour, and the official Austrian stance is that any negotiations in this direction shall be futile. Such a commitment would negate any chance for Austria-Hungary to gain something from this war, and would deny it the necessary protection against the [Great Serbian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Serbia) threat.\n\nAdditional reports from this morning clearly show that Russia's affirmations the mobilization was solely aimed against Austria-Hungary, not *Germany*, were untrue. According to these reports, Russia had been undertaking extensive war preparation efforts along the *German* border, and was rapidly progressing. Due to these developments, leaders of the Army, Navy and Foreign Ministy have been called to a *conference* in the [*Reich Chancellery*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reich_Chancellery). The conference took until 1 a.m., and naturally had a grave atmosphere. A crowd had assembled before the Chencellery, their attention caught by the arriving automobiles and carriages, and looked up to the windows in anticipation, rightfully assuming that important decisions were made behind them. Immediately after the end of the conference we were informed that, according to [Article 68 of the constitution](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_German_Empire#XI._MILITARY_AFFAIRS_OF_THE_EMPIRE), *Germany has been declared to be at the state of war*, which, however, does not imply a mobilization. The *Kaiser* will move his imperial residence from Potsdam to Berlin this afternoon. We spread the news in Berlin with a special edition, a print run of several hundred thousand copies, where it naturally greatly moved the audience. Some time later, the Molss' Bureau published the decree as follows:\n\n&gt; We received word of the *German ambassador in St Petersburg* that the *full mobilization of the Russian Army and Fleet has been ordered*. Accordingly, His Imperial Majesty the *Kaiser* has ordered *a state of impending threat of war*. His majesty will relocate to Berlin today.\n\nA further official note published by the Bureau renders the announcement thus:\n\n&gt; His Imperial Majesty the Kaiser have declared the state of war according to Article 68 of the Imperial Constitution for the whole Imperial Territory *except Bavaria*. An equivalent declaration has been made for *Bavaria*.\n\nWe also want to add a message received from official Austro-Hungarian diplomatic sources. The message that **the full mobilisation of the Austro-Hungarian army is imminent**.\n\nWe will address the legal and practical implications of the declaration of war further below. Again, this is not a mobilization, but immediately preceeds one. Russia and her allies must not doubt Germany's *firm determination to not withdraw in the face of Russia's threats*, and that Germany, despite its deep-rooted love of peace, will take the necessary, ultimate measures. We all perceive the war looming over us as a terrible calamity, befalling hundred of thousands of peaceful people. But everyone in Germany is ready to carry out their duty.\n\n\\* * *\n\n*****\n\n## Random notes and observations:\n\n* The war propaganda is already in full force. Grab a copy of *Falsehood in War-Time* and tick off the list.\n\n* The first industrialized war was kicked off by people who still drove horse carriages. Ah, the irony.\n\n\nEdit: Several typos.\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2y3jq","subreddit":"100yearsago"}

Sheridan thinks that Morgan meant to hit him with the dirt and swings at the player catching him on the jaw. Ainsmith then leads a charge out of the dugout and punches the ump as both teams rush out. Ainsmith and Morgan are ejected and as they are walking by the box seats\u201a a fan calls Ainsmith a name. Eddie leans in and asks him to repeat it\u201a and when the fan does\u201a the catcher decks him\u201a starting a near riot. Morgan jumps into the stands as does Bull Henry\u201a who gets hit in the back with a chair. Eventually calm is restored\u201a but the game is delayed 15 minutes. Shaw wild pitches in a Tiger run in the 10th to give Detroit a 3-2 win. Harry Coveleski is the winner\u201a allowing 3 hits and striking out 11.","subreddit_id":"t5_2y3jq","subreddit":"100yearsago"}

It is an 8\u00a0mm [bolt action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolt_action) infantry [rifle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle) that entered service in the French Army in 1887. It is a repeating rifle that can hold eight rounds in its forestock tube magazine, one round in the transporter plus one round in the chamber. The Lebel rifle had the distinction of being the first military firearm to use [smokeless powder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smokeless_powder) ammunition. The new gunpowder, \"*[Poudre B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poudre_B)*\", was [nitrocellulose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrocellulose)-based and had been invented in 1884 by French chemist [Paul Vieille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Vieille). Lt. Colonel [Nicolas Lebel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Lebel) contributed a flat nosed 8\u00a0mm [full metal jacket bullet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_metal_jacket_bullet) (\"*Balle M*\", or \"*Balle Lebel*\"). Twelve years later, in 1898, a solid [brass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brass) pointed ([spitzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitzer)) and [boat-tail bullet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boat-tail_bullet) called \"*Balle D*\" was retained for all 8mm Lebel ammunition. Each case was protected against accidental percussion inside the tube magazine by a primer cover and by a circular groove around the primer cup which caught the tip of the following pointed bullet. Featuring an oversized bolt with front locking lugs and a massive receiver, the Lebel rifle was a durable design capable of long range performance. In spite of early obsolete features, such as its tube magazine and the shape of [8mm Lebel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8mm_Lebel) rimmed ammunition, the Lebel rifle remained the basic weapon of French line infantry during World War I (1914\u20131918). Altogether, three million four hundred and fifty thousand (3,450,000) Lebel rifles were produced by the three French State factories between 1887 and 1916. \n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/b1A5ddN.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Rifles1905-2.jpg)\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Berthier ^carbine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berthier_carbine) ^| [^8mm ^Lebel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8mm_Lebel) ^| [^Bolt ^action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolt_action) ^| [^Mauser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauser) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+clwvyz8) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+clwvyz8)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)","subreddit_id":"t5_2y3jq","subreddit":"100yearsago"}

The alliance was created as part of a joint-cooperative effort that would strengthen and modernize the ailing Ottoman military, as well as provide Germany safe passage into neighboring [British](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland) colonies.\n\n&gt;On the eve of the [First World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War), the Ottoman Empire was in ruinous shape. As a result of subsequent wars fought in this period, territories were lost, the economy was in shambles and people were demoralized and tired. What the Empire needed was time to recover and to carry out reforms; however, there was no time, because the world was sliding into war and the Ottoman Empire was highly unlikely to manage to remain outside the coming conflict. Since staying neutral and focusing on recovery did not appear to be possible, the Empire had to ally with one or the other camp, because, after the [Italo-Turkish War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italo-Turkish_War) and [Balkan Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan_Wars), it was completely out of resources. There were not adequate quantities of weaponry and machinery left; and neither did the Empire have the financial means to purchase new ones. The only option for the Sublime Port was to establish an alliance with a European power; and at first it did not really matter which one that would be. As [Talat Pa\u015fa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talaat_Pasha), the Minister of Interior, wrote in his memoirs: \u201cTurkey needed to join one of the country groups so that it could organize its domestic administration, strengthen and maintain its commerce and industry, expand its railroads, in short to survive and to preserve its existence.\u201d\n\n&gt;The problem was that most European powers were not keen to conclude an alliance with the ailing Ottoman Empire. Already at the beginning of the Turko-Italian War in Northern Africa, the [Grand Vizier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Vizier) Sait Halim Pa\u015fa had expressed the government\u2019s desire, and the Turkish ambassadors were asked to find out whether the European capitals would be interested. Only Russia seemed to have an interest \u2013 however, under conditions that would have amounted a Russian protectorate on the Ottoman lands. It was impossible to reconcile an alliance with the French: as France's main ally was [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire), the long-time enemy of the Ottoman Empire since the [War of 1828](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Turkish_War_(1828%E2%80%9329\\)). Great Britain declined an Ottoman request.\n\n&gt;The Ottoman Sultan [Mehmed V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmed_V) specifically wanted the Empire to remain a [non-belligerent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-belligerent) nation. However pressure from some of Mehmed's senior advisors led the Empire to align with the Central Powers. Whilst Great Britain was unenthusiastic about aligning with the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire) Germany was enthusiastic.\n\n&gt;Germany needed the Ottoman Empire on its side. The [Orient Express](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orient_Express) had run directly to [Constantinople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople) since 1889, and prior to the First World War the Sultan had consented to a plan to extend it through [Anatolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia) to [Baghdad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad) under German auspices. This would strengthen the Ottoman Empire's link with industrialised Europe, while also giving Germany easier access to its African [colonies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_colonial_empire) and to trade markets in [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_India). To keep the Ottoman Empire from joining the [Triple Entente](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Entente), Germany encouraged [Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Romania) and [Bulgaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Bulgaria) to enter the [Central Powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Powers).\n\n&gt;A secret treaty was concluded between the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire) and the German Empire on August 2, 1914. The [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire) was to enter the war on the side of the [Central Powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Powers) one day after the German Empire declared war on Russia.  The alliance was ratified on 2 August by many high ranking Ottoman officials, including [Grand Vizier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Vizier) [Said Halim Pasha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Said_Halim_Pasha), the Minister of War [Enver Pasha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enver_Pasha), the Interior Minister [Talat Pasha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talat_Pasha), and Head of Parliament Halil Bey.\n\n&gt;However, there was no signature from the [House of Osman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Osman) as the Sultan [Mehmed V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmed_V) did not sign it. The Sultan was the Commander-in-Chief of the [Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Army), as written in the constitution, this made the legitimacy of the Alliance questionable. This meant that the army was not be able to fight on behalf of the Sultan. The Sultan himself had wanted the Empire to remain [neutral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrality_(international_relations\\)). He did not wish to command a war himself and as such left the Cabinet to do much of his bidding. The third member of the cabinet of the Three Pashas [Djemal Pasha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djemal_Pasha) also did not sign the treaty as he had tried to form an alliance with France. The Alliance was not universally accepted by all parts of the Ottoman government (see below Geoffrey Miller \"Turkey enters the war\").\n\n&gt;The [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire) did not enter the war until German elements in the [Ottoman Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Navy) took matters into their own hands and bombarded Russian ports on the 29th of October 1914.\n\n&gt;\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Central ^Powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Powers) ^| [^World ^War ^I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I) ^| [^Enver ^Pasha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enver_Pasha) ^| [^Middle ^Eastern ^theatre ^of ^World ^War ^I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Eastern_theatre_of_World_War_I) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cjngxpu) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cjngxpu)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)","subreddit_id":"t5_2y3jq","subreddit":"100yearsago"}

It began on Friday 2 April 1982 when [Argentina invaded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982_invasion_of_the_Falkland_Islands) and [occupied the Falkland Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_the_Falkland_Islands) (and, [the following day, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_South_Georgia)) in an attempt to establish [the sovereignty it had long claimed over them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falkland_Islands_sovereignty_dispute). On 5 April, the British government dispatched a naval [task force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_force) to engage the [Argentine Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_Navy) and [Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_Air_Force) before making an [amphibious assault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphibious_warfare) on the islands. The conflict lasted 74 days and ended with the Argentine surrender on 14 June 1982, returning the islands to British control. 649 Argentine military personnel, 255 British military personnel and three Falkland Islanders died during the hostilities.\n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/E8ybM9d.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Jorge_Anaya.JPG)\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Argentine ^air ^forces ^in ^the ^Falklands ^War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_air_forces_in_the_Falklands_War) ^| [^Lockheed ^P-2 ^Neptune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_P-2_Neptune) ^| [^A\u00e9rospatiale ^Alouette ^III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%C3%A9rospatiale_Alouette_III) ^| [^Rapier ^\\(missile)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapier_\\(missile\\)) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cji0hxq) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cji0hxq)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)","subreddit_id":"t5_2y3jq","subreddit":"100yearsago"}

{"body":"\"New York, 28 December\n\nWinsor McCay has created a new cartoon heroine, Gertie the Dinosaur, whose adventures are the toast of the town. The inspiration sprung from an approach made to the artist by the American Historical Society to draw pictures of prehistoric animals. This is the first of McCay's animated films to have a detailed background, all of which has been created by the hand of John Fitzsimmons. Gertie makes a shy debut, peering from behind some boulders. But she soon asserts herself as she devours trees, rocks and fruit, then drinks a lake dry, tosses a mammoth over her shoulder and dances. When she is admonished for her boisterous behaviour, she bursts into tears, melting the stoniest of hearts. The cartoon is accompanied by a live action sequence in which McCay and some of his cronies visit New York's Museum of Natural History and prowl through the dinosaur exhibits. Later, resplendent in tuxedoes, they visit a restaurant where McCay bets that he can make a dinosaur movie and sets to work drawing. Gertie has also become part of McCay's stage act. He invites Gertie to eat an apple which he holds up. She lowers her neck and swallows the fruit to the delight of the audience.\"\n\nSource: Cinema Year-By-Year 1894-2002.

The 24-year-old actor is bidding farewell to Keystone, where he enjoyed his first success in the movies. When his contract with Keystone's boss Mack Sennett came up for renewal, Chaplin demanded a raise from $175 to $1,000 a week. Sennett replied with a counteroffer of a three-year contract at $500 in the first year, rising to $1,500 in the third, but Chaplin had already decided that it was time to move on. Essanay, which up till now has thrived on a diet of Anderson's Broncho Billy Westerns, has offered him $1,250 a week plus a $10,000 bonus. In addition Anderson and Spoor have promised Chaplin complete artistic control of his films, of which he will be the star. Chaplin has truly come a long way in a year. With 35 Keystone films behind him, 23 of which he directed himself, he has already created his own comic universe. Now he will be exchanging the balmy climate of sunny California for breezy Chicago where Essenay are still making films in their original studio\". \n\nSource: Cinema Year by Year 1894-2002.

The soldiers lived in horrible conditions and were just getting nowhere fast on the battlefields.\n\nSo there they were, Christmas Eve., and morale wasnt particularly high. So for Christmas, soldiers on each side were singing with one another to pass what was essentially a really sad night, away from their families with no guarantee of ever returning home. And so as soldiers from both sides sang and created their own festivities, it became apparent to each other that they were doing eethe same thing, across the trenches.\n\nSo eventually, you had the two sides singing with each other. After a while, I suppose they all felt safe enough to emerge from their trenches and not spend that night hiding from one another. \n\nThats why I find this story so beautiful. In the midst of the greatest war in human history until then, human nature bought together enemy armies, through language and political barriers, to just spend a night with each other.

The insinuation is that they had to learn to cheer the King from the French.\n* In the second cartoon, the humor comes from the fact that no enemy would pronounce himself an enemy to a guard.\n* In the third cartoon, a German spy (using passenger pigeons to send messages) denounces a pair of boys for spying on him. (In effect, a spy complaining about spying.)\n* In the fourth cartoon, the joke is that hunting with the hounds is entertainment. It's the equivalent of saying that they're just keeping the seat warm.\n* In the fifth, the joke is that a layabout is asking who will do the work -- since he certainly won't.\n* In the sixth, the joke is obvious.\n* The seventh is satirical -- Prince Wilhelm was believed to be a lightweight partier.\n* In the eighth, contrast the \"Good Girl\" with her desire to fill German cigarettes with gunpowder.\n* In the ninth, the \"patriotic\" flag waver criticizes the boy whose shirt he stole -- while still being fully dressed himself.\n* In the 10th, the joke is that a battle doesn't need a scheduled place.\n* In the 11th, the joke is that \"German\" was an epithet in Britain during the war years. German shops were smashed, German immigrants harassed.\n* In the 12th, the humor comes from the contrast between the fancy party and its surroundings in what looks like a cramped coal cellar. Conversely, it could be a play on overblown fears of zeppelin attack.\n* No idea on the 13th.\n* On the 14th, the dachshund is Germany, leading the Ottoman Empire toward a cliff.","subreddit_id":"t5_2y3jq","subreddit":"100yearsago"}

{"body":"&gt;Sorry\n\nYou're fine.\n\n&gt;I literally just copied it straight from the \"Chronicle of the 20th century\" book\n\nThe book was published back in the 80s, a time at which the situation was different because Muslims were #1 buddies with the west thanks to the war with the Russians. Before then there was a lot of tension, but not enough will to properly translate the term and define it in English. Afterwards, as Al-Qaida escalated their act against the US specifically, Muslims were side-stepping talking about the details of Jihad to people in the west. Jihad was still thought of as \"that thing Muslims did while killing the commies.\" Once 9-11 came along, the topic became very difficult to talk about because everyone wants to not be marked or anything.\n\nThe accumulation of this was this created a situation where we, Muslims, didn't define the word well enough in other languages than Arabic and used general terms without making clear when Islam considers war legal. Such clarity is crucial in this context because a hadith specifies that \"fighting for Allah's name to be triumphant is in the way of Allah,\" as opposed to other things that were mentioned like for the sake of a tribe or for honor ... etc. and when you violate what justifies war in Islam then you're violating God's commandments and therefore not fighting in the way of Allah.\n\nI understand that the sultan himself declared Jihad, which anyone can. However, their declaration doesn't change the definition, and neither make war holy. War is never holy in Islam. In fact, it's something to be avoided, and if started, stopped as soon as possible.

The Belgian forces in Antwerp conducted three sorties in late September and early October, which interrupted German plans to send troops to France, where reinforcements were needed to counter the French armies and the [British Expeditionary Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Expeditionary_Force_(World_War_I\\)) (\"BEF\").\n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/gMLqzB2.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Belgian_defense_in_Antwerp.jpg)\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^German ^invasion ^of ^Belgium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_invasion_of_Belgium) ^| [^Race ^to ^the ^Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_to_the_Sea) ^| [^Battle ^of ^the ^Yser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Yser) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+ckulep9) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+ckulep9)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)","subreddit_id":"t5_2y3jq","subreddit":"100yearsago"}

{"body":"Inconsequential news item on that front page about the Senators-Tigers game. Looked it up elsewhere and found this:\n\nJul 30, 1914 - A wild melee mars the Tigers 3-2 win over the Senators. With the score tied in the 9th\u201a the Nats Ray Morgan seemingly beats out a grounder when he slides into 1B\u201a but umpire Sheridan calls him out. Morgan comes up with a handful of dirt\u201a which he throws at the ump's feet. (\"This happens in nearly every game.\" Washington Post). Sheridan thinks that Morgan meant to hit him with the dirt and swings at the player catching him on the jaw. Ainsmith then leads a charge out of the dugout and punches the ump as both teams rush out. Ainsmith and Morgan are ejected and as they are walking by the box seats\u201a a fan calls Ainsmith a name. Eddie leans in and asks him to repeat it\u201a and when the fan does\u201a the catcher decks him\u201a starting a near riot. Morgan jumps into the stands as does Bull Henry\u201a who gets hit in the back with a chair. Eventually calm is restored\u201a but the game is delayed 15 minutes. Shaw wild pitches in a Tiger run in the 10th to give Detroit a 3-2 win. Harry Coveleski is the winner\u201a allowing 3 hits and striking out 11.\n\nSome perspective: That Detroit team? It featured Ty Cobb.\n\n\nEdit: Thank you for the gold! Too kind. These kinds of juxtapositions in history have always fascinated me. Wherever you're from, your history is naturally slanted and centered around there.

It was adopted as Deployment Plan *Aufmarsch I* in 1905 (later *Aufmarsch I West*) and modelled a Franco-German war which would not involve Russia but was expected to include Italy and Austria-Hungary as German allies. \"[Schlieffen] did not think that the French would necessarily adopt a defensive strategy\" in such a war, even though their troops would be outnumbered \"but he recognized that this would be their best option and it therefore became the central theme of his analysis.\"  Consequently, *Aufmarsch I* stated that Germany would have to go on the offensive to end this kind of war (on favourable terms) and in it, all of the German army was deployed on the German-Belgian border so it could launch an offensive into France through the southern Dutch province of Maastricht, Belgium, and Luxembourg. The deployment plan assumed that Italian and Austro-Hungarian troops would defend Alsace-Lorraine. \n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/GDOEw1i.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Alfred_Graf_von_Schlieffen.jpg) - *Count Alfred von Schlieffen*\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^German ^General ^Staff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_General_Staff) ^| [^Helmuth ^von ^Moltke ^the ^Younger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmuth_von_Moltke_the_Younger) ^| [^Plan ^XVII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_XVII) ^| [^Alfred ^von ^Schlieffen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_von_Schlieffen) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cjce25z) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cjce25z)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)","subreddit_id":"t5_2y3jq","subreddit":"100yearsago"}
