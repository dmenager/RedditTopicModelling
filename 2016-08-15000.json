{"body":"Firstly, you need to integrate trade into your mix of incomes. When I play a treasure-ridden map, an early market allows me to use the treasure reward as I see fit.\n\nSecondly, resource scarcity is kind of the whole point of conflict! A lot of 0ad is about strategic placement. Even if you can't make it far enough to reach a spot of wood, you might be able to build a civic centre near enough to place towers or even a fortress on a nearby hill or cliff. These take stones (usually very readily available on wood-scarce maps) to build. You can then prevent the AI from accessing the resource with a more minimal human cost than with troops. You can also let the AI take the territory over and then invade immediately with your troops, to cause them damage while they are spread out across two bases. Now that you can steal buildings, this has become a super viable strategy!","subreddit_id":"t5_2sbet","subreddit":"0ad"}
{"body":"I can't really think of an AoE-style RTS with morale in it at all. RTTs like Total War are trying to simulate battles, so naturally morale plays a huge role, but in games where the economy and combat take place simultaneously, the relative unpredictability of morale can create immense imbalances. I can remember Stronghold having a \"morale\" system of sorts, but this came in the form of certain decorative features also adding a \"Fear Factor\" bonus which either increased or decreased attack strength in exchange for lower or greater resource gathering rate, respectively.","subreddit_id":"t5_2sbet","subreddit":"0ad"}

In one version, I'm not sure if the current version, they had a minimum attack range and would therefore automatically fall back when units got too close, making micromanagement easier.\n\nSword cavalry are good against buildings (iirc), a decent force are good for surprising your enemy and taking down a building or two, assuming they aren't defending with infantry spearmen. They're also not inexpensive.\n\nThere are probably better strategies out there but that's how I use them.\n\nAlso I like chariot archers but I feel like in practice cavalry skirmishers and other archers/units would beat them.

Before keto I didn't even think that this was a possibility.\n\nI had been doing really good about keeping my diet simple recently and had been seeing good progress and reduced hunger (I think) from that, but this week I kind of went overboard.  I saw the recipe for Keto Oreos and had all the ingredients on hand.  They were actually pretty good, although I wouldn't use erythritol again for the frosting, the cooling effect is too much for me.  On the brightside I have been able to stick to eating only 1 or 2 of them a day.  And then last night I found Halo Top for the first time after keeping an eye out for the past 6 months.  I had tried Arctic Zero and So Delicious but found them to be not worth it and they both sat in my freezer until they finally got thrown away.  So I tried not to get my hopes up but oh my god, I honestly can't believe how good that stuff is.  I got lemon cake and tried that first, and I'm not usually a big lemon person, more of a chocolate lover, but it was amazing.  I also had a serving of the mint chip later on and that was quite good also, lacking a bit in the chocolate chips but I made up for that by using one of my Ket-Oreos to turn it into mint oreo.  I know my tastes have changed on keto but I would honestly not know that this wasn't a full-sugar ice cream.  The best was that I was easily able to stick to 1 serving of each ice cream so it was only 120 calories.  I will not be making a habit of eating these every day, but damn it is nice to know that there's an ice cream option.","subreddit_id":"t5_34au7","subreddit":"100DaysofKeto"}

{"body":"That's exactly why I do it. Having ADHD has always made completing large tasks seem absolutely impossible. Losing weight always seemed like such a pipe dream. The amount I wanted to lose was so overwhelming, I was always defeated before I had gotten past the first month.\n\nLearning more about ADHD and ways to cope, I learned about breaking up large tasks into smaller, easier to complete tasks. It helped with giving me faster rewards that I need in order to keep me from feeling overwhelmed and giving up. So I decided to use this method with my weight loss. :) I make small attainable goals, that I KNOW I can complete, and ignore the big daunting goal. \n\nI also stopped pressuring myself, and started being kinder. Instead of being as strict as possible, giving myself no wiggle room, I started forgiving myself for cheating, or having moments of weakness. This kept me from falling into the same perfectionist traps that would cause me to give up in frustration with myself. I can get right back on plan with my next meal instead of throwing in the towel.\n\nI don't have strict goal dates for these weight goals either. It's just a goal weight and it will get here when it gets here. In the mean time, I'll work as hard as I can while still having fun. If things are too severe I tend to give up too.

{"body":"It looks like you entered something wrong because you have a lot of NaN errors in there (usually happens when javascript tries to divide by zero). Also, set it to sedentary instead of lightly active. It tends to overestimate energy expenditure.\n\nBut in general if you're new - make sure to read the FAQ here: https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq\n\nThe important things to know are that carbs are a _limit_ - which means don't go over 20g net carbs. Protein is a _goal_ which means you should try to meet it every day. This will prevent muscle loss. Fat is also a limit, based on how many calories you want to consume in a day. So if it tells you 140g of fat that doesn't mean you MUST consume 140g of fat - it's usually that if you consume 140g of fat you'll still be in the deficit you enter. More, you'll maintain or gain weight, less, you'll lose faster (but a too high deficit is counter productive).\n\nMost important of all *READ THE ELECTROLYTE GUIDELINES* - you need enough water, sodium, potassium, and magnesium or you will get what we call \"keto flu\" - it's not a disease, but it makes you feel like shit (which is why it's called the flu). It is 100% preventable if you follow the electrolyte guidelines in the FAQ.","subreddit_id":"t5_34au7","subreddit":"100DaysofKeto"}

{"body":"If you've been eating the \"standard american diet\" for most of your life and you just switched over to keto, it means your body still wants carbs to run. The longer you stick with keto the easier it becomes for your body to burn stored fat for energy instead of carbs that you eat. Physiologically I believe this takes time because certain processes in your body have to wake up that have been dormant since you've basically been giving all your body what it needs through food rather than it using your fat stores. In effect, your body has to re-learn certain processes and that takes time.\n\nThat's why for the first few months, especially if you're engaging in heavy activity, your performance may suffer. Your body still wants carbs, but you aren't giving it any so it basically hits a dead end. It takes time for it to adapt.\n\nThis is also why cheating is a bad idea. If you give your body carbs in enough quantity to kick you out of ketosis, it basically \"re-addicts\" those processes and they have to start learning fat adaptation from scratch agian.","subreddit_id":"t5_34au7","subreddit":"100DaysofKeto"}

I had extra exposure and chances and temptations for taking 'just a taste' and it cascaded from there. In the end I had a couple pieces of cake, and a few handfuls of other carb crap, but otherwise stayed on my eating plan. Oh, and here is a picture of the cake and my daughter enjoying it: [cake downfall. ](https://imgur.com/a/9SO5N) \n\nBack on plan this morning, KCKOing.

Whereas with my ZC eating the last two months I basically don't think about my food any more than is necessary. It is a calm, steady, certain presence. And of course the sugar made me feel sick.

It doesn't feel like I'm eating much less, just eating different things.\n\nI did opt for a bit more protein, because I'm actually also exercising quite a bit. I do 15 minutes of intense exercises in the morning (two circuits of the 7 minute workout thing), I try to walk to work and back everyday (total of 8km per day), play squash for at least 45m twice a week, and if i feel like it I watch an episode on my elliptical once or twice a week. Apple's Health app says my average daily activity of resting is about 690 cals.\n\nAs for Thailand; nope never been. I'm not from the USA; I'm from Amsterdam. Haven't seen the inside of a McDonalds in years... :-) But I guess I'll try and stick to keto as much as I can; maybe I'll manage to stay in ketosis despite the temptations.\n\nThanks for the thaipod link!

Today I actually managed to jog for two+ miles straight without stopping to walk!  I'm a slow jogger, so my pace was about 13 minute miles.  So I hit two miles I decided \"Why don't I make it a full 30 minutes?\"  So I ran a bit more.  I think I ended at 2.25 miles jogged straight!  I am on the treadmill for a full hour, so I walked about 2 miles, as well.  Then I had extra time and hung out on a bike for 30 minutes.  I thought I was going to just walk slowly today, as it had been a while and I hadn't eaten much today and I'm PMSing.  I surprised myself.  I love keto, it makes me so much more energetic.

The serving was small for the price but I did say no toast and it was a nice little place. \n\nMy grandma enjoyed her lunch of one pancake/pikelet covered in marscapone, amaretto and chocolate and took the other two home. She does this every time - she always thinks the pancakes will be a small meal and is then shocked when there's three of them even though there's almost always three of them. But she still always orders the pancakes as a lunch/dinner meal whenever she's at a place with pancakes, even though I try and guide her to things I think are more appropriate for her (not keto, this time it was a thing that as a cross between a sausage roll and a beef wellington). I think there must have been a formative small amount of pancakes experience in her childhood.

{"body":"I am struggling, to be honest. I am committed to keto but I'm not sure why this week has been so hard. I was doing lazy-ish keto starting in late June/early July and was eating 1600 calories and between 35-40 g carbs per day. I wasn't seeing much weight loss and decided at the end of July that I needed to get stricter. So I went to the keto calculator on August 1 and got my macros (below). I kept my calories at 1600 since that was actually easy for me to stick to. But this week has been really hard, I'm still eating right around 1600 calories so it must be the carb reduction - I have been absolutely ravenous every day. I'm drinking around 4 to 4.5 litres of water and keeping up on my electrolytes (after an initial mixup where I took too much potassium) so I don't think this is the keto flu, just insatiable hunger. I'm not so much tempted to binge on carbs or \"bad\" foods, I just want more protein and fat than I can fit into my calorie deficit. I have lost 5 pounds this week alone, 10 total since July 1 which I am enjoying and I don't want to screw with my progress so I'm going to stick with it.

Since fat burns at 9 calories per gram, you need much less of it to hit your daily caloric needs on your plan. \n\nIf you are planning on a heavy workout routine, the advice I've received in the ketogains subreddit is to:\n\n* Keep carbs under 25g\n* Eat enough protein to maintain at least 0.8 g/lb lean body mass daily (the recommended level is 1)\n* Attempt to meet a 25% deficit calorically (energy levels can be a serious problem on workout days)\n\nThe issue with my plan is that it is challenging to get 170g of protein, while limiting fat to 100g.  Most animal protein has about a 1 to 1 ratio of protein to fat, so supplementing is necessary for me.  I get 80 grams of my protein from whey, and then the other 90g of protein from animal.  The animal meat gets me to about 85-90g of fat.  This leaves about 10g of fat to be filled with olive oil/butter.","subreddit_id":"t5_34au7","subreddit":"100DaysofKeto"}

He was sternly lectured by 4 different docs at the hospital and told that if he didn't get it together he was going to leave me a widow. He's on insulin now and no matter how lazy I'm feeling, everything I cook at home has to be keto friendly for his sake. I decided to start the diet with him for my own health as well.

{"body":"It sounds a lot like how I've learned to deal with my anxiety/depression.  The perfectionism, impatience, all-or-nothing...  I think some of those disordered thought habits come with lots of different mental health barriers.  I'm enjoying how fast the keto weight is coming off, but trying to be very honest with myself that it is short-term.  I'm going to have stalls and gains and fall on my face at some point.  I've lost before with pure CICO, and it was sometimes this fast, but not usually, but ALWAYS more stressful. The fact that keto just feels right for me is so comfortable, and makes a lot of the mental health stuff kind of take care of itself.   I set myself very conservative goals- I joined the LoseIt 6 week challenge and passed my goal by week 3, even though week 2 was shark week.  When I joined the 100 Days of Keto challenge, I pushed myself a bit more, just because one lb a week would take me to 204, and so I figured- why not 199?  If I make it, cool!  If not, though, who cares?  It's just an Internet challenge where I guessed at my weight loss, not some sort of defining expression of my worth or success.\n\nAnyhow, I just really resonate with what you are saying, with keeping this process as mentally/emotionally healthy as I can.  And you're right- it IS fun, if you don't have crazy expectations.   When you expect some struggle and bad times, the good times are just that much more enjoyable.","subreddit_id":"t5_34au7","subreddit":"100DaysofKeto"}

He was literally on my last nerve. I love the kid, but damn, he can be selfish and his brand of humor is acting like an idiot asshole and thinking its funny, which is literally the opposite of my sense of humor and just pisses me off to no end, which according to him and his friends makes me a stuck up bitch. \n\nAnyway, ranting aside, when we finally go home, my dad had already gone out and bought us dinner. Not one to turn down free food and since my brother was pissing me off, I had spaghetti and a piece of pizza for dinner... I shouldn't have done it, but I did, and I logged my weight this morning.

{"body":"Hey folks!\n\nI'm considering signing up for round 7; have been cutting calories since mid June, tracking full diet since July 7th and discovered and started keto last week Tuesday, and 17/7 IF since three days (used to skipping breakfast anyway). Ketostix say I'm at 0.8 g/l now, haven't felt any flu or other effects at all so far. Went from 87.9 to 79.5, so lost 8.4kg in 8 weeks so far. I'm a 171cm male by the way, and my goal is 70kg. \n\nMy main dilemma is that I have my 40th birthday coming up the 16th, and may celebrate it a bit the 15th. So I guess that will give the 100 days a rough start. To make things worse, I'll be spending 4 weeks in Thailand (part vacation/part work) almost all of September, and from other reading maintaining keto in south-east Asia is near impossible (rice and noodles everywhere).\n\nBut waiting for round 8 is probably not a great idea either; if Keto Calculator is correct, I may have already hit my goal before it starts (depending on Thailand impact I guess)...\n\nSo should I try anyway? Or is it setting myself up for failure?\n\nAlso I can't promise I won't post pictures of paradise, and I'm not sure if that's motivational for the rest of you or not...\n\nReplace this line with your question\n\n---\n*Generated by [Keto Calculator](http://keto-calculator.ankerl.com) 9.9*\n\n39/M/5'7\" | CW 175 | 23% BF | Lightly active\n\n* 1196 kcal Goal, a 42% deficit.

{"body":"TLDR: Just now joining, IF and meals included. Nice to meet you guys. \n\nA little late to the party but im joining you guys! Im 22, a senior in college, this is my last semester and I graduate in May. I have a wandering eye, so in February, ill be getting eye surgery to straighten it then Lasik to correct my vision in June. There is a 10-14 week recovery time, so I want to lose as much weight as possible and remain keto through that time. Ive gone from 250 to 200 in about 6 months with calorie counting and moderate exercise. Then at the beginning of the summer, i went from 200 to 180 with keto and no exercise. Im ready to make this a lifestyle change. I started on the 25th so im 2 days in, and will go an extra 11 days after you guys are finished to hit my 100 days of keto (so, Dec. 3rd is my end date but ill be for sure Keto until I hit my goal weight of 125, ill probably switch to low carb from there). \n\nKeto is okay right now. Im starting 16/8 IF today and I plan on having 2 big bunless bacon cheeseburgers (8oz of 85/15 beef split into 2 patties, muenster cheese, american cheese, 2 slices of maple bacon on each with lettuce. Condiments will be mustard and thousand island dressing). For breakfast ill have some maple bacon and peanut butter with some fried eggs. \n\n I find that logging my meals ahead of time, helps me stay on track. All that food is only 1252 cals,  10g of net carbs, 94g of fat and 94g of protein. A little over on protein but thats okay. My macros are 1400 cals, 70f/25p/5c so its close. \n\nYesterday, I was off work so i meal prepped enough to last me a few days. Chorizo and Cabbage, Chorizo Egg Muffins, Turkey and Broccoli egg muffins, and Pork Sausage with cabbage. I got about 8lbs of ground beef on sale for $15 so ill be eating beef and eggs, burgers, and i may make a small meatloaf this week. ","subreddit_id":"t5_34au7","subreddit":"100DaysofKeto"}

We also lived in the middle of the countryside with the nearest neighbour around 10 miles away so we couldn't even just go next door and ask for food.\n\nIt had an awful effect on my relationship with food, addicted to carbs, associating junk food with happier times (when my mother would be on a \"high\") and that sort of emotional eating when I got older etc etc.  It took a lot to undo that damage and those sort of psychological problems are not easily explained to people who tell you to \"eat less and move more\" and all those other \"well meaning\" tough love phrases.

Tonight birthday dinner with the family, but I checked out the menu ahead of time, and spotted carpacio with lettuce and more steak; I should be fine... :-)\n\nThe last week my weight has actually already dropped below what I remember ever being my lowest adult weight. I'm silly to realize it has taken until my 40th to work up the discipline to shape my body into what I always wanted it to be.","subreddit_id":"t5_34au7","subreddit":"100DaysofKeto"}

So I'd let it consume and before I knew it, I'd given up on myself and turned to old habits to forget what I had done, be it drinking or binge or both. \n\nBut I swear Keto helps me THINK better.  Like, instead of being negative, I'm being logical and taking an active role in this.  For once I feel in CONTROL. It's exhilarating and scary at the same time. I'm used to being on autopilot. Being active at the wheel for this long is really different, and I really enjoy it.

You might be able to find a great deal on an elliptical or a bike if you keep your eye out. \n\nYou could also follow free online workout videos and modify the moves to what works for you. Even if you aren't doing exactly what the instructor is doing, you're still moving and burning calories. And you might be surprised how quickly your joints adapt to the movement after a couple of weeks. I know Jillian Michaels almost always describes a modified version of the exercise (try 30 Day Shred, for example). \n\nJust keep in mind that anything is better than nothing.

Should help a bunch!\n\nBTW - Whiskey &amp; Soda might not be the worst thing in the world depending on what kind of soda. If it was diet, and as long as it was just regular whiskey, you're probably in the clear as far as ketosis is concerned.

And our relay placed first is the women's division (yeah, there were only 3 teams, and we *may* have gotten beaten by the 13 year olds, but they were co-ed so it doesn't matter...). I decided I wanted to do an ocean swim. This swim is only a 1/2 mile, so I should be ok, even with the added waves and stuff that go with swimming in the ocean.\n\nSo, I started back in the pool yesterday and did 1000 yards non stop and I felt great! I'm going back tonight and I'm hoping to get in 2k at least using a little practice book I have. I love how much energy I have on keto. I think once I'm done with the swim in two weeks, I'm going to add in some weight lifting.\n\nMy goal for this summer was to do an open water swim (done!) and my goal for the fall/winter is to do a 5k. Then my goal for next summer is to do a biathlon! The swim I'm doing in the ocean also has a 5k/biathlon option that I really want to participate in next summer!

And if I decide to up the intensity of my resistance training it's a good starting point to put on muscle.\n\nFor the waistline it's a couple of things. Almost 20 years ago when I was 16 I comfortably wore size 30 pants, sometimes size 28.  I've also played around with [waist to height ratios](http://www.health-calc.com/body-composition/waist-to-height-ratio). 0.51 (89cm for me) is meant to be equivalent of a borderline overweight BMI, 0.35 to 0.42 (60.5-73cm) is considered \"[healthy slim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist-to-height_ratio)\"). \n\nMy bodyfat is another contributing factor on how far I've got to go. Abs show up around 12%. I'm still up at about 18-21%. I can still grab a couple of fistfuls of belly fat.\n\nIt's a guess and if I suddenly have abs at an 80cm waist I'll have been wrong and I'll stop.

So hopefully it's only ~0.4kg water weight. But that's very much a wait and see situation.\n\nI'm not really doing it for the weight loss, I'm doing it to see if I can do it. Increased weight loss would be nice but I'm not counting on it. My 100 Days goal is pretty much ignoring this fast and assuming it'll net a similar weight loss than what I'd expect on a regular ~1600 Cal keto diet.\n\nI like the idea of a 5 day fast every three months when in a maintenance phase to generally balance out the odd party or bender.

Lots of escalation and she asked if I wanted a cigarette. We went and from there it sorta imploded. My guess: improper isolation. My friend asked if he could tag along to which I agreed (stupid decision, having 2 guys there made it very friend-zone - maybe i'm over-analyzing..).

To my surprise 30 seconds later, she came back and with her friend! We spoke for a bit but it led nowhere. Didnt really self amuse or escalate - sorta stale interaction and they walked away. Hard with the hot ones, eh?\n\n- Saw a really pretty brunette in a purple dress. Lurked and hesitated for a bit but I did it! Over in about 45 seconds\n\n- Remember K? Well my friend and I ran into her friend. She was looking for K.  We all did shots and I brought her to a nearby couch.

C9, Fnatic, TSM, H2k, Origen-ish, G2, none of them have consistent delays or quality issues like OpTic does.\n\nTerrible reasons for expansion. Halo was because of Flamesword. Hecz picking up ex-Conquest was a complete blind move, it was a decision he made which was influenced by Steve Maida and pressure from fucking Reddit.\n\n\"Family values\" type roster changes, he doesn't hire a manager for his teams and trusts his players to make the right moves, he knows absolutely nothing about the eSports he's in, still mentions Pistola to this day as \"one of the best\".\n\nImaginary problems that don't occur in any other eSport organization. Seriously, CLG, TSM, Fnatic, Luminosity, SK Gaming, who has had problems like OpTic has with apparel, announcements, inability to travel to events.\n\nSocial media? I think it's more than safe to say that OpTic's social media is, by far, and it's not even close, the worst social media management that an eSport organization has ever had, or ever will have, even worse than TSM's in 2015. The fact that a social media manager hasn't been hired for an org this big (in popularity) is absolutely incredible to me.\n\nAnd now this co-owner thing, where Hecz proves once again that staffing is not a part of the OpTic brand, and will continue to function without it.","subreddit_id":"t5_3e98s","subreddit":"100thieves"}

In this case the miner is being tempted by disloyalty personified as a kneeling woman pleading with him to abandon his work. On the road to work stands Britannia, with a sash of patriotism, beckoning him back to the pit head. One of the key questions at this point was the taking (or postponement) of the miners\u2019 August holidays (due to be taken the week beginning Monday 7 August). The coalowners offered to pay all men who worked a full week an additional shilling a day extra. The call to postpone holidays was backed by the Executive Council of the SWMF as well as by Arthur Henderson, President of the Board of Education. A special conference on 5 August voted by 2131 to 802 to accept the postponement.\"","subreddit_id":"t5_2y3jq","subreddit":"100yearsago"}

These women were quickly demobilized when hostilities ceased, and aside from the Nurse Corps the uniformed army and navy became once again exclusively male. The U.S. Army recruited and trained 233 female bilingual telephone operators to work at switchboards near the front in France and sent 50 skilled female stenographers to France to work with the Quartermaster Corps.

{"body":"With the benefit of hindsight, mostly propaganda. \n\nOne of the hidden (lesser known) things about the war is the way the Allies successfully manipulated public opinion, particularly in the United States. At the start of the war, they severed all telecom cables between Germany and the outside world. This meant that telegraph communications had to come through Britain or France, which meant they were heavily censored.\n\nFurthermore, as the war progressed, Britain began intercepting the mail bound for Europe, including to and from neutral countries such as the Netherlands and Norway. Especially after Italy entered the war, this left no way for journalists to provide neutral reporting on the war, since British censors blocked or censored everything that came from Europe to the United States.\n\nThere were very few impartial reports as a result. Radio transmission was about the only way to get news from Germany, but wireless transmissions were frequently jammed, and even without jamming, it had its problems \u2500 the shot from Germany to the United States was a long one and vulnerable to atmospheric effects given the young science of radio communication.","subreddit_id":"t5_2y3jq","subreddit":"100yearsago"}

In 1916 the US was teetering on joining in WW1, a part of the reason to hold back from fully committing to the War was that it seemed pointless to sacrifice our industrial might to commit to a war that was so far across the oceans and 'not our problem.' \n\nHistory overrules this as American Industry thrived during and after the war, propelling us to become a global superpower. But just before committing the AEF (American Expeditionary Force) this would seem like a compelling argument considering the war had nearly bleed all of the economies involved dry. \n\n*Edit* it has been pointed out that there is writing on the prisoners arm that says \"Foreign Competition\". The idea seems to be that industries in the US are thriving off the war (possible as we sold resources to the Allies during the early years of the war) while European industries are being tied up or outright destroyed trying to keep up with the demands of the war effort.  The cartoonist is predicting that times will get rough again in the US once the war ends and the economies in Europe return to their pre-war glory. Thanks to /u/parl and /u/TitoAndronico.

I'm intending to use it for plinking and shooting an appleseed, so I'm a little worried about the reticle being too large for precision shooting at 25m distances, and also parallax at that range since it's not adjustable. Any insight you can give would be awesome!\nThanks!\n\nThe reply:\n\n&gt;It is about perfect at 50 yards where I have it sighted in. Closer in shots at 25 yards are still dead squirrel accurate as are shots out to 100. I haven't really tried it closer, but at distances greater than 100 yards, the drop reticle isn't as reliable as I had hoped. It really depends on the ammunition, light fast loads are better, but the cheap stuff you really can't count on much past 100. That being said, I wouldn't trade it as my plinking scope. It is set and forget, ever time I take the Marlin model 60 out to shoot, it is just easy.\nThis summer I put a Leupold VX-2 3-9x33 rimfire EFR on my son's rifle. He does a lot of shooting at 50 feet and the adjustable focus was really well suited for that. It is in a completely different price range than the primary arms scope though.

It sounds like you want best value or best bang for your buck or something like that.\n\nIn that case, I think it's CCI Blazer. It has the reliability and accuracy of Mini Mags just without the brass coating, and it's cheaper. It's a little hard to find though.\n\nIf you can't find Blazer, then you either have to take a slight step up in quality and get Mini Mag, or you can take a slight step down in quality and get Federal or Remington Golden Bullet or something.\n\nPersonally, I plink with whatever is cheap and doesn't jam every other shot. For me, that's CCI Blazer, Remington Golden Bullet, some types of Federal (but the Champion bulk \"value pack\" sucks IMO), and maybe some Winchester although it does jam slightly more than the others.\n\nI usually try to avoid Remington Thunderbolt because that's just getting a little too far into crap territory.

{"body":"I use a 16 power scope on mine for 100 yards. Open sights are difficult when you're target shooting at those ranges (and hell, even with BUIS on my AR, I couldn't really see the Appleseed targets well enough to get consistent hits in the black, at 25 meters). They're just really a hindrance in this day and age. Sure, you'll be able to hit a pop can every shot, but if you're trying to hit the bullseye, you'll want a scope. \n\nAs far as leaving the current sights, or a red dot, or a scope, or tech sights, the problem is you need to really have a *defined* goal for the weapon.\n\nEach of those options have their ups and downs, but each one excels at a certain area. \n\nOEM/tacsol (Blade) sights: Great at being cheap. They'll 'work', but they're the worst of the bunch for all aspects other than cheap. Middling durability (if you smack them against a tree, they'll probably not break, but probably won't hold zero either).\n\nTech sights: Better open sights than OEM, 2nd cheapest option, peeps are the next evolution of sighting tech over the OEM sights, and there's a reason they stopped making military rifles with blade (oem/tacsol) sights 60 years ago. Best for durability out of all the options.\n\nRed dots: Great for being Fast. Not very accurate. Not very cheap. If you're hunting fast-moving prey that doesn't need a ton of accuracy (Squirrels), then a red dot is great. Lower durability than peeps, probably on-par with oem/tacsol sights.\n\nScopes: Best for accuracy, decent for speed (if you get a lower-powered one), highest cost, lower durability than any of the other options.\n\nSo, for a woods gun or squirrel shooter, I'd get something with a red dot. For a training rifle, I'd do tech sights. For a \"I almost never shoot it\" gun, go cheap with the OEM ones. For a target plinker, use a scope. \n\nIt *REALLY* depends on your intended use.

{"body":"&gt;I could honestly draw up several scenarios in which you'd only have access to one gun. You could too. You know it to be true. Here's just one: You're at a friend's range/club and per range rules all guns not currently being shot must be unloaded, locked back, cased, and locked in your vehicle. Yes, ranges have these rules. You're shooting the 10-22. In comes an active shooter with you holding the rifle and 5rnds in the mag. What do you do?\n\nCan you be real for just a moment? The likelihood of being in an active shooter situation is basically nil. The likelihood of me being at range with such absurd rules is basically nil. The likelihood of the two events occurring simultaneously *is* nil. But I guess you live in a separate reality where such a scenario is something worth considering. I guess you limit the number of rounds you fire through your 10/22 on any given range trip, because as you fire it and it gets gummed up, it becomes less reliable? Best to be sure it will 100% function on the next round! Because God knows, the next active shooter event is right around the corner! Let's be real and not draw on a situation with impossible odds to defend a moot point.

{"body":"&gt; .22 having killed more people than any other caliber is not because of inadequate cleaning.\n\nI didn't imply that.  I pointed out that *because* it is the deadliest bullet, is *exactly* why it is perfectly suitable for self-defense despite what the circle-jerk will tell you.  While one may not purchase it for that purpose, it should always be ready for it.  Because again, *guns are made to kill*; even if it's just used for fun, it was *made to kill*.\n\nI could honestly draw up several scenarios in which you'd only have access to one gun.  You could too.  You know it to be true.  Here's *just one*: You're at a friend's range/club and per range rules all guns not currently being shot must be unloaded, locked back, cased, and locked in your vehicle.  Yes, ranges have these rules.  You're shooting the 10-22.  In comes an active shooter with you holding the rifle and 5rnds in the mag.  What do you do?  If you don't have the imagination to mentally prepare for things like this, you'll never be ready if it happened to you in real life.  The fact that you just laughed (you did) isn't funny, it's concerning.\n\nIf you go through life with your preparations based on you outright excluding possible scenarios, you're gonna have a bad time.  Be open minded.\n\nI'm not preaching cleaning after every trip, but certainly think it should be more often than every few months of regular use.  But no, I don't need to go clean it; because it's already clean and has been since I got home from the last trip.  Burdensome?  Hell no, I make time for what I need to do and have no sympathy for anyone who tells me they don't (have time) because chances are, they're full of shit (and could clean it while they're pushing out another log).","subreddit_id":"t5_2v7cn","subreddit":"1022"}

This is a generalization, but no one is buying a 10/22 for self defense. Not every gun needs to be treated as such. Some guns can be just for fun, and to tell a person they need to clean it after *every* use just because they *might* need to use it in self defense is ludicrous.\n\nI don't disagree that guns shouldn't be kept in good condition. But that wasn't your original argument. Your original argument was that it is unacceptable to go without cleaning a 10/22 for a few months. I even inferred that you think it's necessary to clean a 10/22 after every trip, since that's what you claim to do. If you seriously preach that every gun needs t be cleaned after every use, you're going to shy away a lot of potential new shooters because that is unnecessarily burdensome.

Same size groupings. Multiple trips to the range and I was never able to get the scope zero to consistently agree with the impact point. \n\nThe scope is now in a drawer waiting for my AR build and the 10/22 is sporting a set of Fire Sights and waiting for my next range trip to get zeroed.

I'm thinking I'll be upgrading the stock to a Magpul X22 like everyone else does to give me a more relaxed grip angle. That and I'm invested into MLOK accessories for my AR so I'll be able to swap them back and forth should I need to. \n\nI may also invest in some better glass further down the line. The 3x9 was bought assuming I'd use the gun for hunting and for bench shooting.

Howard could have just snapped at one point, and we missed that point because we entered the story after the fact. The theory that he's the whistleblower (or even adjacent to the whistleblower) contributes to that fact; that his wife and children left him and then died would be enough to emotionally break a person.\n\nI think Howard meant to protect his prisoners, but he did so in an extremist fashion.

All u need is one 5 foot 5, 110 pound girl to destroy a 500 foot, 5000 ton alien beast with one little molotov. Of course this only works when the alien only wants to eat(?) a car instead of just kill the girl, then takes 4 minutes bringing the girl to its mouth, then after exploding, lets her down gently enough to not even give her a bruise. Tell the government to not worry. This little girl has it all under control. She can go alien to alien tossing one perfectly placed molotov into their mouthes, with better accuracy than any pass Joe Montana has ever thrown. \n\nIm sorry the ending was attrocious.

{"body":"To add on to this theory (of which I am in total support!):\n\n1. The loud noises heard by Michelle when she first realized she was in the bunker just before Howard made his appearance could've actually been Emmett in the ventilation shaft watching Michelle. If you listen closely it sounds much more like bowing out of sheets of metal such as that is used in ventilation shafts than of footsteps or Howard moving/walking down the hallway towards Michelle's room (you can hear how much of a difference there is in the two sounds when Howard leaves the room). This also ties into the fact that the loud crash that is heard around this same time frame is in that same hallway which just so happens to be the same hallway the ventilation shaft hatch is found in (watch for the scene where Howard can't open the hatch and notice the gray walls and shelves of food/supplies). This leads me to believe that Emmett was spying/listening to/creeping on Michelle the whole time and just happened to be in the ventilation shaft when Howard came down the hallway to check on her. Emmett didn't have time to climb back down through the hatch before Howard got to the room so he waited till Howard was in the room and proceeded to try to climb down the hatch using the shelving units for quiet support but ended up falling resulting in the crashing of the shelf and supplies. Emmett could've jammed the hatch at any time after this to try to hide the evidence in the ventilation room while still being able to access it himself. I don't think Howard goes into the ventilation room very often as others have noted he takes a minute to even remember the restart sequence not to mention the length of time it might've been since he had been down there recently. The fact that Emmett sleeps under this hatch/ventilation shaft and directly next to one of the walls of Michelle's room when there's more than one perfectly acceptable (and probably more comfortable) couches in the living room also weirded me out.\n\n2. The pictures are of the same girl! Notice the extremely obvious mole on the upper rightt lip... yes it's the same, it's called lighting and teenage angst people. And also anyone else notice the \"school photo\" clothes and the fact that the other photo was a polaroid? I could discount the clothes as a weird farmy hand-me-downs type style but most people I know that were born after the 2000s wouldn't know what a polaroid is let alone have their picture taken in one making me think Emmett's timeframe and story that the girl is actually a missing person from only two years ago highly questionable.\n\n3. After a rewatch and noting that Howard keeps his gun on his right side, it seemed that he almost always kept that side turned away from Emmett but many times in easy reach of Michelle (the dinner table key stealing scene is a great example as well as the bathroom scene). To tie into this when Michelle made a run for the door, Howard recovered just enough from getting hit with the glass bottle to flip the table onto Emmett incapacitating him and then following after Michelle. Why do this at all? Wouldn't you want someone to help stop a deadly dose of radiation or contaminants getting into your bunker if they were able to? I can only assume Howard wanted to make sure Emmett couldn't do anything crazy while he tried to calm Michelle down while also ensuring Emmett couldn't harm Michelle in the process... say to take her hostage and force Howard to give him the gun by either threatening Michelle's safety or the bunker's safety by trying to open the door himself.\n\n4. And finally as a sort of tie in to number 3: Howard's demeanor. His whole face and attitude change drastically when it's just him and Michelle (looking at you stitches scene and a brief scene of them making peanut butter and fluff sandwiches). Michelle even smiles a bit during the stitches scene when Howard is telling her stories of his life making it much too genuine and fatherly a situation than a manipulative or sexual one for me to think that the latter is his intended ultimate goal. Almost every scene with Emmett with Michelle present shows him as being quick to anger, noticing every little movement or glance, and overall being controlling of the situation. Near the end I think Howard appears completely changed (freshly shaved and clothed nicely) because he no longer has to watch Emmett constantly and finally trusts Michelle completely. I think it's also important to note that if Howard did want Michelle as a slave/rape victim in any form, he never once touched her which would seem odd. Even when Howard was all up in her face after the dinner table incident he never once grabbed her arm, shoved her against the wall, or even grabbed her shoulders to emphasize a point. He even tossed the key at her to unlock herself instead of handing it to her when she first met him. His way of being near Michelle also seemed telling in that he always brought a chair in to sit and talk with her in her room if need be or stood a good bit away while giving her personal space whereas Emmett sat uninvited on Michelle's bed right away without even really knowing her instead of sitting on the floor opposite her or asking to sit first.","subreddit_id":"t5_3bw30","subreddit":"10cloverfieldlane"}

Putting something on the hatch would just make the object fall down the stairs/hatch (see National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation lol) not block it from opening. I would think there would have to be a metal tool or rod (or pipe?) somehow inserted to keep the hatch from moving downward and opening. And who's to say Howard didn't have multiple vats of acid down there that Emmett could've used to dispose of Megan's body? I haven't done a rewatch of the killing scene yet to verify but it is certainly possible and could very well be used for inorganic waste disposal since it wouldn't be very smart to try to just dump it with the rest of the trash since it wouldn't degrade very quickly and would probably end up backing up into the bunker (yes I know Howard tried to do just that with the shower curtain but I'll chalk that one up to an essential plot element).","subreddit_id":"t5_3bw30","subreddit":"10cloverfieldlane"}

{"body":"... The concept behind something can be good, while the execution sucks. You can have all the same major plot points happen, without the movie going for stupid videogame logic level bullshit and changing the *whole* tone of the way everything in the movie had been presented thus far, like it did. The entire movie, you're presented with a realistic and grounded representation of events. Everything is gritty, and thus feels *real.*\n\nThen, you get woefully inept aliens that supposedly are *taking over the world,* while they a) aren't smart enough to keep hunting for one person with special troops either made or used for just that (that beast thing) - why the fuck didn't more come to find her, and why did that one beast give up so easily? (and from the perspective of it being a movie - why the fuck did that whole part take *such little time,* why didn't they draw out the chase scene more and turn it into some good suspense rather than literally a handful of tense moments?) - and b) have spaceships that apparently can't take a little fire, while they supposedly *can* cross through the vast vacuum of space, as well as enter other planets' atmospheres. Sure, a molotov is *way* more harsh and damaging to stuff than the vacuum of space, or entering our atmosphere. Right. And it's totally not like after seeing that ending and just how stupid / weak the aliens are, I for the life of me could not imagine the combined might of various nations' military forces having even a *little* trouble with completely destroying the entirety of the alien force without breaking a sweat or receiving too many casualties, right? /s\n\nThe entire way that scene where she took out the ship went was *unbelievably* contrived, incredulous, and illogical. Come on. It looked stupid, and drew me away from the experience. It totally shattered my suspension of disbelief, after the Emmett death scene had drawn me in and had me on the edge of my seat waiting for shit to go down. It ruined the overall movie experience. The whole movie was pretty fucking brilliant, with *amazing* performances from the cast - minus that ending that looked like it was dreamt up by the same guys who storyboard and design / script the \"super cinematic super predictable Michael Bay yo\" sequences from CoD games, where \"you get to be the hero\". That's what that ending felt like - a shoddy, rushed wrapping up of Michelle's character arc:\n\n\"Yeaaahhhh!! She's finally not running away from her problems, so now this *super advanced space-faring alien ship* will totally cooperate in letting the entire audience know just how big a turning point this is and that she's totally a hero by acting *incredibly* stupid, being *incredibly* weak, and not having *any* sort of armament with which to take out *one measly car* without having to grab it with it's tentacles. This super advanced alien ship that can dust the ground with poison, also. Oh that's right, it could have smashed the windows with it's tentacles and chucked out some more of that green fog to kill her. *Oops.* Oh and she totally shouldn't have been slaughtered by that ground-roaming beast already, right? It makes perfect sense that it didn't tear her apart after putting in more effort than *'eyyy, let's see here, here's a person who's still alive, gotta hunt them I guess! Oh shit I lost their trail. Oh well, guess it's time to go fuck off and randomly roam around again!'* \".\n\nAll bullshit videogame logic, style, and enemy behaviour. Nothing grounded or believable, and *far* too many logical holes throughout. After such a great movie that has gone to great lengths to get the viewer invested in the characters, interested, curious as to what the hell's going to happen, and sucked into the film by virtue of it's gritty, realistic portrayal.","subreddit_id":"t5_3bw30","subreddit":"10cloverfieldlane"}

Did Howard abduct her because she was there? Or did he know what was coming and actually rush to get home and knock her off the road? I'm in the camp of, he knew what was coming and was going to the bunker and saw her at the gas station and decided to \"save\" her. Then you have to decide what was the bigger threat. Howard inside or the aliens outside? Would it have been better to stay basically a captive or potentially fight to the death? \n\nI think the ending was great.

{"body":"1) i agree wholeheartedly there are plots holes that can def lead one to believe Emmitt is way more than hes letting on\n\n2)  One possibility is when redoing the script they didnt realize that turning Emmitt from a baddy sort of to a goody  would need to be more clear cut.\nAnd my issue is Trachetenberg says Emmitt was not a bad guy yet okay fine ill go with that. But yet instead of clearing up the whole Megan Brittany issue they choose to basically no comment on it\nWhy not explain to the fans what exactly went on in the bunker with who was there and what happened to them.  Yes they do not have to but there isnt more money to be made here why not at least to some extent give a concrete answer or explanation to this or state the girl in the pic was Megan and or.Brittany.\n\n3) Emmitt helped build the bunker he knew the ins and outs.  When Howard tries to open the hatch its stuck.. fine and well. I still dont belive Howard was small enough to get up there.\nPoint B  When Michelle crawls thru the air vent she reaches the up shaft and stands up. Juding persepctive and size when she stands up in the upshaft  theres no way Howards body could fit in the up shaft unless the camera angle was horrible.\nPoint C  When Michelle enters the vent room again no goddamn way Howard could get thru that entrance. Only way in would be from the top.and we all know its locked from the inside.\nPoint D Emmitt brings up  Brittany  not Howard.  My question is this his sister knew Brittany. Once Emmitt saw the pic wouldnt he realize Howard had killed her and that Michelle was in grave danger. Why didnt he try and kill.Howard.  If i were in that position every alarm bell and whistle would have gone off and i would have used the scissors to kill the guy as soon as i got a chance. Cause lets face it getting out wasnt gonna be easy. \n\nPlus again Emmitt helped build the bunker. When was it was finished  , how long was Brittany down there.   If it was a long period of time why didnt Emmitt notice Howard was gone for that long period of time.  \n\nAlso it appeared Howard had papers and files in the vent room on the table. Why would he leave them there with no real way access them. \n\nAnd if Howard truly didnt want Emmitt in the bunker why didnt he just shoot him or kill.him then while Michelle.was unconscious.   Instead of fighting him some and then allowing him in.  \n\nLot of plot holes whether deliberate or not. Lets face it even these guys probably cant figure out  every scenario  movie goers would imagine and try and explain them all.

{"body":"The Delta Elite stands alone in 1911 10mm's in that it has a ramped frame, not a ramped barrel.\n\nFirst, IMHO Buffalo Bore and Underwood ammo are over spec.  The Delta Elite will handle any reloading book loads just fine.  In addition, Underwood has recently adjusted it's Delta Elite specific recommendations and no longer excludes it from most of their loads.  This furthers my thoughts that they were over book to begin with.\n\nThere are several aftermarket barrel options for the Delta Elite.  They are an improvement over older barrels, but the latest DE's from Colt seem to have better case head support.\n\nFinally, you could choose to have your DE frame cut to accept a ramped barrel from bar-sto, Kart or my personal favorite Schuemann.  This would costs several hundred dollars by the time you pay for the frame cut, the new barrel and fitting of the barrel to the slide/frame.\n\nDurability will be greatly enhanced by running a flat bottom firing pin stop along with a 25lb mainspring (hammer spring).  In my 1911's in 10mm I keep the recoil spring at 18.5 lbs, but I have run as high as 24 lbs.

However, the larger the caliber the greater the potential for disabling an attacking bear with a less than perfect shot. Therefore, the best choice is likely to be the biggest caliber the shooter can handle in a desperate struggle where all shooting will be done one-handed.

{"body":"A 10mm round fired from a gun *with* a suppressor is *much* quieter than a subsonic 9mm round fired from a gun *without* a suppressor. Bullet sonic booms are ~ 140 decibel. Muzzle blast from pistols is typically 157-165 decibels, depending on the caliber, round, and barrel length. Suppressors greatly reduce the sound and energy of the muzzle blast when firing a gun. Subsonic rounds when fired from a suppressor also have no sonic boom, which makes them quieter still (but still loud, unless it's a suppressed 22 LR).\n\n**Approximate db levels based on tests from suppressor companies and other forums**\n- Less is more - \"hearing safe\" at 140 db is completely made up by doctors. Any loud noise can damage your hearing, but when you get close to 140 or higher, you can really mess yourself up. Less is better, and every 3 decibels is a 2x in loudness. Longer barrels reduce muzzle blast slightly, but the biggest benefit of long barrels is to get the muzzle AWAY from your ears, even a long shotgun barrel makes a huge difference vs. a shorter barrel. Sounds levels drop off dramatically with distance. This is why you can stand a few dozen yards from someone firing a .50 BMG and not have a problem, but lose your hearing permanently standing next to the muzzle.\n\n* 163 db: unsuppressed 10mm from 5\" barrel (supersonic)\n* 158 db: unsuppressed 9mm from 5\" barrel (sub and supersonic)\n* 140ish db: suppressed supersonic 10mm from 5\" barrel\n* **140 db hearing safe-ish for a very short time (e.g. length of a single firearm report)**\n* 138ish db: suppressed supersonic 9mm from 5\" barrel\n* 134ish db: suppressed subsonic 9mm from 5\" barrel","subreddit_id":"t5_2uf65","subreddit":"10mm"}

{"body":"&gt;Can full metal jacket .223 /5.56 mm do the job?   All bullets can do the job in some fashion (where the environment allows) but these are not optimal choices when failure is not acceptable.   FMJ in either 55 grain or 62 grain is not my choice as it does not do well on either end of the spectrum.   The bonded or solid copper open tip bullets perform significantly better against hard barriers such as auto sheet metal or glass than the traditional lead core type.\n\nread this:  http://gundata.org/images/fbi-handgun-ballistics.pdf\n\n&gt;All handgun wounds will combine the components of penetration, permanent cavity, and temporary\ncavity to a greater or lesser degree. Fragmentation, on the other hand, does not reliably occur in\nhandgun wounds due to the relatively low velocities of handgun bullets. Fragmentation occurs reliably in\nhigh velocity projectile wounds (impact velocity in excess of 2000 feet per second) inflicted by soft or\nhollow point bullets.10 In such a case, the permanent cavity is stretched so far, and so fast, that tearing\nand rupturing can occur in tissues surrounding the wound channel which were weakened by\nfragmentation damage.\nSince the highest handgun velocities generally do not exceed 1400-1500 feet per second (fps) at the\nmuzzle, reliable fragmentation could only be achieved by constructing a bullet so frangible as to\neliminate any reasonable penetration. Unfortunately, such a bullet will break up too fast to penetrate to\nvital organs. The best example is the Glaser Safety Slug, a projectile designed to break up on impact and\ngenerate a large but shallow temporary cavity. Fackler, when asked to estimate the survival time of\nsomeone shot in the front mid-abdomen with a Glaser slug, responded, \"About three days, and the\ncause of death would be peritonitis.\"\nIn cases where some fragmentation has occurred in handgun wounds, the bullet fragments are generally\nfound within one centimeter of the permanent cavity. \"The velocity of pistol bullets, even of the new\nhigh-velocity loadings, is insufficient to cause the shedding of lead fragments seen with rifle bullets.\"15\nIt is obvious that any additional wounding effect caused by such fragmentation in a handgun wound is\ninconsequential.\nOf the remaining factors, temporary cavity is frequently, and grossly, overrated as a wounding factor\nwhen analyzing wounds.16 Nevertheless, historically it has been used in some cases as the primary\nmeans of assessing the wounding effectiveness of bullets.\n\nthen watch this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXwPtP-KDNk  NSFW unless you work in the medical field and can stare at people on a table with trauma.","subreddit_id":"t5_2uf65","subreddit":"10mm"}

There's a lot of speculation about what was in the letter and whether it held vital information about the assassination. Because of this Hosty decides that Jake must be paid informant, working with the FBI/CIA, because he starts to question who Jake's 'handler' is, and who to contact in order to get it cleared up so Jake can leave. \n\nI think this was covering the theory that the FBI was involved and the mystery surrounding the letter.

{"body":"I think that one thing is for certain and that is that the wormhole is constantly in the present, no matter what year you go into it in. Why I say this is because that whenever Jake tries to change something or be at a place he's not supposed to be, or hear something he's not supposed to hear, the past intervenes and tries to block him out. This proves in a sense that \"the past\" knows what the future is supposed to be like and therefore it tries to block anything that attempts to interefere with making that future happen. It recognizes him as being from the present and therefore tries to stop him. If you go in to the wormhole in 1975 then that is your present, much like it would be in 2016. There is no evidence to suggest that any person who's represented in the past can travel into the future. For instance, there is nothing that says young Sadie can just simply follow Jake into the future. Jake is there to change the past to cause an effect in his present, not bring someone from the past into their future that would also be his present.\n\nIn regards to the ripple effect and Jake just going in to save the Dunning family. This can be explained by the butterfly effect, that any small change, that may seem insignificant, can actually cause massive change in the chain of events that shape the future. But since Jake only went in for one real go into the past and stuck with it all the way to the end, we won't know specifically what any of his actions actually changed, or to put it in other words, which of his actions caused what change. To what extent would the world change if he had just gone back through the wormhole after killing the father of the Dunning family (his name escapes me)? We just don't know. But doing that and also stopping Oswald, obviously puts Harry in a position of being much worse off.","subreddit_id":"t5_3arpq","subreddit":"112263Hulu"}

{"body":"While Stephen King acted as Executive Producer alongside J.J Abrams,  he only reviewed and gave suggestions/input on how to break down the book into the eight teleplays. He almost never wrote a word for the show directly, as that was not his job, nor did he feel that he was the one who could do it best. He ultimately asked the show's developer Bridget Carpenter to take on the task of writing the show and creating a small team of additional writers if she wanted. \n     However, in this case Bridget Carpenter and Stephen King both wrote the poem. Carpenter wrote the baseline poem of \"We did not ask to be in this room. We were invited in. Therefore, because the dark surrounds us, let us turn our faces to the light. Let us endure hardship to be grateful for plenty. We have been given pain to be astounded by joy. We have been given life to deny death. We did not ask to be in this room. But nonetheless we are here.\" \n    Carpenter took the teleplay to King. She requested that he specifically look over the poem, as it was not something from the book. King revised the first line:\n\"We did not ask to be in this room\" to \"We did not ask for this room or this music\" \nand revised the second last line, which is the same, \"we did not ask for this room or this music\" \nand rewrote the ending of the poem to better reflect the setting and situation:\n \"But because we are here, let us dance.\" \nThis incorporated lines/themes from the novel into the poem and helped bring the story to a satisfying close. \n ","subreddit_id":"t5_3arpq","subreddit":"112263Hulu"}

Seven years before the last day, the sea shall submerge Eirin in one inundation. The Order of St. Benedict has said this Pope will come from their order. It is interesting that Jesus gave his apocalyptic prophecy about the end of time from the Mount of Olives. This Pope will reign during the beginning of the tribulation Jesus spoke of. The 111th prophesy is &amp;quot;Gloria Olivae&amp;quot; (The Glory of the Olive). The Order of Saint Benedict has claimed that this pope will come from their ranks. Saint Benedict himself prophesied that before the end of the world his Order, known also as the Olivetans, will triumphantly lead the Catholic Church in its fight against evil. This final Pope will likely be Satan, taking the form of a man named Peter who will gain a worldwide allegiance and adoration. He will be the final antichrist which prophecy students have long foretold. If it were possible, even the very elect would be deceived. The 112th prophesy states: &amp;quot;In the final persecution of the Holy Roman Church there will reign Petrus Romanus, who will feed his flock amid many tribulations; after which the seven-hilled city will be destroyed and the dreadful Judge will judge the people.

Working out (mostly lifting) and eating the right kinds of foods and very likely more food than you have been this past year will help you do that. This will probably be very scary for you. This sub is not appropriate for this stage in your life, but there are many others that can help - r/fitness, r/bodyweightfitness, r/bodybuilding to name a few. They may have members who can help you deal with your new feelings about food and fear of becoming fat again. And you could always search out a professional. \n\nA person of your build - male and tall - should not be eating 1200cal a day. If you plan on working out regularly and lifting heavy, it's very possible you will be eating twice that. The subs I mentioned above have lots of resources to help you figure out the right number for you and all your macros (nutrition). This sub could be helpful to you in suggesting lower calorie alternatives to high calorie foods, but you should not use it to limit yourself to 1200/day. \n\nFor reference, I'm the 'perfect' candidate to maintain on a 1200/day plan.

I did one cup of water because flax absorbs water. (You might find 3/4's is enough) and garlic powder with Italian spice blend to taste. (I've been known to sometimes throw in nutritional yeast, you do you) 1 1/2 tsp salt.\n\nPopped the crust on the stovetop (if you have a cast iron) and let it cook under so it's nice and browned on the bottom, then pop it in the oven for a bit cooked on top, or pop it in the oven, and cook both sides at once. This gives it the nice, crispy pizza taste, not floppy/soggy. Pull it back out, and top it up with whatever you want, then pop it back in until it's melted, then turn broil on for the nice browning on top! It'll be beautiful.\n\nThis actually made another little pizza as well, because the original amount for this dough was two 10 ten inch.

{"body":"I'm so down to help you meal plan! Link me to the site! I'm pretty new to /r/1200isplenty too, but I've always been conscious of my calories. I'm going into my second year of college, so I won't need the meal plan anymore, but when I was a freshman I managed to find the healthiest food in the dining halls while everyone else complained about the food being disgusting or unhealthy. It's easy if you know what to look for.\n\nFor example, at the sandwich shop, they had an option to put your sandwich in a bowl, no bread. That eliminated some calories. We have an Einstein's Bagels, where I would order from their under 400 calorie menu, which used thin wheat bagels topped with things like egg whites/asparagus/cheese or smoked salmon/capers/cream cheese. My school even had a BBQ night every Monday, where they'd serve salmon, salad, BBQ beans, garlic bread, and cookies. I just got the salmon, the salad, and sometimes one cookie because the sugar cookies were so good!!!\n\nAt the buffet, I would skip the proteins with a lot of sweet sauce or breading and just go for the plain chicken breast or fish. Other times I would go for the stir fry of meat with veggies in the Asian section. I wasn't really interested in any of the pastas, pizzas, or other high-calorie options, unless they had brown rice that day. They usually serve sides of veggies such as green beans, broccoli, or zucchini, so I would add that to my plate. The salad bar is great, too. Fruit is pretty easy to find at the dining halls.\n\nI guess one of the harder parts is that you'll often be eating at the dining halls with friends, so it's tough to resist the temptation to eat the same things they do. You have to remember that you'll feel a lot more energized if you don't eat all the crappy college food. I know this because I definitely had my slip-ups.\n\nMake sure you bring some of your favorite snacks to keep in your dorm! I liked to have greek yogurt, apple chips, freeze dried fruit, toasted edamame, raw almonds, berries, seaweed, frozen veggies, plain instant oatmeal, light microwave popcorn, and goldfish crackers (my guilty pleasure). My favorite snack will always be unbuttered air popped popcorn, but my school had a rule against appliances in the dorms. Does your dorm come with a mini fridge and microwave?

You'll be way less likely to overeat due to stress after a few days, if you're anything like me.  I can maintain 1300-1350 a day indefinitely, without rolling into stress-binge territory. so I end up losing more weight than had I tried to stick to 1200 strictly.

{"body":"You're welcome! \n\nTo answer your question, I do, but as I get closer I will lose less weight each week because the deficit will be smaller. My maintenance intake for my current weight and lack-of-activity level (170lbs) is ~1800 calories, and the maintenance for an equally sedentary 140lbs is ~1500 calories. So I've got a planned deficit of 300 daily, which is roughly a 2/3lb a week loss if you go by the 3500cal/pound rule. And I've been down about that each week over the last 2 months. As I get closer, I might drop my intake a little lower just to keep a steadier pace. I try to reevaluate my plan every 10 pounds or so, just to keep myself from plateauing for an extended period of time. I think my current plan, barring any setbacks, should have me at 140lbs in 9 months. But I know me, there will be setbacks (holidays are indulgent!), so I'm loosely aiming for a year from now.\n\nAnother thing I forgot to mention earlier, is that I really like the option to view your nutrition by weeks in MFP, I think it helps keep things in a better perspective. There's no point in beating yourself up for over-eating one day, if you ate at or under your target the rest of the week. I try to keep the weekly average at 1450/day, meaning that some days I eat 1900, other days I eat 1200, and some days it's a party and I hit 2500, but I try to keep it between 1400-1500. \n\nI'm not against having an extra beer or glass of wine or cupcake here or there, but when the treat becomes a staple, then I have a problem and I need to deal with it. Constantly treating myself is how I got to be 200+lbs, and it wasn't doing me any good. So I changed! ","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

{"body":"Fruit is healthy and good for you, but it's also nature's candy and should be eaten in moderation. The old wives tale that you should always snack on fruit, you can have as much as you want... none of it is true.\n\nStick to two pieces of fruit a day max, one if it's higher calorie like apples, bananas, mangoes, grapes, etc. And make sure you weigh them: calorie counters will place a banana at 100 and an apple at 80, but most bananas are often 120+ calories, and large apples can be even higher!\n\nFruit is also just carbs and sugar, which can make you even hungrier than you were before you ate it. Especially apples -- they're not ideal to snack on by themselves, and do better with a small amount of peanut butter, cream cheese, avocado, or some other fat or protein. It takes a lot to fill up on fruit alone, and this might be why you feel you're eating a lot of it.\n\nBut 300 calories worth of snacks isn't really a big deal. That's one banana, one clementine, and a greek yogurt. I would look into cutting your meals a little bit, or picking a snack that's lower calorie but more filling (maybe half an apple with some cottage cheese).

You'll feel like garbage, which can cause your willpower to fold and before you know it, you've eaten back your entire deficit.\n\nAt a healthy weight like you are now anyway, fast weight loss is not ideal. Just keep truckin'. If you have doubts, re-check food weights and such to make sure you're not missing something. (Oils, butter, measure those things!) Otherwise, I bet it's just water retention.

Since I'm in college it's hard to find time to cook so I eat a lot of pre-packaged and frozen sodium-filled crap :/ I haven't been trying to eat healthier really, just less. Maybe I should focus on REAL foods instead of processed stuff. My breakfasts are usually protein bars :( granted, they have 20g of protein for 200 calories but it's all fake shit. For lunch I'll usually eat a clementine, 80 cal yogurt, and a peanut butter sandwich on 45 cal bread. Dinner is usually a lean cuisine or like a frozen vegan burrito or something like that. And for a snack I LOVE CHIPS AND SALSA. Another person mentioned my weekend splurges could just be averaging out any deficit I have so that I'm only in maintenance. That could be why I'm not losing weight I guess. \n\nI have heard a lot of people say that when they start running, the weight \"just falls off\" even if they don't want it to. At first it seemed that way, but now I'm like ehhh. As far as shoes, I wear Nikes that I got like 2 years ago and they're falling apart. I've only been running since May so I'm not really sure if there is a certain type of shoe I should be wearing? Lol","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

I actually can provide some insight into the mechanism by which this happens because I study the topic at U of A (East) which is a premier school for doing research on topic derailment.\n\nThe biggest thing to understand is this: When someone brings up a topic the traditional manner of resolving the conversation naturally is to proceed to discuss the topic. Discussion of the topic takes the standard form of point and counterpoint exchange, whereby one person expresses an opinion and contributes it to the conversation and the next person then provides either a supporting or contrasting contribution to the conversation. This, under normal conditions, will proceed for a certain period of time, but under abnormal conditions could very well proceed over a period of location instead of time. - [explanation](https://books.google.com/books?id=EZbcwk6SkhcC&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)\n\nSo what is the takeaway here?\n\nThere are many ways to contemplate what may or may not be a mathematically impossibility, but what will never change is the manner in which these conundrums are ultimately resolved: through the contemplative denotation of the factors at play in the situation, and nothing more.","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

{"body":"Hey, I'm a reformed keto-er too! We're on the go a lot and with our schedule it was extremely difficult to maintain cooking 2 meals, one for me and one for the non-ketoer in my house.\n\nHonestly I had a lot of trouble hitting my macros and staying at my calorie goal on keto. I don't find that it works well for me on a low calorie diet because a lot of keto food is pretty high calorie and the volume of food I can eat is unsatisfying to me. I see people post things like \"I was starving and then I ate 4 almonds and then didn't eat until 8 pm\" but that never worked for me. I need some bulk to my meals before my brain will process that I've had enough food.\n\nI know that people claim to feel more full on keto, but I think when you are cut down to very low calories this doesn't hold up as well. I am older and I work a desk job and I'm only 5'1. My TDEE is pretty low and realistically I need to keep my calories a little under 1200 most days to lose consistently. There are a lot of people who compensate by doing IF and eating like once a day but that makes my blood sugar really weird. The 1200 is plenty keto subreddit still has a ton of meals that are like 600 or 800 calories and small and it's difficult for me to work with that.\n\nIn the end I stalled out about 25 lbs from my goal because it took about 1300-1400 calories of keto food to really feel satisfied and not hangry all the time. I could cut down to the 1000-1100 it took me to lose but after a couple weeks I always felt miserable and exhausted and food obsessed. In the end, I could never hit my goal weight on keto, which was just to get out of the overweight BMI range.\n\nI find counting calories much easier because I can eat a lot more vegetables and fruit to bulk out my diet and I think my nutrition is a lot better overall. When I switched off I no longer had a bunch of weird symptoms like hormonal acne anymore.\n\nI got way off track with my diet after I quit smoking and gained a considerable amount of weight back, so I'm just now starting over to count calories again. I may do a short stint of keto to get some water weight off quickly, but I don't really feel like it's very sustainable for me over the long term. \n\nI do think there's some good ideas in there like limiting processed foods and added sugar so that's one thing I'll end up keeping in my bag of tricks. I realized I don't like bread and most sweets as much as I thought, so that's another place that's easy to cut calories from.\n\nBut I get you on the guilt thing. It's nice and it feels freeing to be able to adjust for special occasions without feeling all weird and guilty. Like there is an old fashioned bakery here that makes amazing cakes and my family always gets one for birthdays. A slice of that cake from there is a rare and special treat and I don't like feeling like I \"ruined\" my day or I'm \"cheating\" to have that. Or like if I want to go out and have a beer or two. Or even if there is a sale on sweet potatoes and I want to throw one on the grill for dinner a couple nights that week. \n\nHonestly I think a lot of people who feel more energetic on keto are really just feeling the effects of losing a lot of weight. I have gained back basically all of the weight I lost in the last year and I feel awful lately. Like tired all the time and achy and it takes a lot more effort to do physical things. \n\nI think it works for some people, it's just not for me. So you're not alone on that.","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

{"body":"Hey guys,  this is my first post here. I had to re-upload this as the original image didn't work.\n\nI'm embarking on a mission to lead a healthier lifestyle. I just made this for my dinner post gym session and thought I'd share with you, it was so filling I couldn't finish it all! On My Fitness Pal I have calculated everything to be 482 calories. I found a similar recipe for the noodles on the MFP app a little while ago but have adapted it somewhat. These meals are vegetarian and contain Quorn chicken and Vegi deli sage and onion slices in them, if you omit those products it'd be roughly 410 cals, omit the cheese it's 370 cals for both! I'm not a veggie, I just eat little meat and veg options tend to be far lower in cals and still provide protein. Plus there's always a good deal on Quorn and veggie products on in any supermarket so it's cheaper too. I'll list the ingredients below,  but people outside of the UK may not find some of the exact products as they're from British supermarkets. \n\n\n**How to make the noodles (serves one):**\n\n1 carrot, peeled and julienned, or use a peeler to make ribbons \n\n20g Asda good and balanced peanuts\n\n8-10 sprays Fry light coconut oil\n\n1 frozen Quorn chicken fillet,  defrost in the microwave for a minute and cut into small pieces- omit to make dish vegan or use a vegan chicken. \n\n1 tbsp fresh ginger grated- use powder if need be. \n\n1 garlic clove crushed and finely chopped\n\n20ml Koko dairy free coconut derived milk. Any brand coconut milk would do though\n\n20g Asda reduced fat peanut butter\n\n1/2 tsp dried coriander leaf (cilantro) \n\n1/2 tsp chilli/cayenne powder\n\n1/2 tsp ginger powder\n\n1/2 tsp garlic salt\n\nSalt and black pepper to taste\n\n**To garnish:**\n\n1 spring onion/scallion,  chopped\n\nFresh coriander/cilantro leaves\n\nLime wedges,  for squeezing juice\n\n**To make:**\n\nSpray a frying pan with the Fry light cooking spray,  I use the coconut oil one, it's 1 calorie a spray. Set on a low heat and add the fresh ginger and garlic. Fry for a few minutes then add the carrot ribbons, Quorn chicken and peanuts. Stir regularly to avoid burning as Fry light is obviously not like using normal oil ( you could use normal oil but the calories are bumped up!). \n\nWhilst the carrots etc are cooking, in a bowl combine the peanut butter,  koko milk and all of the herbs listed after them. Once the carrots look a little browned on the edges, add the peanut sauce to the pan; it's not a lot of sauce but it will cover the noodles lightly, add more pb and milk if you want more sauce. Mix thoroughly and heat for a minute or two. Once warmed through, plate and garnish with green onions and coriander leaves. Squeeze a few wedges of lime over the top- it's delicious this way. Add salt and pepper to your liking. \n\n\n**The salad was simply the following ingredients diced and combined in a big ol' bowl:**\n\n30g little gem lettuce \n\n1 salad tomato \n\n30g cucumber \n\n10g red Bell pepper\n\n20g red onion\n\nHalf a spring onion/scallion\n\n15g Asda jalape\u00f1o stuffed green olives (any jar of olives will do, I love the spicy ones though) \n\n2 slices of Vegideli sage and onion slices. I buy these in Morrison's, there are similar products in the US, I've seen them. Any vegan/veg cold cut will be good, chicken style might be better actually. \n\n20g weight watchers grated/shredded cheese (43cals a portion or 11% fat) \n\n20g Morrison's Nu Me Caesar salad dressing- this is insanely low fat (12 cals per 20g) so I guess it doesn't taste as good as normal Caesar but I'm on a diet here! I'm not sure if you'll find something as low calorie in other countries but you can always look or use other brands sparingly.\n\nThat's it! I had mine with sugar-free lemon cordial from Tesco and a cup of raspberry white tea, in case you're wondering what I'm drinking. I hope you like these ideas and find some inspiration in them!

I\u2019m so glad I can help people out by sharing my meal preps!  I can\u2019t believe how much debate my previous post caused.  So I\u2019ll lay this out one more time, and then I\u2019m not going to respond to the comments from people who take the time to post but not to read anything beforehand!  Some people require far less calories than others, because of their petite stature and low activity levels.  Just because you require more calories, doesn\u2019t mean someone smaller, less active, and/or wanting to lose weight is starving themselves or being unhealthy because they aren\u2019t consuming a calorie count that is suitable for you and your body.  I\u2019m 5\u20191, sedentary, and wanting to lose weight \u2013 this calorie range is right for me.  Pop onto google and find a calorie calculator, and figure out what\u2019s a good range for you.  I guarantee that what is healthy for you is not healthy for me.  And what is healthy for me is not healthy for you.  I speak to my doctor about weight loss and I am exactly where I need to be calorie wise.    \n\nI prepare my meals in advance because I have chronic pain \u2013 there are days where I can barely make it off the couch or out of bed.  So if I have the steam to lay out the day and make it easy on myself later, I will.  I\u2019M NOT SUGGESTING THIS AS A MEAL PLAN FOR ANYONE, I\u2019m not saying everyone should eat this number of calories, I'm not saying this is perfect macronutrients-wise, and I'm not asking for anyone to \"fix\" my diet.  I\u2019m simply saying \u201cThis is what I happen to eat, this is how many calories there are.\u201d  I\u2019m way more than happy to answer any questions about what\u2019s pictured, but people have to do some work if they want to eat healthy.  Don\u2019t rely on my portion sizes and calorie counts \u2013 www.sparkpeople.com is an amazing resource to figure out calories and what portion sizes would be good for you and your caloric needs!  &lt;3 :)\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

{"body":"I kept track of my binges for a while to see what was triggering them, and then developed tactics for avoiding them. For me, it came down to three causes- lack of sleep, specific foods, and feeling \"denied\" when my diet was too restrictive. \n\nWhen I haven't gotten enough sleep, I do not have the facilities to make a good decision. I tend to eat whatever crap is easiest, and usually unhealthiest. I don't have the energy to cook a healthy meal, and I don't have the mental mojo to talk myself into healthier food. I get cranky and want fattening, heavy food because I'm in a bad mood. So, I make sure I get to bed earlier, and my fiance has a few things he cooks for me when I'm in a cranky-eat-all-the-things mood. \n\nCertain foods I cannot only eat a portion size. Ice cream, pretzels, and pizza at home are my biggest offenders. I do not *ever* bring those items home any longer. Instead, I'll have them when we're out, so I can order a single serving (for $$$), which severely limits my ability to become a human black hole.\n\nFinally, the restricted diet thing. If I start to feel denied, like I'm saying no all the time to delicious food, I get cranky and want to rebel. So I don't say no all the time. I work in the unhealthier foods. I'm craving Taco Bell? Okay, fine, Saturday I'll delay breakfast so that I can have a 700 calorie bomb at Taco Bell at 11 AM, then a light dinner and snack at night. I just went to four different birthday celebrations in the past two weeks. Rather than saying no to all the cake that results in a binge, I looked forward to splitting a bundlet from Nothing Bundt Cakes with my fiance. \n\nEating snack-style fruits and veggies makes me feel like I'm dieting, and that I'm being denied \"good\" foods, so instead I mix them into a meal. Mostly, I substitute an amount of carbs for extra vegetables, like lessening the noodles in Dragon Noodles and throwing in a ton of steamed broccoli. It's a mental thing with me- if I had eaten the broccoli on the side, I would feel like I was being denied the good stuff, which would lead to me consuming all the pasta instead. \n\nTLDR; Figure out what's triggering the binges and come up with specific solutions.

I topped the eggs with dried chives and seasoned to taste. 91 calories. \n\n1/2 400g tin of chopped tomatoes, any will do, Asda's finest value ones for me!  Added my own dried basil, some chilli powder and salt and pepper. Just cook 'em in a saucepan or in the mic. 41 calories. \n\n1 large flat white Mushroom (16cals!). Three sprays of Fry light butter, seasoned with salt,  pepper,  garlic powder and chilli powder. I also added one extra light laughing cow triangle at 19 cals and 20g weight watchers grated cheese at 43 cals and popped it in the oven on gas mark 9 for five minutes. \n\nThe crispbreads are Polish.

When I'm following 1200, adding cream cheese to a 300 cal bagel pushes past what I'd like to be eating for breakfast. And what's a bagel without cream cheese?? I'd much rather make own for a very reasonable 180 calories. \n\nThese loosely follow [Emeril Lagasse's recipe here](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/emeril-lagasse/homemade-bagels-recipe.html), with a few adjustments. This recipe makes 12 chubby, adorable bagels, which freeze really well and are SUPER adjustable for your needs. [Here](http://imgur.com/a/T513P) are the nutrition facts, per MFP. \n\nI used 1 1/2 cups whole wheat and 2 1/2 cups all-purpose, with another 1/2 cup all-purpose added during mixing/kneading. Whole wheat flour sucks up water a LOT more than all-purpose, so reducing the total flour amount is important so they don't end up dry. \n\nI also used brown sugar rather than white (for a slightly richer, deeper flavour). Next time, I think I'll try honey, because whole wheat/honey combo is life. \n\nDuring boiling, I added honey and baking soda to the boiling water - this supposedly gives the bagels their nice, shiny crust. I eyeballed the amounts, but I probably added about 3 tablespoons of honey and 2 tablespoons of baking soda. Since this was my first time making them, I'm not sure what kind of difference it made, but these are lovely, firm, and almost crisp outside, and soft and chewy inside. \n\nThese were boiled for 1 minute on each side and baked at 375 F for ~20 minutes and turned out perfect. \n\nI left 6 plain and made a parmesan/parsely/garlic/onion topping for the other 6.

Sautee till soft, add the tomato paste, chicken, olives, the lemon (if using a fresh lemon, add the zest ONLY and add the juice at the end), and stock. \n\n3- Cover and let simmer for 20 minutes. \n\n4- Meanwhile prepare the couscous (I use the package instructions, I prepared 80 grams of dry medium-grain couscous per serving + 5 grams butter per serving + a generous pinch of salt).

Today for a lunch I had zucchini noodles with jarred pasta sauce all cooked in the microwave, a soft boiled egg from the kettle, an orange, and a romaine heart with Bolthouse Caesar dressing. I like to keep a log of goat cheese in the fridge, too. It's usually ~70 calories an ounce, which when you measure it is a large chunk of goat cheese. I put it on pretty much anything if I'm feeling like I want some cheese. \n\nAlso, there's a silicon microwave rice cooker product on Amazon that can be used to cook many items in the microwave, like quinoa or any other grains. I also really like the Kirkland 5.5 cup bags of microwave popcorn- they come out to about ~200 calories a bag and are a great snack for when you need a study snack. \n\nFor breakfast, I really like the quick steel cut oats that can be cooked in a microwave and I usually put some cashews and maple syrup or stir a little bit of Nutella and some fresh fruit. I also like yogurt, avocado toast on low calorie bread, sometimes throw a soft boiled egg on it, sometimes just have a hard boiled egg and no avocado toast. \n\nI try to avoid eating too much from my meal plan.

I tend to avoid healthy foods like nuts and avocado which are high in fat, but I generally find that fruit is a really good option for me. For example this afternoon I had two satsumas (25cal each) and an apple (60ish calories) to fill the gap, which is around 100 cals for three pieces of fruit.

For instance, I jazz up some steamed veggies (done in microwave) and undercook the veggies by a min or so, dump out the water at the bottom, dice up the laughing cow wedge (this part is crucial - more surface area for meltage) and stir it in then nuke for another minute or so. Stir, and it's done.\n\nEdit to add: I much prefer this with the other wedge flavors (all of which are 35cal/ea) as opposed to the traditional favorite of this sub, which is the low fat swiss.

It is generally suggested that men eat at least 1500 calories per day, but another metric is losing no more than 1% of your body weight per week. Along with nutrition, this will guard against losing muscle mass.               \n\nIf you ate an average of 1500 per day, you would lose ~1.2lbs per week, which is right around where you'd want to be (3500 calories = 1lb of fat).               \n\nIf you want to do the 5:2 diet, I would suggest 2 days at 600 calories and 5 days at 1800 calories.","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

{"body":"The 'brand' of rice and beans really doesn't matter. Buy in bulk, buy them dry, and whatever package is cheapest per lb. Most beans and rice varieties should be under $1/lb (US). \n\nTo choose variety, base it on what you plan on making out of it. Typically, long grain rice will be cheapest and versatile.\n\nIn college, I would cook up a huge pot of a bean dish on Sunday and mostly eat that all week. Beans take time to soak and cook, but once their in the pot, take minimal fussing. You can get some variety out of your dishes with different seasoning and flavor profiles. Always cook your beans in broth/stock and/or with vegetables like onions, garlic, carrots, celery, peppers. Invest in some herbs and spices (you can usually get them cheap at local mexican/ethnic shops in the US).\n\nAs for online, If you are financially strained, I would bite the bullet and get to a grocery store once a month. You can buy a lot at once (onions, carrots tend to keep for a while at least. If you have a freezer, your veggie options are more open). Dry beans and rice will keep indefinitely. Canned veggies too.\n\nSome of my go -to bean dishes you can google recipes for:\nHam and beans (needs a ham bone)\nall bean chili (I add meat individually to each serving)\ndirty rice/red beans and rice (beans and hamburger meat)\njambalaya \n\n\nSpices/herbs that may be helpful:\n\npaprika/red pepper\n\ngarlic powder/onion powder\n\noregeno, bay leaves, basil, thyme, rosemary\n\ncumin, turmeric, curry powders, chili powders\n\nAlso: Does your university offer a pantry service? Are there local pantries available? You can get boxes of free food. Being a student does not disqualify you for things like that. \n\n\nAlso, chicken thighs/quarters are usually less than a $1/lb (skin on, bone in). A good 'splurge' to get some protein on a budget. Just season them, pop them in the oven for like, 30-40 minutes. No need to de-bone or cut off fat. ~250 cal for a thigh.\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

Finally decided to try them out over the weekend and I\u2019m kicking myself for waiting this long! There is *no* zucchini flavor, they have the same stretchy-resilient quality of pasta, and they\u2019re a breeze to prepare. This lo mein was unreal. Went way beyond my expectations and totally satisfied any salty, savory, junk food cravings I had. This one is going into my weekly rotation for sure!\n\n\nI used a Paderno spiralizer on the smallest setting, salted the zucchini for 30 minutes, rinsed and wrung it bone-dry. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 4 oz. chicken breast, flattened and cut into strips (110 calories)\n\n* 1 medium spiralized zucchini (31 calories)\n\n* 1/4 cup white onion, sliced lengthwise (15 calories)\n\n* 1 clove garlic, minced (4 calories)\n\n* 1 tsp. olive oil (36 calories)\n\n\n*Marinade*\n\n* 1.5 tbsp low sodium soy sauce (22 calories)\n\n* 2 tbsp. rice wine vinegar (0 calories)\n\n* 1.5 tsp sweetener (I used Swerve, 0 calories)\n\n*Sauce*\n\n* 1/2 tbsp low sodium soy sauce (8 calories)\n\n* 1/2 tsp sweetener (Swerve again, 0 calories)\n\n* 3 tbsp water\n\n* 1/2 tsp cornstarch (5 calories)\n\n* 2 tsp rice wine vinegar (0 calories)\n\n* 1 tsp oyster sauce (8 calories)\n\n* 1/2 tsp fish sauce (1 calorie)\n\n* 1/2 tsp sesame oil (20 calories)\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\n**Directions** \n\nCombine ingredients for the marinade in small, non-reactive bowl and add chicken. Cover and refrigerate for 30 min-1 hr. Add olive oil to non-stick pan and cook chicken over medium-high heat - this shouldn\u2019t take more than 2 or 3 minutes. Remove from pan and lower to medium heat. Add onion and cook until softened and translucent, then add garlic and stir until fragrant.\n\nAdd chicken and spiralized zucchini to the pan. Pour in the sauce and toss continuously for 2-3 minutes until the sauce has slightly thickened and zucchini is cooked. Remove and enjoy!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**270 calories**\n\n* 31 g protein\n\n* 19 g carbohydrates (16 g net)\n\n* 3 g fiber\n\n* 8 g sugar\n\n* 8 g fat","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

{"body":"Sub cauliflower for so many things. I live in Prague and it's super cheap. Riced (food processor or grated by hand), mashed, roasted, pur\u00e9ed. I make riced ahead of time and freeze it so I don't resort to real rice on busy nights. I like to makes mashed potatoes using half cauliflower or parsnips. Serve with roasted meat of choice &amp; steam veggies.  \n \nI personally love salads. Add poached shredded chicken, tuna, crumbly cheese, etc. for protein and use lemon and herbs instead of dressing. \n \nPur\u00e9ed soups in general are super cheap and filling and use minimal ingredients. Roast Squash, broccoli, cabbage, peas, cauliflower, carrots, etc. then saut\u00e9 onions/garlic/herbs/broth. Mix it all together with a stick blender and voila! Serve with whole wheat toast and it's still a low cal meal. Always make extra and freeze it in single portion bags for nights you don't feel like cooking. \n \n I always keep veggie stock powder from Alnatura to flavor everything without adding many calories. Alnatura also makes these awesome veggie dips with sunflower seed base that's great with cucumbers for snack.  I also use nutritional yeast as a topping instead of cheese and as a general flavor enhancer.  Use oat cream for cooking instead of cream. Sub mushrooms for meat. I'm not vegan but sometimes stuff geard toward that diet has less calories. Use the cheap recipe sites, just try to sub the most caloric thing in the recipe to something else. \n \nFor breakfast, OATS! You can't get much cheaper with such a nutrition bang. I usually do overnight oats with half chia seeds and vanilla extract.  I buy chia in bulk. I top it with and fresh seasonal fruit and use just a bit of maple syrup or date syrup. If you like savory, buckwheat or kasha is only about 150cal per cup.

Slower than I did before, but consistent.\n\nYou seem like you're really good with your exercise, and your eating habits, you just need more! It'll keep you from bingeing on stuff that'll make you feel like crap too.\n\nSomething else to think about is using like Nutritional yeast and things like that, that you can mix into foods to make sure you're hitting everything along the way. \n\nI think all your intentions are good, it's really scary when you've been fat sometimes because there's carrying around the fear of going back to that, but your mindset is different. You are different then you were, and obviously *really* in control of your food habits. Don't be scared to let loose. One thing I learned in this sub for sure. Even if you don't do 1,200 (and you shouldn't!), you should still browse around. You can learn a lot about meal prep. R/fitness will help you get to where you want to be. They are nice and great over there.\n\nWeigh yourself every 10-12 days in the mornings so you can see how you progress if you want. Honestly, if you wanna be *really thin* you'll have to sacrifice muscle, and I don't think you want to do that! At this point, I'd have to say if you keep doing what you're doing, and start eating more, you should definitely gain weight *in muscle*. I'm hoping to get some myself soon, so hopefully by then you can give ME advice!\n\nMental health is just as important as physical, don't ignore it.

{"body":"Binge is hard to stop if you're making yourself feel horrible about it. It turns into an obsessive-compulsive thing. At first you're really, really restricting yourself, and then you're totally letting go. And then you feel horrible, and then you restrict yourself again, and then again you let go. It turns into a vicious cycle.\n\nFirstly: Eating well is a habit you need to develop. You can't be perfect, expecting perfection from yourself is not fair to you and will only feed the vicious cycle. Think of it like learning to play tennis, or an instrument. You just can't perfect it from day one.\n\nWhat everybody told me was to be consistent in logging your food, whatever you eat, however you eat. It works in the long run. Don't ever stop.\n\nWhen I started my war against binging what I did was 1- portion control. If 2 slices of cake is your normal, you know how your stomach feels afterwards. Next time eat only 1 slice and then tell yourself, out loud: I've eaten a slice and it tastes amazing, and it's enough. (I'm a big fan of saying everything out loud - hearing things from your own voice makes all the difference).\n\n2- Whenever you feel like you want to eat, think about how your stomach feels. If it's full, tell yourself, I'm going to eat the hell out of that slice once I'm hungrier. If you're hungry, say: I'm hungry and it's totally okay for me to feed myself. I don't have to feel bad for this.\n\n3- Binge on stuff that's harder to eat. Like hazelnuts with their shells still on. The longer it takes to eat, the fuller you'll feel while eating.\n\nYou actually can fit every food in 1200 calories, what you cannot fit is the amount. All food are good.

There is a major discrepancy among the average person. \n\nMy alma mater did a study in the 50s on starvation (one of the most important studies in the history of Nutrition, because they conducted it prior to modern regulations being in place) and they restricted people to 1,800 calories a day, and most were unrecognizable in a matter of months, no sex drive, depression, psychosis etc... that was among the small % that even lasted that long.\n\nBasically I was just trying to ask y'all what is different about this place, hoping to read about how people here know they have low metabolic rates due to known conditions. Hoping to see that many of you have already seen dietitians and they supported the **extreme** calorie restriction being pushed here. I was hoping to read about how y'all are responsible and recommend people get their BMR checked before doing something dangerous like committing to 1,200 calories a day. No such discussion was found. TBH it looks more like a place for pretentious people to meet and pretend like they eat 1,200 calories a day...\n\nWould've been nice to actually have a discussion, I bet there are quite a few people (among that 0.01% of the population) here who use this resource to actually get an average nearing 1,200 calories per day which is actually consistent with their metabolic needs. Would've been interesting to talk to these people.

I have some left in my fridge and sometimes if I'm hungry and not in the cooking, I'll reach for a bottle instead of fast food. \n\nIf you want more info on soylent, go to /r/soylent.

I am off training for a full marathon next year (Needed new shoes, please tell me what you wear, I'm sick, I need help)\n\nHonestly, I'm stumped as to why you aren't losing weight. It hasn't left my mind since I read this post (Hello, fellow runner best buddy) I actually cut out carbs decently and focused more on high proteins because that gave me no bloat, and best results. The weight started falling off. I wanted to central around what made me feel best when I was running. I always felt \"too full\" on carbs (breads, pizzas, that kinda stuff) and cut my cheese down significantly because I was eating way too much. I also don't do a lot of fried food unless I really want it. I learned a lot of \"cuts\" so I could eat more..One cup of egg whites, half a cup of chopped green peppers, two slices of diced tomatos, some nutrional yeast, half cup of cottage cheese..240 calorie breakfast, and an absolutely full bowl. I toss in a bottle of G2 50 calorie. Add avocado! It gave me really good results to start up, and it was really good for my running. I always feel clean. Stuff like that adds up. Could you be over doing carbs? Or having sneaky dense foods?\n\nCould you be gaining muscle? I noticed I started gaining muscle, in my legs especially. \n\n\nMy tag line is nutritional yeast, I use that a lot now. You might wanna try it. You can mix it in eggs, cakes, cookies, breads, I mix it in the protein recipe I posted last night. It pacts an extra punch for me. \n\nI wrap chicken in bacon and stuff it with tomato and chopped feta and spinach when I feel hungry for something \"more\" and cut the breast in half, it's filling.

I read all kinds of recipes online with tons of steps and ingredients and was put off, but I went simple and am glad I did! \n\nBasically:\n\n- 1 head of cauliflower\n\n- 2 eggs (not sure if 1 would work. I used 2 to be safe to keep from crumbling)\n\n- spices of choice (garlic, oregano, etc)\n\n- sauce of choice (I made tomato sauce)\n\n- toppings of choice\n\n\nPreheat the oven to 400\u00b0F.\n\nMake \"cauliflower rice\" in a food processor as you want small, almost grain-like pieces. Place in a bowl with a bit of water and microwave for about 5 minutes. \n\nTake out and drain as much of the water out as possible. I chose to spread it as a thin layer on a table to steam it out some, but I think this can be omitted. I then wrapped it all in a cheesecloth and squeezed the ever-loving life outta that thing. It's amazing how much \"juice\" is in one cauliflower. Good for soups.\n\nThen beat in your eggs and spices. Grease a baking sheet and spread the cauliflower into desired pizza crust shape. The mixture will be sort of wet, not like pizza dough. A little more like cookie dough. I made mine pretty thin, maybe 0.5\" thick. Seemed just right.\n\nBake for about 40 minutes. I opted to take mine out a bit early as it got very brown. Then remove and let cool for a few minutes on a cooling rack to prevent sogginess before spreading your sauce. I blended together fresh tomatoes and basil for my sauce (though it was too watery... definitely want a chunkier sauce to prevent the cauliflower from soaking it all up, giving a soggy crust). Then top with cheese, your desired toppings, etc.\n\nBake again, not for long. Maybe 5-10 minutes when cheese gets melty. Take out, place on cooling rack, cut and enjoy!

{"body":"I pretty much eat exactly what I ate before 1200, just half the portion and adding about 1/2 - 1 lb of zucchini (or other veggie) to it. I eat zucchini/squash 80% of the time. For reference, I usually eat a ~100 cal breakfast, ~300 cal lunch, ~100 cal snack, ~700 cal dinner. I have to go to bed full, so I just eat an obscene amount of veggies with my dinner, depending on how caloric the main course is.\n\nA lot of people don't like squashes because of the texture. This can be fixed a bit by allowing the squash to dry on paper towels for a short while before cooking. You'll always want to cook it with a high heat method (your George foreman should work), maybe with just a bit of oil or butter. Season it heavily.  Cutting it into thicker spears works well for me. \n\nAlso, when I make dishes that would heavily feature a meat (such as a curry), I cut the meat portion in half and replace it with squash or eggplant. \n\nI try to replace carbs (rice, bread, potatoes) with veggies.\nIf I make fried rice, I will replace half of the rice or more with shredded cauliflower. Cauliflower also makes tasty mash with butter and milk added. Spinach/lettuce instead of a bun. \n\nFrozen veggies are great too. Get the steam-in-bag kind (usually available in generic brand too for ~1-2$) and pop it in and eat the whole thing for ~100 calories.","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

{"body":"Yes! Belgian here who divides her time between the Netherlands and Belgium! Lately I have been OBSESSED with the vietnamese pho \"instant noodles\" from the AH. 275 calories and soooo filling, plus 18 grams of protein. Their little kip-ketjap noodle salad is great too; add a pile of spinach for extra volume. It's a bit expensive though.\n\nThe Optimel fat-free \"drinkyoghurts\" are great as well, really low in calories and they come in lots of yummy flavours. You can also get Fage 0% greek yoghurt in the AH, which has great macros. \n\nFurthermore, all of AH's sliced bread is about 80 calories a slice. Not amazing, I know, but they're pretty big slices. This isn't 45-kcal-a-slice-land. I wish there were lowcal tortillas as well, but they seem impossible to find here. \n\nAH's tzatziki is also worth mentioning, especially as a dip for cucumber and carrot sticks. There are two different ones though so make sure you get the right one, just check the calorie counts on the little containers. You should be able to find it near all the olives and hummus and things.\n\nI'm racking my brain trying to think of more stuff but I can't come up with much right now.

Then I just make another note with a shopping list generated from whatever recipes I choose.\n\nFor example: this week I decided to make the \"Disney\" version of ratatouille. I knew that would make 4 servings. So I planned to have it for Monday Dinner, Tuesday lunch, Wednesday dinner, and Friday lunch. If you have a second recipe, it's easy to fill in the remaining gaps around that, or come up with other options if you have fewer servings. \n\nI also always have some standby meal options in my head that I use over and over if I don't feel like trying something new. But I follow the same pattern: make enough for dinner one night and another lunch, either the next day or later in the week. These usually contain frozen components so I can always have them onhand. For example: I always have some frozen dumplings and frozen turkey burgers in the freezer. So then, I just need to pick a veggie side and I'm done.\n\nSince I don't get sick of food super quickly, it works out for me to just alternate dinners and lunches this way.\n\nI also pretty much eat the same three breakfasts (hard boiled eggs + fruit; green smoothie; or overnight oats), so I just decide ahead of time which I'm gonna eat each day, add that to my Weekly Meals note and whatever I need to my shopping note.\n\nI also don't snack between meals really (so I can have bigger meals overall), so that also cuts down on my mental planning energy needed. But if I do, I usually just get a couple different types of fruit to eat throughout the week.\n\nOh and because I'm super OCD, I add everything into MyFitnessPal for the whole week ahead of time so I know where I stand calorically each day, and if I need to tweak anything.\n\nIt's tricky at first, but once you develop a system, it's really satisfying!

I try to find something else to do in this case - go for a walk, put on music and do stuff around the house, read a book, garden, talk it out with a friend, etc. \n\n- 3) Thoughtless eating while watching tv - I try to a) limit how much time I watch tv, b) find things to do with my hands (no, not like that...I meant curl a kettlebell or play videogames on the tube instead), c) buy snacks I can mindlessly munch on with minimal guilt, like fresh vegetables, air popped popcorn, etc. \n\nOther tips: I tend to let myself have little portions of less-than-nutritious things or try to make them healthier. Like I'll get a small pizza and have a small slice or two, plus extra veggies, over the course of a few days. I'll buy a fancy dark chocolate bar and have a few squares.

{"body":"Good morning! \n\nWell I weighed myself today and lost 8lbs since Saturday last (I know I know some is water weight) so I decided to have poachies for breakfast today. \n\n\nThis meal was 285 calories according to MFP. It consists of:\n\n\n2 large eggs at 80 cals each. \n\n1 whole tomato, diced. 16 cals\n\n2 Kingsmill crumpet thins. Aka pikelets. These are a pretty British thing to eat to be honest. They're like slim crumpets. This brand is 54 cals per thin. They are CHUFFING delicious. \n\nYou could use small eggs to knock those calories off but I only have large. I boiled water and white vinegar in a pan, gave it a swirl, cracked an egg into a glass then poured the egg into the centre of the spinning water. I cook my poached eggs for about 3-4 minutes for a really runny egg. Don't set the water too high,  you don't wanna boil your eggs now! Gently simmer them instead. Once to your liking pop them on some kitchen roll to drain then season. I like chives, paprika,  black pepper and salt on mine. \n\nI seasoned the tomatoes the same way as my eggs and had my trusty friend Maggi hot on hand to add taste to my dry pikelets. I'm drinking ristretto coffee at 2cals and minty tea. \n\n[These are the specific pikelets I eat](http://d2td6mzj4f4e1e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2015/07/Crumpet-Thins.jpg). They are perfect for a light breakfast if you love a good crumpet. British redditors, give them a try! \n\nFor our foreign counterparts wondering what the balls I'm on about,  [this page](http://www.villagebakery.co.uk/blog/bakery-blog/pikelet-vs-crumpet-whats-the-difference/) explains what crumpets and pikelets are. They're really popular in the UK as an alternative to toast for breakfast. I have 100% seen crumpets being sold in Santander Monica, Cali last year when I was on holiday, in a novelty British shop next to some British 'pub'. So if you can find them, try them! :) \n\nEnjoy!

{"body":"Oh man, did I use to worship at the low-carb alter so hard, and you're right, it is good at dropping weight quick. The problem is anything that makes you lose weight faster than is healthy is that it's not sustainable. I used to adhere to the South Beach Diet like it was my religion when I was younger, and honestly, I think it really messed with my relationship to food and my body image. Issues I'm still dealing with today tbh.\n\nAs others have pointed out, weight loss is entirely CICO. So what I do now is stick with 1200 calories/day as best I can, and I try to stick to healthier carbs. \n\nFor example, beans or lentils are great for you nutritionally, but they're pretty carb heavy. You couldn't really eat them if you were keto, but I eat them often now. \n\nAnother example, if I want a bit of bread, I have some bread. I just make sure it's whole grain with no added sugar. Something like Ezekiel bread. Full disclosure though I can never turn down a good sourdough!!\n\nAnyway, I think you can definitely incorporate aspects of keto into your life. For me particularly, it's keeping an eye on added sugar and staying away from refined carbs in favor of whole grains. But girl, if I want pasta, I'm having some of my whole wheat pasta. I just make sure it's balanced out with lots of protein and veggies...and is within my 1200 cals of course :)","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

Variety is nice, but not entirely necessary to the process of getting your calories under control.\n\nCollege can be a very difficult  time to eat healthy. Just remember that you can do it if you put forth the effort.  Also, take advantage of your university's health facilities.

{"body":"Hi! Starting can be a little bit of a challenge, especially if you go from eating 4,000cal a day to 1200. So it is important to identify sources where you can get the most 'bang for your buck', so to speak. Fruit and vegetables will be your friend, because they will allow you to consume more for less calories. \n\nTo give you an example of a meal I just did today: \n\nBreakfast: Gala medium apple, black plum, 100g red grapes, 100g green grapes, banana, yellow nectarine, gummy vitamins - 432 calories.\n\nSo I was able to eat a ton of fresh fruit for breakfast and stay around 450 or less calories. You can substitute any of those fruit pieces with hard boiled eggs or 80 calorie greek yogurts for more protein! Really satisfying meals.\n\nNow here is another choice breakfast food in comparison:\n\nBreakfast: Sausage biscuit from McDonald's - 430 calories. \n\nSo you see where this is going. To give you an example for lunch:\n\nGood Lunch: 1.5 cups chunky African Peanut Stew (BudgetBytes) with a cup of fresh broccli and a cup of baby carrots - 300 calories.\n\nMaybe not-so-good lunch: McDonald's cheeseburger- 660 calories. \n\nSo the key is to prep a lot of fruits and vegetables into your meal. You can use the microwave and the rice cooker to make a lot of veggie and rice dishes. Frozen bags of veggies are pretty cheap and the more veggies you add the more 'volume' you get. Also make sure to include some protein sources (spinach, nuts, eggs, yogurt) to help keep you satisfied for longer! Finally, make sure you drink lots of water. Sometimes we confuse hunger for water pangs, so if you drink at least 80oz a day you should be clear from that. \n\nHope this helps! :)\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

{"body":"I've been eating this for a while now and figured I would share it. I've always tried to like the whole 2 ingredient pancake thing but it just reminded me that I wasn't eating real pancakes and it seemed so tiny because pancakes are supposed to be big and *FLUFFY*.\n\nAnyways, I decided one day I would just make it all together because I didn't have the patience to sit there and wait for the little pancakes and deal with the stress of them touching and forming a big ole' blob ~~first world problems~~\n\nSo, my banana egg scramble was born. It feels like way more food because it *is* a scramble whereas the two ingredient pancakes seem so little because I'm comparing it to actual pancakes. Man, the mental tricks you can play on yourself. I'm also pretty sure I didn't invent this but figured I would share a go-to breakfast of mine. \n\nI usually make this with just two eggs, mashed banana and always add a ton of cinnamon since I'm a cinnamon fiend and vanilla extract if I have on hand. This comes out to about 286 calories and upwards of 14-15 g of protein. Obviously it depends on the size of your banana and eggs. \n\nToday I decided to add one egg white to bump the protein a bit and played around w some toppings which left it at 380 calories and 20g of protein.I turned it into more of a crepe today. It's also delicious with some warm apple sauce or warm berries mmmmm. It's delicious and fairly low cal all on its own though. I promise it doesn't taste too egg-y.The mashed banana adds perfect sweetness and you can drizzle w a bit of honey. It's delicious. \n\n\nI love it because it's grain free and satisfies my love of warm and carb-y breakfasts. So it's a great replacement for porridge or toast even when I'm aiming for lower carb, too. My body just needs warmth plus sweetness in the morning no matter the season. \n\n\nAnyways, hope this inspires you to try out something new! Do you have any similar recipes? \n\nEdit: just realized I included a screenshot that had the total of 500 something calories but that's just because I already had something input for lunch later.

You might be tracking your listed intake with perfect accuracy, but being given bad data from further up the line.

Chop a garlic tooth or two. Throw them in a pan with olive oil for a couple of minutes on medium. Add some sliced mushrooms, then stir a bit. For the tomatoes, I use Campari, about 4 or 5 of 'em. Chop 'em up. When the mushrooms have been in for about a minute, add the chopped tomatoes to the pan. Put the top on and let the thing boil a bit. Add salt and pepper and any other seasoning (a pinch of chicken or beef broth powder is really nice). Now, if you're patient you can let this reduce a bit on medium or low heat until it's less liquidy.

{"body":"I didn't think I was telling you what to do, and your tiny snark was nothing.\n\nI just turned 50 years old.\n\nI picked and ate my first mushrooms when I was 17 years old.  \n\nI've eaten a few hundred different species of mushrooms, I've cultivated about 15 species, and I harvest wild mushrooms for a living.\n\nI give unsolicited advice impulsively because my whole life as a mushroom person has been a matter of educating others.\n\nAs a mushroom purveyor, public safety is a huge issue.  Chefs want to do what they want, and science says \"raw mushrooms are indigestible and cause many people tremendous upset,\" so I have to find a balance.  I said as much before.\n\nI don't let people tell me what to do either, and that extends to shitty fake journalistic sensationalism.  I rely as much as possible on science.  So when I post google search links, that's so whoever cares to pursue the info can look for themselves and choose sources they find to be reputable.  \n\nI wasn't telling you what to do.\n\nI was sharing information from my area of expertise with reddit and this subreddit in particular.\n\nIf eating mushrooms has a calorie-negative effect, then what is this sub about?  How does that effect your 1200 calories?  That's the only reason I responded.  But once I'd responded, the information on Agaritines was going to be included because of who I am.\n\nI was as neutral as possible.  Plenty of people are shooting up right now and having unprotected sex with prostitutes and jumping off of buildings.  No sane person seeks to stop daredevils and fools from destroying themselves.  That's pretty preposterous.  Smoke.  Do what you like.  I'm not a moralizer.  I'm just sharing information.\n\nThe whole meal could be criticized, yes.  You're right.  Everyone has an agenda, everyone has an opinion, and everyone wants to command others.  Diet, nutrition, and food are huge issues in our daily lives.  Indulging yourself in the face of tons of conflicting information only seems natural.  You deserve it, right?  I smoked for about 25 years.  I still feel like I deserve one every once in a while, as a reward for quitting.\n\nMy point is just this:  a mushroom expert states facts about mushrooms - you have a choice to pursue information or go on in ignorance.  Your choice.  Information is neutral.  Science is neutral.  That chitin is indigestible is indisputable.  That Agaritine and hydrazines are dangerous and deadly compounds is unequivocal.  Hydrazines kill people every year from mycophagy.\n\nInnocent store bought mushrooms are not healthy.  Period.\n\nBut Fungi is a *Kingdom*.  Mushrooms are legion.  Candy caps, chanterelles, boletes, oysters, chicken-of-the-woods, milk caps... these are all amazing and delicious mushrooms.  Compared to Agaricus mushrooms, most other wild edible mushrooms are amazing.  Flavor is subjective, though.  White button mushrooms are only prominent due to cultural and historical circumstance, and are destined to fade.\n\nI know, plenty of healthy people succumb to cancer.  Cancer rates are increasing.  We are being exposed to more and more carcinogens via the air and water and basic food staples.  In the end, there are so many causative factors that it's easy to throw up your hands and indulge.  As a mycologist I can't do that.  I have a personal obligation to mitigate the dangers of mushrooms and to reduce harm in my culture.  \n\nNevertheless, I eat mushrooms with gusto.  \n\nIf a tomato expert came into your thread and dropped some bomb about the toxicity of tomatoes, we'd all be incredulous, because they're freaking tomatoes.  We've studied the shit out of tomatoes and there is no science suggesting that large-scale consumption of tomatoes is causing cancer.  But mushrooms live in a mythological middle space, so I am a myth-buster by nature.  Touching mushrooms is fine.  Most mushrooms are not deadly.  Mushrooms respond slowly to rain, and rarely do any species \"pop up\" overnight.  Etc. etc.  No fairies, no lightning spawn.  Science is clearing up mushroom mythology rapidly but our culture still views them all as poisonous.\n\nSo I'm working within a context where the love of my life is already maligned left and right by laypeople.  For me to discourage anyone from engaging with mushrooms would be silly and counter-productive, since it is how I make my living.\n\nI'm just some guy on the internet.  The research papers found in the links I've posted are science.  I wouldn't listen to me at all, but I'd have a look at research papers if someone posted links for me.\n\nSorry to waste your time.\n\nCheers to you and keep sharing, and keep doing what you do.\n\nSorry if my comment was condescending or trite - I was only trying to be helpful, honestly.\n\nCheers!\n\n(also /r/mycology)","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

There's many things in my life that I have tend to procrastinate or have shitty willpower with but knowing that I can at least have what feels like full control over my health and weight and that's something that always keeps me in check.\n\nI guess a few ways to keep myself disciplined especially when eating out with friends or at a dinner party, I tend to section off the amount (either mentally or physically) that I'm going to eat and then take my dish to the sink or put it aside and focus on talking with my friends. Also, even though I know it annoys the shit out of everyone around me I try to quickly count up calories before ordering food and no one knows that I'm doing that they just think I'm super picky and choosy but who cares, I gotta see when I'm getting myself into. \n\nFor breakfast I like to mix it up on rotation with things that are super quick \n\n1. banana egg pancakes that are literally just banana and eggs and I like to add a lil cinnamon and a lil honey \n\n2. light style whole wheat bread toasted with honey and banana \n3. classic multi-grain cheerios with banana slices and skim milk (wow I just realized that I eat a lot of banana lol..) \n4. recently been super into oatmeal! probably one of the most unsexy foods but I get the packets from target that're 120 calories a pack and super fast to make and I like to throw in some cinnamon, granola, fruit like blueberries or you already know, banana \n5. Bagel Thins with whipped Philadelphia cream cheese come out to &lt;200cal! \n\nWith snacks I always get a few staples like carrot sticks with hummus, SmartFood Popcorn, but I mostly enjoy fruits where I find its oddly more satisfying to take the extra min to cut them up especially with peaches and apples and Korean pears \n\nFor lunch and dinner, nothing special at all haha. Mainly salads, low-calorie tortillas, been trying to experiment with different low-cal salad dressings and I've found that hummus has been nice.

There are a lot of things in your post that send of warning signals in my brain and your fear of food just seems incredibly unhealthy. \n\nMFP's exercise tracker is not too accurate, you can't get an accurate gauge of how many calories you burned without a heart rate monitor. \n\nYou should absolutely eat more when lifting, use the advanced calculator on the side to figure out how much.\n\nI wouldn't track calories burned from working out personally, it puts you in the mindset of eating back those calories. use the advanced calculator to figure out how much that is. \n\nGo to /r/fitness to figure out macros/nutrients\n\nIf you're consistently binging on 1200, then 1200 is not for you. Most people should not be eating at 1200.

Are you still trying to lose weight?  Your BMI is in a normal range. Technically yes, you can eat whatever you want as long as you're within your calorie limit (whatever limit is best for you, cause it's deff not 1200).

{"body":"I always crave sugar, fat, and salt, so the first week of me eating healthier was definitely tough.  But it does get easier!  I've found that when you make healthy choices when you're really hungry, your brain starts to associate being hungry with craving healthy foods, so you start to actually *want* to eat the things that you once had to force yourself to eat more of.  I also HATED drinking water and only got water through coffee and tea, and now I drink 2-3 liters per day.  I add lemon to every glass of water I drink, or else there's no way I could drink as much!  Lemon just gives it enough flavor/zing to allow me to drink it consistently, and it doesn't have that gross artificial taste that a lot of those flavor drops have.  It also has helped me SO much to plan out my meals, so I can see where I can swap out or lower calories per meal, to leave room for more snacks.  I would try to plan out your meals and make lower calorie choices so you have more room for snacking throughout the day. Then portion out snacks in little baggies and bring multiple snacks to work (it's good to have a variety...it feels less like a diet if you have different options!), so you can eat a little of whatever, whenever you get hungry.  It'll keep you satisfied between meals and you can't binge because you've already planned to allow for whatever you pack for yourself.

One filet of about 120 grams is only about 110 cals. Half a red bell pepper (rode paprika) is like 15 cals. Add herbs and spices to taste ofcourse. I also add a bit if chili sauce for taste (get it from AH), it doesnt have that many cals either (at least a lot less then mayonaise). in total (accounting for oil or butter used for baking the fish and potatoes) you come to about 500 cals for a cheap, healthy, and filling meal!\n\nAnother meal I really like: Rice, chicken, broccoli, and white beans in tomato sauce. I throw the broccoli in with the rice, then bake the chicken and add the white beans in tomato sauce when the chicken is as good as done. throw it all together for a great meal. Not THAT low on cals but if you keep the portions fairly small it can be a really filling low cal meal.\n\nOther food options: Magere kwark (Aldi has some tasty variants, strawberry, peach, vanilla, 50-58 cals per 100 grams).\n\nThe prepackaged meal salads from AH are really tasty in my opinion and range from 450 to 750 cals depending which one you pick. A bit expensive though so get them when they're on sale. Aldi has them too for \u20ac2,80 or something but not as much choice as AH.\n\nThat's all I can come up with atm, hope it gave you some ideas\n\nEdit: Oh another thing I do, I get magere kwark (500gr.) from aldi or AH for 75 cents or something, and add a low calorie sirup like slimpie (AH) for taste.

When I tried doing 1200 calories five or so years ago, it was a nightmare because I'd been eating 1600-1800 and didn't prepare/buy/grow the type of food I mostly eat now. I gave up fast. I spent two years getting my eating in line, slowly bringing down my calorie count and increasing fresh foods in my diet.

{"body":"Eek. I got a bit carried away and wrote out exactly how I prepared them. Sorry for the novel! When I first started out baking I liked as much detail as possible... So I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any questions!!  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Dough:**  \n2 cups warm water   \n1.5 packets Fleischmann\u2019s active dry yeast (instant rise will also work!) \n3 tablespoons brown sugar  \n1 \u00bd cups whole wheat flour  \n2 \u00bd cups unbleached all-purpose flour, plus \u00bd cup (bleached will work fine here)  \n2 teaspoons salt   \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Boiling water:**  \n2-3 tablespoons honey  \n1-2 tablespoons baking soda   \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Baking sheet prep:**  \n1-2 second spray of regular cooking spray   \n2 tablespoons yellow cornmeal  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMix together the water, yeast, and brown sugar. The water should be slightly warm, but not hot (too hot and the yeast may die). Stir until sugar dissolved, then let sit undisturbed 5-10 minutes until a foam has developed. It\u2019ll look something like [this]( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jdxCetLmGQg/VPC1eup5e1I/AAAAAAAAQtQ/NtLPeubVLcU/s1600/Proofing%2BYeast.jpg).   \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n  \nAdd the whole wheat flour and all but \u00bd cup of the all-purpose. Stir with a wooden spoon until a stiff dough forms. I didn\u2019t manage to stir in all the flour at this point, but it\u2019ll incorporate once you start kneading it. Turn your dough out onto a lightly floured surface. [Knead it]( https://youtu.be/ySOj0fFWo1U)! As you work the dough, it\u2019ll get a bit stickier. You can add the \u00bd cup of all-purpose once you reach that point. Knead for about 5 \u2013 10 minutes. Once it\u2019s all incorporated, it shouldn\u2019t be sticky. It should feel smooth and dense, and relatively stiff. Shape it into a ball.   \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nGrease a large bowl. I used cooking spray, but oil on a paper towel will work fine. Drop your dough into the bowl and swirl it around so the sides get coated with a bit of oil. Cover, then set aside in a warm spot for an hour. (I covered mine with saran wrap and a warm, damp towel and left it on my fridge.)  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn about an hour (depending how warm your kitchen is), the dough will look very inflated/nearly doubled in size. Punch down the dough by pushing your fist into it, then gently pull the edges away from the bowl and into the centre. Dump it out onto a floured surface and knead it once or twice.   \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFor accuracy\u2019s sake, I weighed my dough and then divided it by 12, then weighed/split off each piece and set them aside on a cooking-spray\u2019d tray.   \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nRoll each piece into a loose ball, then carefully push your thumb through the center. You can also pinch your thumb/forefinger together to create a hole. Then shape your bagel \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of different ways you can do it, so whatever works for you. You can pull/stretch the dough over your fingers, or do [this]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXXtXVv948A&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=89) (1:29 \u2013 1:49). Based on the many bagel recipes I read, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s one \u201cright\u201d way to do this, so you do you.   \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nReturn your formed bagels to an oiled tray, cover them (I gave \u2018em a short blast of cooking spray then covered loosely with saran wrap) to rest/rise in a warm place for about 30 minutes.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhile they rise, preheat your oven to 375F. About halfway through your wait time, get your water started in a big pot. You should have anywhere from 4-6 inches of water in the pot. Once it\u2019s boiling, add the honey and baking soda, then turn the heat down to maintain a simmer. I found my water crept up to a boil partway through the bagel-boiling step and everything turned out fine, so as long as you don\u2019t have a really enthusiastic roiling boil going you should be OK.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPrepare your baking sheets while you wait, too \u2013 spray/oil them, then sprinkle the cornmeal. I accidentally forgot to spray one of my baking sheets and those bagels were much harder to lift off, so I think oiling is imperative here. I suspect the cornmeal is a nice touch, but not necessary. Lining your trays with parchment paper would be VERY helpful.   \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter 30 minutes, your bagels will be slightly puffy-looking and ready to boil. Drop your bagels into the boiling water so they have room to float around. Time them about 1 minute per side, flipping with a spoon or spatula. Once they\u2019re done, move them over to the oiled/cornmeal\u2019d tray. If you have toppings, add them while the bagel is still damp. I just sprinkled everything over top, but you could probably also dip the bagels (they\u2019re hot, which is why I didn\u2019t dip). At this point they look a bit weird and unappetizing - wet and wrinkly and a bit lumpy. Baking solves this!  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBake at 375F for ~20 minutes - I think I was at about 22 minutes when I pulled them out. They could\u2019ve stayed in a little longer (mine were very soft/borderline undercooked) but they\u2019d hit my ideal level of brown gorgeousness and after resting on the counter they were perfect.

Only issue is that they doesn't really melt so you'd need to spread it on your toast and put the egg on top.\n\nIf you're not into that, then I recommend just getting your favorite flavorful (so you can use less) real cheese. Either get it sliced super super thin at the deli or buy a block and a cheese slicer to shave off thin slices (use a food scale to measure out .5 oz for 50 kcal, for example).","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

I had been debating what to make for dinner this week, and when I went to the grocery store today everything I needed to buy to make this was on sale!

Place in large pot and cover in 2 in water, bring to a boil, and boil for 2 minutes.\n2. Remove from heat, let sit 1 hour.\n3. Drain water, cover with ~6 in water, then bring to a boil, lower heat, and simmer 1-1.25 hours, adding more water if necessary.\n4. Drain excess water (if any) and let cool.  Season with salt to taste.\n\nFor the cauliflower:\n \n1. Preheat oven to 425F\n2. Cut in half and remove out leaves, wash thoroughly and dry.\n3. Break florets apart (this prevents it from crumbling, which will happen if you cut it with a knife) and place in a large bowl.\n4. Drizzle with the olive oil, then coat with the allspice.\n5. Arrange in a single layer on a cookie sheet lined in parchment paper, then bake for 20 minutes.\n\nFor the eggs:\n\nThis is basically your call regarding how you like them.  I prefer my eggs very softly boiled.  Poached would have been nice as well, but I was afraid if they were too jiggly they might not keep as well.\n\nAssembly:\n\nDivide up garbanzos, cauliflower, and eggs among 6 bowls.\nTop cauliflower with 7 g each of raisins and almonds.","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

Here is how it works:\n\nIngredients\n\n- 6 to 8 oz chicken breast\n\n- 1 can artichoke hearts (quartered)\n\n- 2 cups cherry tomatoes cut in half\n\n- 1 cup cauliflower\n\n- 1 large zucchini sliced\n\n- 1 package fresh oregano\n\n- 3 teaspoons capers (bottled or canned, drained)\n\n- 2 tablespoons fresh minced garlic\n\n- 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar\n\n- 2 cups fresh arugula\n\nHow to make it:\n\nMix up your oregano, garlic and some basil spice and add fresh lemon juice. Brush the mixture on your chicken breast and marinate for 1-2 hours.\n\nNext mix up the rest of the garlic and spices into the balsamic vinegar. This will be the liquid that you pour over the vegetables and chicken before they cook.\n\nUse aluminum foil to wrap up your ingredients campfire style. Place the chicken on the foil first, and top it with all of your vegetables and your capers. Then wrap it up so that it is completely sealed and put the entire aluminum foil ball into a deep dish baking pan so that you don't have any spillage. Pour the balsamic vinegar and spices into the bundle of aluminum foil so that it runs over the vegetables and chicken.  \n\nPlace in the oven and bake for 40 minutes at 400 degrees F.\n\nServe over a bed of fresh arugula.\n\nCooking this way eliminates the need for oil or any other unhealthy additives. You are essentially steaming the chicken and vegetables in the water from the veggies and the balsamic vinegar. Each serving we calculated to be between 320 and 400 calories depending on the size of the chicken breasts. Delicious!!!\n\nIf you want less liquid on the plate you can open the aluminum foil bundle a bit and let some of the water/juice/vinegar out before serving.","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

{"body":"Hey guys, this was my dinner today. I've not been feeling too well, just really exhausted and someone suggested a good meal with some fat in it, as I eat a pretty low fat diet. It's vegetarian but you could omit the vegetarian sausages and add chicken to make it meaty and probably lower calories, I just don't have any actual meat at home! \n\n\n**The salad is made of:**\n\n\n2 Tofurky vegan kie\u0142basy (Polish style sausages),  dry fried in a griddle pan then sliced up. 307 cals (hence why I suggest it without them or chicken instead).\n\n1 salad tomato, diced. 16 cals. \n\n70g tinned sweetcorn. 56cals.\n\n40g round lettuce. 9 cals.\n\n15g rocket. 4cals.\n\n25g red onion,  sliced. 10 cals. \n\n38g fresh hass avocado,  diced.  67cals.\n\n30g Mexican salsa. I used old el paso. 13 cals\n\n5g red chilli pepper,  finely diced.  2cals.\n\n\nAnd for the best bit, Aldi goats' cheese.   30g is 64 calories and it's beautiful! 4.7g of fat,  2.9g sat fat. I know cheese is super fattening but this one is the lowest calorie one I have seen by far! I tried to find a link but there aren't any photos of it online unfortunately. It's their own brand and comes in a weird plastic case. If you wish to indulge,  it's spot on. \n\nAnd that's it! \n\nIf I was eating fewer calories today I would have eaten it without the sausages and added beetroot, but I didn't have any to hand. Hope you gain some inspiration! \n\n\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

{"body":"This article bothers me.\n\nHer first point is \"chlorine is a chemical! it's bad!\". Chloride is a necessary ion in your body. A study I found (and will cite below) says this \"Safety concerns pertaining to sucralose revolve around the fact that it belongs to a class of chemicals called organic chlorides, some types of which are toxic or carcinogenic; however, the presence of chlorine in an organic compound does not in any way ensure toxicity.\" The article further explains that the way sucralose is metabolized reduces risk, because the main concern is that the body would store chlorine. However, sucralose is insoluble in fat and therefore doesn't get stored in your fat.\n\nHer second \"myth\" isn't even busted. The myth is sucralose is zero calories. She agrees. She seems to imply that people think that adding a zero calorie sweetener will eliminate the calories in their food. Her other point is that it's 600X sweeter, which would be one legitimate reason to prefer other artificial sweeteners, but in no way relates to her \"myth\".\n\nHer third point is once again \"chemicals are bad!\" Everything is chemicals. Natural sugars and water are chemicals. See my first paragraph for why there is no evidence that sucralose is less safe than a natural sugar. To add more to this, a well written article would have provided links to her sources for those studies that show negative health risks. For all we know, the studies she mentions would fall under \"correlation does not equal causation\".\n\nReference\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3198517/#sec1-5title","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

For example, I cannot eat the big breakfasts that are (supposedly) so good for weight loss.  I hate breakfast and I refuse to spend so many worthwhile calories on the crappiest meal of the day.  If I eat half my calories at breakfast, I'm just going to be miserable for the rest of the day and regret it when I look at my 250 calorie dinner.  And then overeat for the day.

{"body":"My favorite rice is long white rice. Grew up eating it everyday, you can add it to any meal and one of the easiest to make in my opinion. The brand doesn't matter so much. I tend to enjoy Kroger brand rice (store brand) more than the expensive brands because it has less coating. \n\nI personally recommend buying a rice cooker. The brand doesn't matter and you can get one for $20 (personally, I LOVE zojirushi but any brand will do). You can technically make rice without a cooker, but if you plan on eating it as much as you say you might save yourself the time. I also suggest you purchase a 3-5 cup cooker. Anything bigger would mean you need to feed more than 5 people on a daily basis.\n\nPreparing the rice before putting it in your rice cooker is extremely important! Measure out your rice and rinse it very well. I bought a rice strainer on Amazon because normal strainers are too big. Rinsing the rice gets rid of the extra coating and makes it easier to clean your cooker afterwards. Apparently, it might rid of some calories but I wouldn't try to count it and just log regular cooked rice. Once you're done rinsing try to drain as much as possible. \n\nA good measure to go by with long white rice is for every 1 dry cup you put in 2 cups of water. (2 cups would need 4 cups of water). 1 dry cup can feed 3-4ish people. Put a SMALL dash of oil or cooking spray after you place the rice in the cooker. You can add salt then or add it afterwards.\n\nIf you wanted to do a meal prep re-heating rice is simple. Just use a wet paper towel over it and it'll be just as good as the day you made it. \n\nMy family almost always makes black beans with their rice. Black beans are DELICIOUS and you can cook them with onions/green peppers. \n\n... Well uhhh I just wrote a story about rice.

I'm recalling this from memory but this was the earliest iteration of what would one day become Halo Top (ingredients have obviously changed since then, but this should taste pretty dang close).\n\nVerdict: This ice cream was good, but not (yet) great.  Main complaint is that it just wasn't that sweet.  It was certainly vanilla and pleasant-tasting, but almost like a combination of ice cream and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche.  When I try again, I might increase the stevia or sugar (though latter would change calorie amount).\n\nAlso:\n\n* I poured the mixture from the ice cream maker into Tupperware-like containers and put those in the freezer for four hours.  The result was soupy in places and icy in others: I mixed before eating.  I've never used an ice cream maker before and wonder if there's a better way (anyone?)\n* 5g micellar casein protein powder was very little (1 teaspoon).  Could this be a typo?\n* How do I make chocolate?  :D","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

{"body":"If you're talking about the science of getting the kcal numbers that most people use to do their calculations, I would suggest researching that.\n\n\nIf you're asking how an everyday person counts their calories there are a few tools you can use. The easiest these days are apps like Lose it or My Fitness Pal where you have the option of picking from menus of popular eateries, adding your own recipes, and even scanning packages. The next thing people employ is food scales, and measuring tools to make sure the serving is correct. For example 4 oz of chicken will have less protein than 6 oz of chicken, so in order to get accurate readings you need to measure your food. If you want to do all the math manually without the apps you can look at nutrition labels which offer serving sizes and write down your items and the size you used, and add it all up yourself. The apps on the other hand *typically* are pre set to serving size so that makes them easier. However word of warning that these apps can have user generated input, so you'll want to make sure you are picking the right serving size, correct product, etc. or risk having your math off at the end of the day.m\n\n\nIt may sound tedious but honestly most people eat a pretty repetitive diet and learn what meals have what calories, and what a 4oz serving size looks like. You learn as you go, and it's far too easy to scan the bread, peanut butter, and jelly as you pull those items out of the pantry to make a sandwich and let the app do the rest.

Anyway, I've found things like a spoonful of cream cheese or sour cream can work pretty well to kill that craving.\n\nThis week, my fridge is stocked with fajita-style beef, that I've been serving with cauli rice &amp; sliced jalapenos, and let me tell you, that combo works perfectly with sour cream! \n\nI can't really comment on whether or not spicy foods directly affect my weight loss, but I'm a huge fan of variety, so firmly believe that mixing it up and eating foods that excite my senses helps me stay engaged and enthusiastic about my choices. And any \"diet\" where you're completely free to eat cream cheese off a spoon instead of dessert is always going to work for me! ","subreddit_id":"t5_37vp3","subreddit":"1200isplentyketo"}

Literally just dicing up chicken breast and pan frying with some pesto added at the end. So good.\n\n**Salsa Chicken**- again, just 10 minutes to dice and pan fry with some salsa added at the end. I like to coat the chicken in taco seasoning as well but I also am more lenient with my carb limit.\n\n**Chicken quesadilla**-5 mins- those Perdue Short Cuts( pre-cooked chicken breast) with cheese and maybe some added green peppers for filler if you want to go light on the cheese. If you've never made a quesadilla: lightly oil the pan, add the low carb tortilla, place your ingredients on over half the tortilla being sure to put cheese on the bottom then again the top to help hold it all together, then fold and pan fry just like a grilled cheese. I also really like making ham and cheese breakfast quesdillas this way as well.\n\n**Ham Pickles**- 5 mins- deli ham smeared with cream cheese or I prefer Neaufchatel to keep the calories lighter, with a pickle spear. roll it all up and you'd be amazed how good that weird combo actually tastes.\n\n**Ham Pizza**-5 mins- cheese amoutn will ovbisouly have ot vary based on your calorie allotment but just buy some deli ham sliced extra thick, spread a dab of pizza/tomato sauce, and cheese it. Stick in the toaster over for a few minutes till the cheese melts. Pan frying is probably an option as well.\n\n**Chicken Salad wrap/salad**: 5 mins but you have to pre-make the chicken salad. It's actually really easy to make your own. Just boil a chicken breast or two, shred(i have found that it tastes best when you have a 50/50 split between diced chunks and totally shredded), enough mayo(I use light mayo for calories) to get ti as moist as you like, about a 1/4 to 1/2 cup of finely diced celery, and here is the reason secret ingredient- 1-2T of honey mustard. Really makes it.   Anyway, you can keep the calories light in the wrap by obviously filling it with additional lettuce or just skip the wrap and double the chicken salad and it straight over lettuce.\n\n**Chicken dogs**- 5 mins- I love the trader joe's ones but Al Fresco is good too. 100 calories each and really good sliced and pan fried.\n\n**Spam and (scrambled)Eggs**- 5-15 mins-ratio dependent on calorie allotment obviously. If you've got the time, its best cook each seperately and combine after but you can cook the spam then toss the eggs in with it to go quicker. Can also add some broccoli or spinach to health-ify.\n\n\n\n","subreddit_id":"t5_37vp3","subreddit":"1200isplentyketo"}

{"body":"Finger food's easy and nearly always what I end up doing.  I make dip from strained yogurt, strained even longer than greek yogurt so it becomes more the texture of cream cheese, then mix in a little cream and a squeeze of lemon, then herbs... herbes de provence, or a lot of chopped fresh dill, and ground pepper.  Let it sit a couple hours and stir well before serving.  This can get stuffed into mini sweet peppers, mushrooms, celery sticks, hollowed-out cucumber cut into chunks, small tomatoes halved and hollowed out.  OR you can take egg yolks, mix them with this and put it back into the eggwhite halves for devilled eggs with a little sprinkle of black pepper or paprika on top.  If you're not being particularly formal then leave it in the jar as dip and just pile fresh cut veg around it.\n\nCherry tomatoes and nice large olives, marinated in a little olive oil with thyme/rosemary and crushed red pepper is fantastic.\n\nFruit plates.  Apples, pears, peaches, apricots, and any berries (raspberries, blackberries, blueberries) nicely arranged.  If you want a dip to make these more fancy then do this:  same superthick strained yogurt, a little cream, a squeeze of fresh lemon or lime juice, a couple packets of sweetener (a couple teaspoons' worth), vanilla extract, and a good half-teaspoon of nutmeg mixed up.  Tastes like custard.  To make this into a proper dessert instead, just layer fruit-cream-fruit in little glasses like mini trifles and like stick a half a strawberry on top.\n\nThe only difference in party meals is that you want something which works cooking in bulk.  Stuffed baked chicken breast is easy to make by the trayfull.  A big chunk of roast beef or a rolled pork loin is also easy, and any of those are basically protein as your centerpiece, then make a few side dishes which you can avoid if starchy or eat if, like, broccoli or creamed spinach.\n\ne: Of course if you are having a barbecue then the meal part is easy.  Marinate chicken legs and single-serving cuts of steak a few hours beforehand, in something with herbs for flavour, and just grill up a bunch of meat and huge mushroom caps without dousing everything in barbecue sauce.  Grilled veg is also easy, you cut eggplants in thick slices and bellpeppers in long quarters and maybe get a few cobs of corn to chop in half, then baste briefly with viniagrette while they grill.  If you're doing a potato salad then go for a vinegar-based german-syle one rather than using mayo.  And a do it yourself salad bar is the easiest way to side dish: put out bowls of little tomatoes and corn and capers and other chopped up veg, then lettuce, then maybe hard-boiled eggs and cooked bacon, and bottles of oil and vinegar.","subreddit_id":"t5_37vp3","subreddit":"1200isplentyketo"}

And then moving to Europe means there's a bunch of North African influences and ingredients to kinda jack too.  Like, supper last night was veggies night with summer squash, tomatoes, lime, paprika/cayenne, cumin, and my SO threw some garlic sausage into his.\n\nBasically, I make chili all the freaking time, and it is awesome.  Lean beef, dark meat turkey, tomatoes, bellpeppers, hot peppers (typically serrano and habanero because they also taste good), a handful of carrots and celery, a can of kidney or black beans because I am an unrepentant Californian heathen, a bottle of dark beer, a bunch of BBQ spice and poultry spice, soy sauce, tomato paste, mustard.  Simmer for like six hours (or do in a slow-cooker on low all day).  One half-bowl is *filling* like you would not believe and leaves you happy for ages, especially if you dollop it with some strained greek yogurt and fresh cilantro on top.  Doesn't need anything bready alongside, either.\n\nYou're right, throwing spice (properly done, not just willy-nilly) into food makes it much more satisfying in smaller amounts.  Look up spanish tortilla, which is an egg dish and can be made without the potatoes like a spanish-flavour quiche instead.  Smoked paprika is awesome and makes anything with eggs in it taste like about twice as much as it is.\n\nFor Indian flavours now I mostly make a garam masala spice blend, then use nonfat milk and a pinch of cornstarch and extra turmeric (because bright yellow food), and then simmer broccoli and cauliflower and unmelty cheese like Halloumi in the sauce.

Bodyfat doesn't provide all the essential amino acids and micronutrients needed for long-term health so make sure you are getting enough protein, fiber and high-quality veg but beyond that, there's no need to eat calories just because you feel you ought to hit that magic 1200 number.\n\nAs a short woman desk jockey myself, 1000ish works pretty well most days if I'm not that active.

{"body":"Planning ahead really helped for me... And I am talking days ahead. I already know what foods I am eating for every meal on Thursday and have since Monday... I often tweak them throughout the week, based on what I feel like eating, but having those numbers laid out right in front of me is key for me.\n\nUnder twenty carbs is a firm goal... protein is a pretty firm goal, but slightly flexible (5 under, 5 over, etc). Fat is really just there to make sure I get enough calories, not a goal to be met. \n\nI have the same thing for breakfast everyday, which is my coffee... Not bulletproof or anything, just almond milk and erythritol. I have almost the same snacks with my husband every night while we watch a show, which is either a Kirkland protein bar and cello wisps, or Halo Top and wisps... Protein bar is like 20g of protein, wisps are 9 per serving, Halo Top is 12 I think (we budget for a double serving when we have it).  So now I have lunch and dinner to make up the rest.  Lunch is generally eggs, tuna, chicken, or a chef salad.  Dinner is some cut of meat with veggies or a salad.  If I am under 1k calories, I fill in with pure fat (mayo, butter, etc).\n\nThe more I do it, the more I can figure out what works. And planning so far ahead allows me to work in meals out, special dishes, or special treats. We end up eating a lot of the same things, but that makes cooking and grocery shopping easier.\n\nWell, that took a long time to write out in between getting kids ready for school!

For the cheese, I used Cabot Sharp Light Cheese* (found at Whole Foods). \n\nI arrived at my numbers by splitting this recipe into 8 servings. When I make a recipe, I log it into MyFitnessPal as I go, so that means if the recipe calls for 8 oz and I end up measuring 8.1 oz, that's what goes in.

Still 7g carb though. \n\nThe calorie to protein ratio on this bad boy is 6.75, which means this is a keeper.

But it's also cool to discover the red tea can transfer your consciousness to different parts of you in time. \nBack to the subject, your believe of Jennifer's abilities as a primary and mine differ but we know her impact. She is able to see scenarios in time so she can instruct Cole on how to change it. She had a set time to die on the witness map, but she wasn't a primary that was sought after to kill. So that enabled her to have a greater impact on Cole, a much better guide to help him change the course of time for the better. The primary in 1959 have done something similar to what Jennifer had done and instructed Cole how to change the outcome of that the paradox caused in 1957. She had knowledge of the events in Titan, as well as the other time lines of other primaries. So she has knowledge just like Jennifer and could have made a similar impact if she was placed in a time period to have that impact. This show... Season 3 will answer a lot because we know the witness does have a physical body but he also seem to exist in people's mind.

{"body":"&gt;Anna saw Titan, then it disappeared and reappeared.*\n\nHannah went to the coordinates for Titan and it *wasn't* there. I believe that's the main reason Jennifer and the Daughters didn't continue on the journey originally. I think the Bleeder mentioned other people seeing lights at that location and never returning from checking it out, so it sounds like Titan *had* been there previously. Whether it had travelled to the future or past, and returned, makes a good case for it being able to travel back in time.\n\n&gt;More proof, Jennifer was sent back in time using Titan's technology.\n\nThat's a good point, but it *was* just after Jennifer damaged a section of the machine with gunfire. It's possible her jumping back was a accident and couldn't be replicated (like when Cole jumped back a few days in season 1 due to machine damage). However, The Witness supposedly ends up in the early 20th century (per his work with Kirschner), so backwards time travel seems likely. \n\nAs to why Titan wasn't used for the Messengers originally... Titan is huge and would probably be noticed if it was popping up in a largely populated world. Can you imagine the headlines if someone saw Titan appear in the middle of WWII? Or during the Cold War? The Witness may have intentionally moved the Messengers through the Splinter facility so Cassie and Cole would get involved in hunting them, eventually leading to their time together in 1959 and his conception.","subreddit_id":"t5_31827","subreddit":"12Monkeys"}

They have the smaller machines to send people back if needed to get food, medicine etc. but the city is mainly a sanctuary so they would want it always protected.

It does have a good flow though.\n\nIt also has day/night cycle, snow/rain/sun. And some enemies can be more powerful depending on what it is doing. And depending on ring you can be weaker or more powerful.\nAlso once game is beat I think there is stuff you can get or do during certain weather combinations only (you can control the weather) and not only that there are challenge levels and stones you can do as well once the game ends.\n\nCollectibles each level and every zone (not like most games.

{"body":"&gt;Has anyone else played any of the \"Sim\" games? What are some notable ones that aren't made by Sid Meier?\n\nDo you mean the Sims games? None of them were by Meier, the series was created by Will Wright. I'm not sure what games beyond the first he had a hand in, despite playing them all. The second one was the one I had the most fun with. I remember the the wife of my founder for the generation challenge burned dinner once. The founder talked about it with everyone for the rest of his life, and his kids, and his grandkids, and his great-grandkids. I'm sure the next generation would have too, except I got bored with the family and moved on by then. However, three is the one that I felt was the most playable.\n\nOr do you mean sim games in general? I'm sure lots of good ones aren't made by Meier. In fact the only real sim games of his I can think of are pretty old. I tend to think more of strategy games when I think of him. Probably because I was a real big fan of the Civ series. \n\nAs to sim games I like, there's Euro Truck Simulator 2 recently. And I suppose that Kerbal Space Program sorta fits.","subreddit_id":"t5_3bimc","subreddit":"12in12"}

{"body":"Completed some things from my backlog so I'm happy.\n\n**Alice: Madness Returns - Steam - Action/Adventure/Insanity**, always played it after 1 AM for some reason, but it works late at night. Such sweet imagery before bedtime... But holy crap it looked good. The most consistent thing was the amazing art direction as it was spot on every. Single. Time. Only got better as it progressed and made for some memorable levels, Chapters 4 and 5 in particular. Also a random note, Chapter 4's intro Cardsbridge was amazingly chill. All jumping puzzles and no enemies was magnificent.\n\nAnd find a guide to edit the .int or something files to get the DLC dresses. Some of them have really great effects and the weapon changes, god-like. But damn the dresses look fine! Another part of the art direction but the dresses and Alice herself were gorgeous. Changing every chapter if you let the story dictate what Alice wears was a nice touch and her hair, god damn that is some fine physics right there.\n\nI'm really rambling but to end it, it was worth the $5 CAD I paid for it on a Steam Sale years ago. Has some performance issues and the cancer known as EA which forces you to get Origin and register it on there before you can play it but with those problems, it's a solid game.\n\n**Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel - Steam - FPS**\n\nHmm. Preferred Borderlands 2 but DLC Doppleganger Jack does make for a good solo run. Season Pass wasn't worth it as Holodome was kinda crap and haven't finished the Campaign DLC yet. It was good, but not great. Crud ton of back-tracking, some annoying enemies late-game and final boss was wicked easy once you learn to time your jumps. Don't feel a real urge to play True Vault Hunter Mode or that mode after the regular game so will probably be done with it when I finish the DLC.\n\n**Call of Juarez - Gunslinger - Steam - FPS/Western**\n\nStill unfinished but I made progress at least. In the mines and I do better when I'm cheesed as I started to rack up some wicked kill combos. But getting better as I get back into FPS games. Can't shoot dynamite for the life of me so thinking of just rushing anybody who throws that crap.\n\n**Hocus Pocus - Steam - 90s Platformer from makers of Clyde's Revenge**\n\nI... don't know why. Beat episode 1 and it's not even 90 minutes, despite spending time to get it to go full-screen and even dying once or twice. Some solid controls with the 360 controller, still good platforming, nostalgia up the wazoo with the first episode and could never forget the White Potion. You become death, and that nostalgic feeling of being a god is as great as ever.\n\n**Etrian Odyssey Untold - 3DS - RPG/Dungeon Crawler/Cartography/Kick in the Nuts Difficulty**\n\nPicked it back up and got my ass kicked in the second random battle as a dude one-shotted two members per turn.","subreddit_id":"t5_3bimc","subreddit":"12in12"}

Of course he won't be as good as Kaser since he was one of the best we've ever had, but from practice reports it sounds like he'll be a fine college punter.\n\nThe freshman on the offensive line is the most pressing thing I think, though it was pretty much expected from the last couple days of practice reports. Its just what we're reaping from BJ Anderson's crappy recruiting and coaching for a couple years, and something we have to deal with. I'm just glad its Jim Turner teaching them, so I'll expect to see them improve as the season goes on. I'm also glad he moved Eluemunor back to RT, where he was always supposed to be. Hopefully with the two seniors who are both natural tackles (unlike Ifedi being forced over there last year), we can see an improvement in pass blocking. The younger guys are going to be forced to improve in a hurry though.\n\nI also think we shouldn't read too much into the 1st and 2nd team listings on the D-line, since we're going to be rotating guys constantly. I wouldn't be surprised if the playing time split between 1st and 2nd team is basically 50/50, because that's easily one of our deepest position groups.\n\nI'm also glad we finally have 3 scholarship linebackers to man a 4-3, all of which have shown good playmaking ability.

{"body":"&gt;I don't want to sound overly critical of the O line though.  They weren't terrible, just not great. \n\nI would 100% say they were terrible. they allowed so much penetration up front that the non-mobile QB was constantly under duress and we had a meh rushing attack. that's just straightup bad OL play\n\n&gt;From what I have read of Mazzone's offense, we can expect much of the same. Hopefully the coaching is just better, in terms of instruction, discipline and execution.  We had so many screen passes last couple of years because that was a safety valve - Mazzone treats it the same way.  With luck, we won't need to use that safety valve so much.  Without luck, we are...out of luck.\n\nI mean it's similar in that he uses screens pretty heavily but otherwise it's not that Spav-tastic. it's not air raid, it's actually all founded on running the ball and spreading the defense sideline to sideline and creating space rather than making quick reads in a hurry-up spread offense with a supplemental rushing attack...or that's at least how Spav's offense struck me \n\nbasically, Knight is gonna run some zone reads, he's gonna let Keith Ford do the dirty work, he's gonna crank out some super quick screen passes, and he's gonna make some quick reads to fire the ball out (that can also include some run-pass option which I'm really curious to see). the emphasis will be on getting the ball out quickly and playing fast to keep the defense a little worn out and let the athletes get the ball as soon as possible without our OL becoming a major liability.

Like leaving guys completely unblocked to have a free shot at the QB.\n\nFootball, and QB especially, is a confidence game.

I think our QBs were worried too much about being hit and started getting rid of the ball too quickly in order to avoid problems.\n\nA change at QB should help out a lot. \n\nHaving watched a bit of UCLA from last year I think things will be different.  He seems to be much better about making calls that are smart against defenses.  He isn't Kliff, but he seems to have a better grasp than Spav ever did.\n\nHe has consistently put up top 15 offenses at UCLA, and I hope it continues at A&amp;M ... but we will be playing better defenses than he is used to facing.","subreddit_id":"t5_2wjlu","subreddit":"12thMan"}

Thankfully, our receiving corps is still killer even without him in the rotation.\n-I was expecting Mack to start at DT, but I'm sure he and Walker will rotate a lot throughout the game.

Looks like there was a Flying Castle, and it burnt down. You're the only person to escape Mr. Bones Wild ~~Ride~~ Carnival of Horror? Looks like somewhere in the campaign world, there is a Mr. Bones Wild Carnival that keeps people against their will.\n\nThe best OUTs that I have seen have a few things in common:\n\n* They start with \"The only ____ ... \"\n* They interact with or create something in the campaign world\n* They flagrantly violate \"canon\" interacting with major movers and shakers in the world\n* They are not finished, there is more left to do, to discover, or happen\n\nOne of my hands-down favorite OUTs was in a 13th Age game set in the Eberron campaign setting - and if you're familiar with the setting much, you'll understand why it's such an interesting OUT:\n\n\"I am the long lost son of King Kaius III\".

It allows the user to create an entire encyclopedia of information related to the game, including images, catagories, groups, text, and more.  The plot points from above can actually be linked to the encyclopedia entries.\n\nThis means that I have a picture of the stat block attached to every encyclopedia entry of note, and I just link that entry to my combat encounters for easy access to stats.\n\nIt allows you to log exactly what your player characters are (although you may need to be a little creative since it's based around 4e), it has a whole section for miscellaneous notes, a series of random generators, and the ability to send information to a separate 'player window' which you can use for projection or screen sharing if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nThat's my two cents, anyway!\n\n-TMG","subreddit_id":"t5_2xyuo","subreddit":"13thage"}

{"body":"&gt; What are some characteristics of a very good or very bad OUT?\n\nI don't think that there are direct characteristics. I'd say that the only ones which are bad are those which add little to the character. Otherwise, whether they're impactful on the entire story, or just add flavour to a character, they do what they should: add something interesting. For example: let's take a look at some OUTs from my current campaign\n\nThere is a Druid who has the following OUT: \"I like talking to trees and other plants. In fact: I love talking to them so much that whenever I am having a conversation, I cannot stop.\" It's not necessarily unique or impactful in the story, but that's fine. I know that player doesn't like to be in the spotlight and would rather be on the sidelines aiding the party. Furthermore: it has led to some nice interactions, where the party is trying to advance the plot, but the Druid is paying not attention, because he's talking with an old oak about how the weather was nicer back in the old days, and that squirrels didn't gnaw on you as much.\n\nThe fighter, who is a master tailor, is so renowned that he has made clothes for the Elven Queen, and even, though unwittingly, the Lich King. I absolutely adore this one. Not only does it tell a lot about the character, and create some good story moments, but he uses it to explain his Icon relationships too.\n\nThen there's the Chaos Mage, whose OUT is both simple and incredibly complex: her power comes from one of the Icons, but she does not know which one. Although it's less flavorful in the short run, it does allow me some huge freedom in the story. And I know that this player likes intrigue and story, so having his reveal be important is something that he'll like.\n\nThe common factor between these is that all of them shape their character and/or the world around them in interesting ways. And that, I think, is the sign of a good OUT.","subreddit_id":"t5_2xyuo","subreddit":"13thage"}

{"body":"13th Age tends to \"front load\" these customizations within a class. In many ways, talents are the paragon paths and epic destinies of 13th Age. A few classes (Ranger, Paladin, Fighter, Monk, ...) get talents at higher levels, and in a way these high level talents are their paragon paths / epic destinies.\n\nFor classes that don't get additional talents, you could still write up paragon path / epic destiny talents, just make them switch-out talents.\n\nFor example, let's take the classic 3E prestige class Dragon Disciple (http://www.d20srd.org/srd/prestigeClasses/dragonDisciple.htm). Let's also say we want to make this a sorcerer talent, since this is the class closest to draconic magic in the lore. Also, sorcerers already cast dragon breath spells.\n\nHere's how I'd do it: I create a new Sorcerer talent \"Dragon Disciple\". It's an epic talent, so sorcerers can choose to switch out any one talent for this at 8th level.\n\nLooking at the Dragon Disciple, the core abilities are: claws and bite (not that relevant for a sorcerer), wings (awesome) and gaining the half-dragon template. He also gains a bunch of numerical bonuses that are very cool on paper (but suck in 3E because only spellcaster levels count...). Bringing all these bonuses to a 13th Age Sorcerer would break the game in half...\n\nAll in all, the talent would\n\n* give bite and natural armor at 8th level\n* give wings at 9th level\n* make the character a half-dragon at 10th level (not sure how to express that in 13th Age)\n* reduce the number of sorcerer spell slots by 1 to balance it out\n\nAlso see these Paladin talents for something similar:\nhttp://13thage.org/index.php/abilities/384-paladin-champion-talent","subreddit_id":"t5_2xyuo","subreddit":"13thage"}

This is a wild card slot. When you prepare spells in the morning, you designate one slot as \"the utility spell slot\". You can use that slot to cast any single one of your utility spells that day.\n\nIn essence, it gives you a chance to solve a problem when it arises, with any utility spell in the list, instead of blocking your spell slots with all sorts of situational spells that may or may not come in handy that day.","subreddit_id":"t5_2xyuo","subreddit":"13thage"}

{"body":"/u/Leinenkugels appreciate you holding me accountable!!\n\nAfter arriving in Colorado on Tuesday night, my girlfriend and I woke up at 4 am and were out the door in our breckenridge airbnb at 4:50 am. We were very scared of the doing the East slopes as the 14 miles were staring right at us so we thought let us choose our battles and hike the southwest slopes.\n\nTrailhead to Mount Massive is easy to do even with a sedan. Getting to the N. Halfmoon Creek was a little tricky even in a Jeep Compass and I had to park the car .4 miles short of the trailhead as there are two large potholes sitting beneath an elevated surface where water is running below. ( you can't miss it!) I am sure some experts could handle it but coming from new jersey and using a rental I said, lets play it safe.\n\nWe got to the trailhead at 7 am and started our ascent. \n\nAround 8:45 am, rain began to fall constantly and as we hiked up further it came down harder. Because this was our first hike, altitude was an extreme issue for me, I found myself wheezing and catching my breath. As we kept on climbing up we were facing extreme inclement weather, high winds, heavier winds, and 30 degree weather probably 500 feet below the wooden sign that connects both the east and southwest trails near the summit.\n\nWe finally made it that sign and climbed a little further by hands another 50-75 feet in elevation. At that time, weather was very extreme and was blanketing everything at the top of the mountain. We could not even see 30 yards in front of us due to the cloud formation. \n\nI would be lying if I told you that I was not disappointed at what I found at that elevation, absolutely no views of anything! But I guess that is just mother nature and you will always lose to her in the end. We made it to around 14,300 feet at 12:20 pm took a picture, caught our breath and headed back down the southwest trails. We made it back to the the car which was .4 miles past the trailhead at 2 pm. I feel like we made amazing time but that is not with us reaching the true summit or us spending more than 2 minutes at the top cause of the rain.\n\nInfo about the trail: trail is marked clearly with the man-made rock formations alongside the trail (forget the technical name), no snow. When you get to around the 11,300 mark, this was the most painful part of the hike as you are gaining much elevation in a short period of time.\n\nOverall, despite it not working out the way I wanted it to go, I am extremely satisfied and happy by the result. I kept telling my girlfriend that Mount Massive was the most physical pain I have ever taken in my life and I consider myself pretty active and it took a lot of mental strength not to back down at around 13800 when we were battling the weather.\n\nI am writing this about 6 hours after hiking and I can't feel my legs  and have a massive headache which is all worth it. Altitude is a real thing and I honestly did not give it enough credit it deserves. New Jersey is like only 500-800 if that above sea level.\n\nThank you for letting me share my story with you all today. It's amazing we only saw 2 groups the whole time on the trail and 1 gentlemen who passed us on the way up and passed us on the way down was giving us much needed motivation and was impressed we made it that far considering all the factors. The other group I felt were being kinda dicks and were discouraging us from reaching the summit by telling us it was \"way too cold\" which was true but fuck the cold man,  you don't get to do this shit everyday.\n\nthanks.","subreddit_id":"t5_2srvd","subreddit":"14ers"}

I had 0 issues but I'm also used to driving shit roads so I am not easily phased, where some people seem to think this road is basically extreme offroading.","subreddit_id":"t5_2srvd","subreddit":"14ers"}

{"body":"+1 for 14ers.com. The further west and south you go, the less crowds you will see on the mountains.

If you draw double that current (6800 mA), it will only deliver for half an hour. This is 2C. If you draw half (1700 mA) it will last for two hours. This is 0.5C. A battery with a higher C-rate will be able to deliver (or accept) a higher current than a lower C battery, even though their capacities may be the same.

The post you're responding to is an insult to people who spend a lot of hard earned money on their high end 1911s.\n\nIf you fall in love with it, whenever your budget allows, you should definitely look at some high end guns.

{"body":"&gt;Angle of the frame would be unlike any other 1911, so it would probably require new to develop and proprietary parts that wouldn't be interchangeable with standard 1911s or the current double stack models.\n\nA Glock brand Glock frame has a different angle, yes. But I don't think that constraint is the fault of the magazine. There's other guns that take the same magazine, be it LWD Timber Wolfs or Kel Tec Sub2ks, that have steeper grip angles. Setting a Glock mag on top of a 1911's grip makes it look like it the existing grip angle would be fine.\n\n&gt;Would be easier to share mags with something like the smith and Wesson m&amp;p, or some offering from sig, but then the sti and para ones hold 14 rounds of 45 and mp holds 10.\n\nIf it was easy to get an AR lower in whatever pistol magazine you wanted, then yeah, I wouldn't even be interested in this.

All the things you listed are separate components that \"YOU\" feel need to be changed, yet you did not include some of the most CRUCIAL parts that are prone to wear, such as the hammer, barrel link, ejector, sear, and some may even argue the disco. All of these put you well over $400 for Wilson Bulletproof parts. $100 to get all these things fitted? All I can say is you get what you pay for and even then, I don't find this number you've responded with is remotely accurate among decent gunsmiths.\n\n2. Price is crucial to the comparison of the tiers of guns you're paying for, yes, but the guns are still leagues different from one another. Price does not quantify quality nor is it directly correlated to a gun being \"better\". Sometimes that is the case, but much of the time, it is not. You said if all of the said guns were \"upgraded\" equally they would run just as proper/reliable with no differences. This is completely untrue, because you can't put the same amount of work into each pistol and expect the same results with all the different problems each will run into that AREN'T covered in your list of upgrades.\n\n3. My comment about frames being true to spec are directly correlated to YOUR suggestion on upgrades. If you are buying bullet proof parts or any part from a reputable and high quality company, you will be getting parts that are TRUE TO SPEC. If you put those TRUE TO SPEC parts in your NOT TRUE TO SPEC gun, then you're gonna have a bad time.

{"body":"The goal is to achieve what you believe to be a reliable gun that won't have abrupt failures. To include only the parts you listed would not make a pistol completely reliable. Hammers and sears see the most stress with the exception of a slide stop. When you get have two objects smashing into one another time after time, something will give, especially depending on the materials they were made out of as well as the process in which they are created. That much we agree on.\n\nExcept the differences are not \"largely cosmetic\". Functionally, they're all different in respect to the blueprints of the frames and slides. For example, how true is the disco hole, location of sear and hammer pins, and down to how true the firing pin channel is. So, functionally, they are not the same, because of these things they will all run different enough that you would not find the root problem of each pistol to be \"the same\" or \"similar\" for that matter. So with that said, whether it is Series 70 or Series 80, no 1911 across different manufacturers are equal or \"the same\". If we throw a blanket solution between the three companies we've been talking about, they will all yield different results. Separate components do not address separate issues. Everything is relative.\n\nNone of the parts are drop-in, correct, but it DOES matter if the gun is true to spec, which is defined as being true to the original blueprints of Brownings original design in regards to dimension (tolerances, as you said).

{"body":"I don't know how much time you've spent working on 1911s professionally or shooting the shit with full-time 1911 pistolsmiths but I've done both quite a bit and I can say, anecdotally mind you, that sears and hammers fail abruptly very rarely outside of blatant abuse. Slide stops and thumb safeties fail all the time. Extractors fail (to extract) all the time, as a result of clocking or poor tuning. Often straight out of the box. I'm not saying you're wrong but I am speaking from substantial experience.\n\nI'll break down the functional vs cosmetic thing even further. If the firing pin channel in a Ruger has a different clearance than one in a Wilson but both facilitate a primer strike as intended, this is a cosmetic difference. If the slide-to-frame tolerance is different but both guns cycle as intended, this is a cosmetic difference. Sig's slide profile is way 'out of spec' but it's strictly cosmetic. The mechanisms are all the same. In contrast, A series 80 action functions fundamentally different than a series 70 action. An external extractor functions fundamentally different. *These* are functional differences.\n\nYou can't expect *complete reliability* from anything on this earth but once you've seen numerous race guns with 30-50k+ rounds through them, you see a pattern in what fails.

{"body":"1) Not all parts fit your 1911, and most 1911 parts are not drop-in parts and require fitting. Some of the parts and their fit are determined by the type of 1911 (Series 70 vs 80), and presence or absence of a beavertail. You're going to have to research each part individually. Even a bushing requires custom fitting, or it should. \n2) I would shoot it quite a lot before I changed anything, but the first thing I replace on a mass produced 1911 are the trigger internals, including the sear and mainspring housing. I usually like Wilson Combat or Ed Brown parts. I also very immediately replace the extractor and go to a pinned ejector.\n3) I think comps are totally unnecessary on anything but a competition gun. Same with compensated semi-autos like Glock, and even then, I usually like unported guns, to stay within more fun classes. \n4) There are a number of resources that go over field stripping and also detail stripping. A good tinkering project is changing the extractor, because you can get your first taste of tuning one, and that is one of the most useful field skills to have.\n5) I would recommend TiN parts. It is just a titanium nitrite coating: http://titaniumgun.com/coating-services/ Etailers might sell precoated parts, but I'd just buy over oversized, 'melted' parts and send them in to get coated.

{"body":"In some ways it's better, and in some ways just different. The parts quality on the Brown is better (all forged or bar stock). The cosmetics on the Brown is also better (all the little edges line up perfectly, the blending is perfect, the tiny little details like the serrated slide top are perfect, etc). \n\nThat said, the Baer is really good in those areas too, just not *quite* as good. The parts quality is great, but there are a few cast parts in low-stress areas (except the cast slide stop, that's the only one that I think Baer really shouldn't use). The cosmetics/blending is very good, but just not as seemless as the Brown. Baer also does almost everything by hand, so there are \"imperfections\" here and there. They don't look bad at all, just not as \"clinically\" perfect as the Brown. \n\nOne area they are different, but not really better or worse, is the overall feel and fitting of the gun. The Baer is tighter. All the parts just barely fit together. You absolutely need a bushing wrench. There's also evidence of extensive hand fitting inside the gun. It has a very \"old school\" custom 1911 feel to it. The Brown has clean machining versus the Baer's hand fitting. There are absolutely no machining marks anywhere on the gun, inside or out. Instead of being super tight, it's just snug all around. \n\nBoth guns are fantastic 1911s. Both are reliable and accurate, to the point that you can't tell a difference short of putting them in a Ransom Rest. They do have very different \"character\" though. \n\nTo be fair, since we're comparing them, the Brown cost about $1300 more than the Baer. ","subreddit_id":"t5_3a0xc","subreddit":"1911fans"}

{"body":"My new Colt Combat Unit Rail Gun just came in, and before even taking it home it went straight to the range for a [feeding of 202 rounds](http://i.imgur.com/Rw1YkGQ.jpg).  This is my first series 80 1911, and I have to say I can tell the difference.  There is a little bit of creep to the trigger before a very nice break.  Still overall a very nice trigger.  The gun is straight up built like a tank.  After handling and firing it it's easy to tell how this thing was able to pass military testing.  It's a dam heavy gun, and that weight paired with the two recoil springs makes it a very soft shooting gun.  Also the [25 LPI Colt Custom Shop checkering](http://i.imgur.com/cNLhMo4.jpg), and undercut trigger guard really help lock it into your hand.  This all helps the [NM barrel](http://i.imgur.com/dk5X1uI.jpg) and the guns great accuracy shine.  [Here's a 7 round group at about 10 yards](http://i.imgur.com/hPX0FLu.jpg).\n\nThe sights are just what I like, black rear and very visible front.  The fit and finish is great, but it is definitely a tighter gun.  It doesn't have the usual Colt battle rattle, minus the grip safety which does have some rattle. The action however is extremely smooth.  The thumb safety is very stiff out of the box, but is staring to break in, and it's very crisp and clean.\n\nOver those 202 rounds I had 2 misfeeds, including the third shot I took.  But I knew right away that just like my Wiley Clapp it was the extractor that turned out to be tensioned to about 8oz..  So I have it now at about 26-27oz. and don't expect any more problems.  I think it says something about the gun though that the extractor could be so under-tensioned and still only have 2 misfeeds.\n\nOverall so far so good, and the gun seems like a great [battle 1911](http://i.imgur.com/NOPY1SO.jpg).

{"body":"I took my [1944 Remington Rand M1911A1](http://i.imgur.com/THDLpUF.jpg) to the range with my [Colt Combat Unit Rail Gun](http://i.imgur.com/RJUKjdm.jpg) for a little comparing and contrasting of two war horses.  Now the Remington is an actual WW2 1911 while the CURG isn\u2019t an actual military 1911 but is basically the M45A1 that is being used by MARSOC currently.\n\nIn shooting these two side by side there are a few differences that are the most noticeable.\n\n* The A1s round trigger definitely isn\u2019t as comfortable as the flat face on the CURG.  200 rounds through the Remington wouldn\u2019t be the most pleasant shooting experience.\n* Modern 1911\u2019s have better triggers, simple as that.  When Remington, Colt, Ithica, USS, and Singer were pumping these guns out precision match grade triggers weren\u2019t exactly the highest priority.  The A1 does have a good single action trigger.  It just isn\u2019t as crisp, clean, and light as modern production guns like the CURG.   \n* Arched mainspring housing on the A1 vs. flat on the CURG.  This is really personal preference.\n* The sights are one of the biggest difference makers on these guns.  Low and dark on the A1 vs. precise and visible on the CURG.  And with the tritium insert front sight on the CURG (as well as a 1913 rail for a light) low light is possible, while it\u2019s extremely difficult with the A1.\n* Accuracy has come a long way since 1944 for 1911s.  Barrel quality and fitment, sights, and the trigger among other factors have transformed the already fairly accurate M1911A1 into a competition accurate gun.  At 10 yards I could shoot about 3-5\u201d groups with the A1, while my CURG was shooting about [2-3\u201d groups](http://i.imgur.com/tLHlCah.jpg).  Both are plenty accurate for a combat pistol, but the CURG does it a lot easier.\n* Front strap checkering and an undercut trigger guard help control the CURG for quick follow-up shots.  Front strap checkering isn\u2019t present on the M45 or the A1 but is on the CURG and it\u2019s a really nice addition to help keep the gun locked into your hand when firing. \n* The A1 style beavertail grip safety is really the last really noticeable difference while shooting.  Without the memory bump at the bottom you really have to make sure you have a good grip on the gun to actuate it.  I have never gotten trigger bite with it but maybe if you have really big hands it could potentially be a problem.\n\nOther differences between the guns include parkerized vs. ionbond finish, less recoil with the CURG (mainly due to the gun being much heavier with its big beefy rail), and the overall [fit, finish, and parts quality](http://i.imgur.com/cfS1Aly.jpg) of the guns.  Proof load tested, Magnafluxed national match barrels obviously weren\u2019t an option at the time in WW2, but now that we have them it\u2019s a pretty nice step up.  Everything is much cleaner and better fit on the CURG.  It was built to withstand immense torture and lack of care.   And overall it is a much nicer 1911 to shoot.  However when it comes down to the guns purpose of reliably putting rounds down range, both will do the job.  Now sure, in a war zone the CURG like the M45A1 is going to have a considerable leg up with everything I\u2019ve mentioned.  But for a day at the range both will put rounds where you want them to go.  I didn\u2019t have a single malfunction with either pistol during my range visit.\n\nFor a piece of American history that you can actually use and have fun with it\u2019s hard to beat an original M1911A1.  And for overall shootability, modern usefulness, and a gun you can shoot through hell and back the Combat Unit Rail Gun is the way to go.  In the end both have their uses and both are a lot of fun to shoot.       \n","subreddit_id":"t5_3a0xc","subreddit":"1911fans"}

{"body":"I have a Sig so I will speculate as to why they use them, I have never heard anyone from Sig say why anywhere so I can't say for sure. Most modern guns use an external extractor, including some guns designed by John Moses Browning, the reason for that is that you don't have to fuck with extractor tension. I find that one of the most likely reasons some one is having issues with a 1911 is the extractor being the wrong amount of tension. On my Norinco and my Shooters Arms Manufacturing 1911's I had extractor tension problems. On my Sig I have no issues, at all. Smith and Wesson also uses external extractors and they did a lot of r&amp;d on theirs (according to them anyways). From what I understand Kimber used external extractors for a little bit but it failed, although I am not surprised as it is Kimber... With everything else that has been said by myself and others the last thing I can think of is that the 1911 having an internal extractor was a requirement of the military. I can't confirm that but hopefully someone has a link to something other than a forum. Both should work completely fine, my preference is the external extractor.","subreddit_id":"t5_3a0xc","subreddit":"1911fans"}

{"body":"I think some of it is Sig just trying to differentiate themselves. Which with the massive number of \"1911s\" on the market, is pretty cool. I think there is also the perception that they are more reliable, however I disagree with that. A properly tensioned bar stock extractor is perfectly reliable and will stay that way for 10s of thousands of rounds. There are advantages and disadvantages to it I guess. \n\nPros:\n\n* Probably cheaper. You can injection mold the extractor, and the spring provides the tension. Cheaper part and no time needed to adjust it. \n* Easier to replace when it breaks. Again, no adjustment necessary. \n* Extractor can serve as a loaded chamber indicator. Not sure if Sig actually does this, but HK does on most of their handguns. \n\nCons:\n\n* Has to be held in by a roll pin. Another part added to the list, and you can no longer take the slide apart without tools. \n* Has to be tensioned with a spring. Another part added to the list. \n* Since the firing pin safety (which isn't mandatory, but Sig uses one) is held in by the internal extractor normally, they have to use a dummy internal extractor for that. So where 1 part (internal extractor) used to do the job, you now have 4 parts doing the same thing (external extractor, spring, roll pin, dummy internal extractor). \n* Few, if any, aftermarket replacements. Break an internal extractor, or it's poorly fit, or worn, or whatever, and you have dozens of high quality aftermarket replacement options that require a little fitting, but will all work. Break the external extractor, and you have a lot less options. \n\nLike most things, it's a little bit of a trade off. I think on Sigs they tend to work well, so you probably can't go wrong either way. Might be fun to spice things up with some variety...","subreddit_id":"t5_3a0xc","subreddit":"1911fans"}

{"body":"It's an awesome gun. Easily on par with my Baer and my dad's Ed Brown, and better in some ways. \n\nIt doesn't use a plastic mainspring housing. It's a custom machined one done by Pete Single to match the 20 LPI front strap checkering. It also has a roundish butt. It's machined from bar stock stainless steel. \n\nEven the standard Special Combat Governments have steel mainspring housings. They are cast carbon steel Smith and Alexander magwells. \n\nMore models are getting front strap checkering. Mine (pictured) has it, but it's also a 1/100 Custom Shop run. Most recently the new Combat Unit Rail Gun got front strap checkering (25 LPI by Pete Single). They could definitely do it on more models, but it's also a preference thing. Some people prefer not to have it. \n\nAmbi safeties are *especially* a preference thing. I'm willing to pay more to have a single side safety. That said, there are definitely Colt production models that have ambis. Also, the standard Special Combat Government comes with a Novak ambi safety, which is by far the best designed ambi you can buy (none of that tongue and groove crap in the middle where the safeties connect). \n\nThe sear and disconnector are MIM, not cast. While I'd prefer them to be bar stock, they are very high quality parts (I've never heard of either of them failing) that a lot of gunsmiths choose to use over other brands. \n\nThat said, my gun has all forged or bar stock parts (this particular special run was spec'd that way), 20 LPI checkering, night sights, hard fit NM barrel, a silly good trigger, etc. But it also cost significantly more than a \"standard\" Special Combat Government. \n\nWhile it seems DW has recently gotten past their galling issues, their quality control is pretty far behind where it should be still. They do, however, seem to stand by their products, and they use really great quality parts as well. \n\nFor $1800, if it were me, I'd be looking almost exclusively at Les Baer.

{"body":"I love it. I love the Baer too, obviously (I wouldn't shoot it so much if I didn't), but I honestly think I prefer the Colt. The 20 LPI checkering is awesome, the high blended beavertail is awesome, the trigger is really good and I think will get even better with some wear, and the finish is perfect. Nice dark black, and just about bullet proof. The gun is just about perfect. \n\nThe only thing I'd probably change if I had spec'd the gun myself would be a bar stock extended magwell. That's super minor though, and the frame magwell is beveled generously. \n\nThere is definitely a little battle rattle between the frame and slide. Typical Colt clearances there. I absolutely would not call it sloppy at all, it's just not tight. The back of the frame/slide is blended well, same for ejector. You can tell they didn't cut any corners, they consciously made the decision to stick with the proper clearances between the slide and frame. Again, not sloppy, but not tight. Just right. \n\nDespite the classic fighting-gun battle rattle, the gun is stupid accurate. Last week at the range, at 7 yards, I literally put 5 rounds through the same hole. As in, it looked like only 1 shot had been fired. Unfortunately I then promptly screwed up the \"group\" (if you could even call it that) with the last 3 rounds of the magazine, but that was my own fault, not the gun. \n\nIt's not very hard to shoot fist-sized groups at 15 yards, assuming I don't flinch and mess it up. I can shoot the gun as accurately as I shoot my Baer. I think it would perform comparably in a Ransom Rest. \n\nThe point being, I wouldn't worry at all about the slide to frame fit. They fit together properly, and the gun still oozes quality, despite the slide to frame not being tight. The important part is that the barrel is fit extremely well. Hard contact between the barrel feet and slide stop pin, and a surprisingly tight bushing for a Colt (as tight as my Baer). \n\nYou put a SCRG Commander on layaway, right?

Take the guide rod, recoil spring, and plug out of the slide, but leave in the barrel and bushing.

You should be able to shove the barrel as far as it will go into the slide lugs. Release pressure.

{"body":"Great review, thanks for posting! Definitely one for the wiki.\n\nOne correction, when talking about the trigger, you said it's DAO, but it's actually SAO (like all 1911s). Just a typo I think :)\n\nRegarding the construction of the gun, everything is forged or bar stock. The slide is forged steel, the frame is forged aluminum, and all other parts should be bar stock steel.\n\nI wouldn't recommend lowering the hammer manually. The gun is designed to be carried cocked and locked, which is the safest way to have a round in the chamber. Lowering the hammer has risk of it slipping and setting off the chambered round, and having the hammer down on a loaded chamber has risk of firing if the hammer gets hit hard (like if the gun is dropped). With the hammer back and thumb safety on, the sear is mechanically blocked from moving, and there is also the extra half cock notch on the hammer in the event that it somehow slips off the sear nose. You don't get either of those 2 safety features with the hammer forward.\n\nYou're right, the mags are in fact Checkmates. They make the OEM mags for a bunch of manufacturers (DW, Colt, Ruger, Sig, etc). They are nice mags.\n\nAny 1911 style magazines should work in the gun. The only thing you have to be careful about is over inserting the magazines if the baseplate on the mag doesn't sit flush with the bottom of the frame. For example, if you use full size 8 rounders, the baseplates will sit a half inch or so below the bottom of the frame when the mag is seated in the gun. If you do a reload with the slide locked back, the mag can jump past the mag catch and the feed lip will hit the bottom of the ejector, which could loosen or break it (especially if it happens repeatedly). So you can use bigger magazines, but you either need to be careful when you seat them (don't slam them into the gun, just let them click into place and stop shoving), or find some baseplates that extend up to the right spot for an Officer frame. I'm sure magazines like that exist, but I don't know of any specifically off the top of my head. I don't have much experience with Officers.\n\nThanks again for posting!","subreddit_id":"t5_3a0xc","subreddit":"1911fans"}

It is a very light recoil impulse, like /heekma said, I notice I automatically drive the pistol back down to get it on target quicker. One problem with 9mm is that I shoot way more of it in a single range session. I will blast through 300 rounds of 9mm, and go \"oh shit\" afterwards. \n\nAlso for all of those who say a owner of a 9mm 1911 deserves a special place in hell, remember Colt original intention of the Commander sized model was to shoot 9mm and compete with the Browning Hi Power.

Shot nicely right out of the box, grouped well with Hornady 185 XTP loads and his own Bayou Bullet 200 Semi Wadd Cutter loads. Trigger is crisp and clean, would give the Wilson the edge it has a smoother cleaner and lighter break. Moving on to the Colts shot more of my M45 today and keep shooting low left with it unless I aim the sights and little high. His Rail Gun did the same thing until he changed the Barrel to a Ed Brown one, maybe I'm using the three dots the wrong way. Shot his father's Willey Clap, he installed a Fusion Flat trigger, Wilson Strong Safety and a arched main spring housing. Pistol feels great in hand with the tapered grips, checkering. I can't group well with it, I don't like how wide the rear sight is but I love the brass bead front. Springfield shot great as usual, groups well and love the fiber optic front, may put a similar sight syste, on the Wilson. Also like /u/heekma says Kimber gets a bad rap for no reason. That Kimber has a great trigger, fit and finish is sweet and has checkering to boot. Damned fine 1911 is you ask me, has their external extractor but seems to eject them right out. We were shooting at 12 yards, we sometimes do 25 but didn't feel that daring today.

{"body":"See my posts on my Baer UTC, which recently passed the 20,000 round milestone. \n\nThe bluing on Baers is pretty nice. The flats of the gun will be more polished than most S80 Colts I have seen. The bluing is nothing to brag about, but it certainly doesn't look bad. It looks pretty good actually. \n\nBaer is a significant step up from a Dan Wesson. Everything, literally every part, is hand fit to the gun. Most of the parts actually have the gun's serial number, or part of it, hand engraved on them. From the DWs I have shot, the Baer triggers tend to be a lot better. The barrel fit will also be better all around (slide stop pin, bushing, slide lugs, hood). I think Baer tends to do a better job blending things, too, like the back of slide/frame, right side of mag release, contouring the thumb safety, beavertail, etc.\n\nThe Baer will be tighter if you get a carbon steel gun, which the vast majority of Baers are. It's actually a little hard to take one apart and put it back together until it smooths in a little. The gun may stick in battery a tad because of how tight the barrel feet are fit on the slide stop pin. You will need a bushing wrench. Every piece fits snug/tight, even seemingly random things like the trigger in the frame, mainspring housing in the frame, the barrel, the thumb safety starts out stiff, etc. \n\nThe whole \"build philosophy\" (for lack of a better term) of a Baer is to make the gun way too tight to start with, so that it will wear in to perfection and stay there for a long time. I personally think they do a really good job at that.","subreddit_id":"t5_3a0xc","subreddit":"1911fans"}

{"body":"That's relatively normal, and the important part isn't necessarily the play there, but more where the hole in the link is in relation to the barrel feet. For example, if the barrel link hole is oblong (which is common, my Baer is that way), you could have some play when you just have the slide stop through the link. But if the barrel feet are still able to actually make contact with the slide stop pin, then it's probably ok. On the other hand, if there is play because the inner edge of the hole in the link (inner in relation to the barrel feet) doesn't line up with the contour of the barrel feet, then yes, your link is too long. \n\nAnd it's not even as straightforward as that. The link is really only supposed to cam the barrel *down*, not back up. So if it's camming the barrel down correctly (aka the barrel isn't unlocking early), then the link is the correct length. In that case, the real underlying problem is that the barrel feet are too short, technically. You could either fit a new barrel, or oblong the hole in the link. Both accomplish the same thing, one is just way cheaper and therefore more common. \n\nThe point being, I have a feeling you will either need to swap in a shorter link, oblong the hole in your current link, or potentially even both (but probably not). But if you just swap in a shorter link, you may correct the camming-up problem, but cause a camming-down problem that wasn't previously there. ","subreddit_id":"t5_3a0xc","subreddit":"1911fans"}
{"body":"So I decided to suit up and enjoy a nice short IDPA match out at one of the clubs on Saturday. It was 92 degrees with 60% humidity. Luckily for us it was a short one.

The parts have visible file marks where they were fit together (not visible from the outside of the gun, you have to take it apart). There are machining marks inside the slide. Interior surfaces that don't functionally matter are left a little rough, compared to Ed Brown or Wilson Combat, who would polish them. \n\nAlmost everything is done with hand tools. The beavertails, for example, are blended by a guy with a Dremel. Pick up 2 Baers and the beavertails will look a tiny bit different, because there is some variation gun-to-gun. \n\nBaers are the ultimate form-follows-function 1911s. Things that don't affect performance are typically omitted. That, and the fact they are entirely hand built, doesn't really make them better or worse than other semi customs.

{"body":"Great review, even better gun!\n\nSo far I've owned several railed 1911s: A SigArms (Caspian framed) a pair of SA Operators, two of the original Colt Rail Guns and an M45.\n\nOut of all those the M45 was the most solid, heavy and light recoiling.  The extra weight of the frame and dual recoil springs noticeably damp recoil.  No, it doesn't feel like a 9mm, but shoot it side by side with a standard Government model and you'll feel the difference.  Not night and day, but you can easily tell which one recoils less. I can only imagine how much easier it would've been to shoot with a checkered front strap.\n\nThis is what I find most interesting...out of those guns, the Sig and SAs had rails of similar shape and thickness.  The original Colt Rail Guns had significantly heavier rails, yet under hard military testing even those stronger rails failed.\n\nThere has never been an issue with Colt's metallurgy, in fact their forged frames and slides are among the best money can buy. I can only assume that most of the railed 1911s offered by virtually all other makers, which are all similar in size and thinner than the original Colt Rail Guns, would likely fail as well.\n\nThis is why I hold the newest Colt Rail Guns in such high regard.  They have gone through real-world, unbiased testing and are significantly different and improved compared to all other offerings because of it.\n\nIf I were in the market for a railed 1911 or if someone were to ask my recommendation it would unreservedly be one of the new Colt Rail Guns.","subreddit_id":"t5_3a0xc","subreddit":"1911fans"}

{"body":"DWs have all forged or bar stock parts. Not tool steel, that's a different thing (used for sears and disconnectors, typically). Baers use some cast parts. So the DW definitely wins in parts quality, no argument there. \n\nThat said, Baer parts are still very good. The only cast part they use that, in my opinion, really shouldn't be cast is the slide stop. However, you don't hear about Baer slide stops (or any other parts, for that matter) breaking very often. \n\nThe mag release on a Baer is cast, as you said. That's a low stress part though, and I'm &gt;20,000 rounds on mine and it's still working fine...\n\nParts quality, while very important, also isn't everything. Where Baer absolutely excels is fitting of all the parts (especially the barrel). Literally every part on a Baer is hand fit by a gunsmith that knows what they're doing. The barrels especially are well fit (that's why the guns tend to be pretty tight), making for not only an accurate gun, but also a reliable gun that will stay accurate for 10s of thousands of rounds. With Baer, you're paying for a few dozen hours of time in the hands of skilled gunsmiths. \n\nOn the other hand, with DW, you're paying for a good production gun with very little hand fitting. And that's not necessarily a bad thing. Ed Browns have very little hand fitting, and they are fantastic. DWs also have had some QC issues lately, it seems. Which isn't the end of the world, and they stand by their products, but they don't get the same individual attention that a Baer gets. That's not to say Baers are free from flaws either, however, but the odds of getting a lemon are lower. \n\nAnd don't worry about being a little argumentative. This type of good informative discussion is exactly what this sub is for. A lot of people here have different opinions on one brand versus another, and that's totally cool. Our community has been really good so far at respectfully talking (sometimes disagreeing) about 1911s. There's obviously a lot of brand debate that goes on, but at the end of the day, the important thing in this sub is technical discussion and shooting, not really the rollmark on the gun.

For any other use-case, there are modern guns which are thoroughly superior. If it's not .45, it's not really a throwback IMO.\n\nI've shot 9mm 1911s extensively and they're wonderful. They can be reliable despite the common aversion to the configuration. It's just a bit like buying a '69 Camaro and then dropping a 2JZ or something into it. It's just... *wrong*.","subreddit_id":"t5_3a0xc","subreddit":"1911fans"}
{"body":"I don't want to come off argumentative, but why do you say that baer is a huge step up from dan wesson?  I just got my first baer, a premier ll, Thursday, haven't shot it yet. I thought I was seeing things on my mag release. Looked like a casting seam. I guess it was. I didn't think baer used anything but tool steel. As far as I know, DWs are all tool steel. So far the baer seems amazing, but not any better than my wessons, just different. I'm not trying to be difficult, just curious as I now have both makers. You seem to be quite knowledgeable and I'm just curious. \nAlso, in response to the other poster who asked about a railed 1911, check out the dan wesson specialist. A lot of great features, 25lpi, ball cuts, serrated top, ambi safeties, flush cut slide stop, mag well. I got mine, a stainless model, for 1445 at buds 2 months ago. It's great. \n","subreddit_id":"t5_3a0xc","subreddit":"1911fans"}
{"body":"The real benefit behind the double springs is the longevity, since recoil spring changing seems to be the biggest reliability problem with military handguns.  The Marine Corps specifies the springs to be replaced after 5000 rounds, while Colt has found them still in spec after over 8000 rounds.

{"body":"So I think I unintentionally posted the album to Imgur when I uploaded... which is apparently a thing (I thought that's what reddit was for? the internet is a weird place). We'll see how that goes...\n\nAnyways, 150 rounds for the Colt for a total of 4,050. 100 for the Mark 23 with the Octane 45 hangin off the end. The range emptied out near the end of the night, so I had my buddy shoot the Mark 23 suppressed 1 shot while I had no ear protection on. It was a lot louder than I expected, and more high pitched, but no ringing or pain in my ears, just kinda loud. To be fair, it's an indoor range with concrete floors, plywood walls, and metal ceiling, so that didn't help.\n\nSpeaking of my buddy, his Colt is FINALLY coming back from Evolution this week (Turnbull was really the hold up), but he still shot the Baer for tonight. 200 rounds for a total of 20,700. \n\nAnd *speaking of my buddy's Colt*, Evolution sent him some photos of it all done, and my God the Turnbull bluing looks fantastic. I can't wait to see it in person. It also looks like Evolution did a perfect job with the checkering and gold bead sight. My buddy is psyched, and I have to say I'm pretty excited to see it myself.\n\nGet out and shoot, those 1911s aren't going to get dirty on their own!","subreddit_id":"t5_3a0xc","subreddit":"1911fans"}

This smoking demon ship was filled with strange things like a train and telegraph equipment (which they would set up between two towns within the month). Japan at the time was very \"civilized\" culture but its familiar with new Western technologies was minimal. These foreign whites would have been the first whites ever seen here, they would do a number of strange things in the spirit of friendship like put on a stageshow in blackface and fire cannons \"in celebration\" of the emperor (pictured).\n\nWell that does it.

I doubt Obama could actually appear in a Marvel movie, so that'd rule out anything related to the presidency from appearing. It's also hard to anticipate the future if you go with real presidents. If AoS wants to have the president appear in Season 4, who would they need to hire? Trump or Clinton? The show is filmed closer to release than the movies, but it's impossible to wait until the results are in for filming the episodes if you want any late 2016.\n\nIn short, I think it's better to have a fictional president, but it was poorly handled in the MCU.

Class 3 Senators are being elected this year, Class 1 will come around in 2018, and Class 2 in 2020. \n\nIf the class schedule is the same here as in real life, then Ward is slightly more likely to be the Class 1 senator than Class 2. That said, if the previous Class 1 or 2 Senator had died or resigned and Ward had been *appointed,* he could have a same-year election to keep the post. Special elections are complicated, and I don't know how Massachussetts in particular handled them. \n\nThe MCU could also be a universe where Mass has Class 3 Senators, in which case Ward could have been up for general election November 2016. \n\nThere are always Senatorial elections at the same time as presidential elections, but the pattern of correspondence between presidential races and Senatorial classes is too complicated to be useful here. \n\nTLDR: Is there any way to determine the years of the presidential election using this information?

It states that he was elected after the New York Battle in 2012 (which was the moment that Obama got re-elected), but I'm taking this paragraph with a grain of salt. It's an assumption based on a quote, as far as I know. It would make sense to have the MCU presidency to run simultaneous to our world's presidency, but that would mean there's elections going on in the MCU right now as well. Perhaps AoS will address this early on in Season 4? This would also mean that we'd definitely need a new president in 2020, after Infinity War has ended.

Some of the older girls go shopping for babyproof stuff and gifts for their friend\u2019s kids. It\u2019s by far the most boring part of the show. They try to create drama by rushing to baby proof the cabinet corners before they babysit their friend\u2019s kids.\n One of the kids, Noel, is adopted, and Jessa talks about how much she wants to adopt again. I\u2019m not really understanding why this family dresses their black adopted child in traditional African outfits while their white child wears nothing of the sort. \n This time they say they want to do a domestic adoption, but they have to wait until Sprug is 9 months. Now they have to wait longer. As a side note, they actually own a lot of books which is promising.\n\n**Dillards**\n\nDereck surprises everyone with progressively worse hair. As always, they complain about how horrible Central America is and how heroic they are for being there. No mention of Zika, but they do talk about how the water goes out a lot. They mention that they going to return home soon-is this normal for missionaries? I kind of thought they would stay there for years. They spent most of their time learning the language.\n\n**Anna**\n\nJosh is back! Not on screen yet though. She hangs out with Jessa and Jinger in this episode and does nothing interesting. Every day, she looks more and more like a Duggar sister. \n\n**Jeremy and Jinger**\n\nJIN JIN is in WUV! There is not a whole lot of it in this episode though, just foreshadowing. They have to fill up a whole season remember? Jeremy and Jim Bob meet up in the airport and they go out for coffee. Jeremy seems like a catch. He used to play professional soccer, but now is a minister. Jim Bob makes a ton of embarrassing dad comments. Jeremy asks Jim Bob to court Jinger. They shake hands like it\u2019s a business deal. At least it wasn\u2019t as embarrassing as Derricks closet encounter. \nHe brings Jinger a coffee cup of flowers then tells her about the arrangement he made with her father. Jinger says yes. Jeremy says he loves her. They haven\u2019t even gone on a date yet. For people that never show up on time, they sure move fast. \n\n**Duggar Boys**\n\nOne of the boys (I can\u2019t tell them apart) is getting is a commercial drivers license. At least some of them are employable. JD claims he is not all interested in romance. I\u2019m not sure what to make of that.

Dubstep, drum &amp; bass, trance... I think those were the different styles but I'm not really sure the differences in EDM, I just know there was a very distinct difference in all 3 and each was amazing for its own reasons. This was in New Orleans after a Tool show so people were passing around joints like it was nothing and I was gone but I had an amazing time until we left at like 7am. I can usually take a hit and be pretty sociable but at this dose I had no desire to communicate and only wanted to trip out on the music and the visuals I was getting.

On top of the above, a strong dose of LSD-25 also leaves you with depleted seratonin and dopamine levels the next day, not to mention simply physically tired.  I can't speak to the purity of what I've had unfortunately - I've only encountered AL-LAD in its crystal form, all the LSD I've had has been in liquid or on paper, so anything the people giving it to me claimed about it is obviously suspect beyond its definitely having been LSD - but the points I've made above don't require me to do so as they're not anecdotal or opinions derived from my own experiences.","subreddit_id":"t5_3a2i8","subreddit":"1P_LSD"}
