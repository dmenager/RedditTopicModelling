{"body":"I had a rather crappy experience today, but one which provided motivation eventually.  I decided to finally take progress pics even though I'm more than a month into this.  But I decided it was better late than never.  So I did the full body pics and they were fine.  I was able to see that I was definitely smaller than I was a month ago.  Then I decided to take face pics.  Bad idea.  I haven't really seen a close up pic of my face in a couple of years (I've avoided cameras like the plague).  I looked *so old* and *soooooo saggy* because the fat is starting to leave my face.  But also soooo fat.  Not enough fat has left my face, so it's that weird in between stage.\n\nI brooded about it all day.  I actually broke down crying at one point.  I realized that many of us will hit this point in our journey.  It is the point where our weight loss effort starts to change the way we see ourselves.  That change can be shocking.  We may not recognize ourselves at all, and we have to redefine ourselves... to ourselves. \n\nPrior to my decision to do keto, I had considered bariatric surgery.  I read that it is a very difficult journey emotionally.  But so is any major weight loss, no matter how it happens, for all the reasons stated above.\n\nI realized that this is the moment when many people would quit.  Decide to keep the old, familiar, fat, non-saggy face, because that scary new sagging-skinned woman staring back in the picture looks like a stranger.  Familiarity is so comforting that it can kill us sometimes.  But not me, not this time.  I am going to stick with this.  This is my motivation this week!\n\nTL;DR - motivation came from a very unflattering pic of my strange, new deflating face","subreddit_id":"t5_34au7","subreddit":"100DaysofKeto"}

Last concert we did was Rock on the Range in Ohio, and I was the only one keto for that trip.  The only thing that was frustrating was the lack of satisfying meals.  I would fast while at the venue, (except the last day, where I had a turkey leg... OMG yum) and outside of the venue.. we did a lot of fast food.  I stayed keto, but food was very unsatisfying (paper thin burger patties, just don't cut it)  I'm hoping that this time, I have better luck with food wherever we eat.

I was so despondent wanted to die, but if I didn't change my lifestyle, I realized, I surely would die, and very soon.  \n\nSo here I am, fully committed to my health for the first time in many years and feeling so much better - both physically and mentally.  Having an incentive to lose weight other than my appearance has finally made this lifelong goal achievable.","subreddit_id":"t5_34au7","subreddit":"100DaysofKeto"}
{"body":"I finished my third 120 hour fast in four weeks. I actually finished at the 117 hour mark with a coconut oil and butter coffee because I thought I wouldn't be able to finish the fast until the 123rd hour, something I did on my first \"120\" hour fast. As it turned out I would have been able to break at the 121 hour point but hey, the last four weeks have been 123 hours - 120 hours - break week - 117 hours. So on average 120 hours fasts. Maths fun.\n\nI'll be starting the last of my planned four weeks of 120 hour fasts on Sunday. The break week was unplanned. I intended to do four 120 hour fasts in four weeks but due to how I was feeling in the second week I played it safe and made the third week a maintenance week. So it's four 120 hour fasts in five weeks.\n\nMy plan going forward *was* to do a 120 hour fast for the second week of every quarter while doing mostly maintenance or calorie cutting  as required for weight loss for the other 12 weeks of the quarter. But after my experience with fasting I'm strongly considering ADF (Alternate Day Fasting) until I reach my goal weight and then 5:2 fasting (5 days maintenance plus a little, 2 days fasting) as a maintenance plan. Full keto regardless of the option I pick of course.\n\nThe first two days of fasting have just been so damn easy and even after 5 days of fasting with an allowed limit well above my maintenance I haven't splurged on the in between days. Days three and four of the fasting were rougher. So any plan involving 1-2 days of fasting seems very practical.\n\nAnyway. I start the last of the 120 hour fasts in ~38 hours. I'm sure I'll have made a choice by this time next week.","subreddit_id":"t5_34au7","subreddit":"100DaysofKeto"}

I had tons of temptation because I made an elaborate cake for my daughter, so I ended up eating a bunch of sugar. It took me a few days to recover from that. Obsessive thoughts about sugar, sneaking a few bites of random carbs here and there, feeling uber sick, feeling downright depressed. Not guilty--I don't get down on myself like that. But like on Tuesday morning I was literally crying from sadness, and I'm pretty sure it was because the carbs and/or the wheat threw my system out of whack. \n\nI remembered that bacon never fails me, it is my defense mechanism, so I got a pound of bacon and ate that for breakfast, and I've been okay since. Feeling nauseated quite a bit, but otherwise things have started to stabilize. My zero carb food tastes delicious again, and I'm back to not craving sugar, and only being hungry twice a day. \n\nAlso, ironically, eating the sugar was probably good for my weight loss. Because I felt sick on those days, I had my single zero carb meal, and a slice of cake, making my total calories much lower than normal. So now, after the water weight has gone away, I'm down a few pounds. Still, I don't want to repeat it :-p And, there are no special events for months where it would mean a lot to have me bake, so no big temptations.

I never had fluctuations, I was either lower or the same weight every day, even for shark week. This time, I fluctuate like crazy, and the loss is so slow. So I did some research....\n\n\nWhat I found is that losing weight the second time is harder, possibly due to hormones. Plus since I gave birth 5 months ago, I have those added hormones (like seriously, I cry at almost every movie now. WTF?!?). So anyone experiencing this same frustration, this is apparently a thing. To add to that, at my heaviest (276) I wore a size 20/22. Now I comfortably fit into an 18-except at Old Navy because holy crap the vanity sizing there has gotten even worse! I tried on size 18, 16, and 14 skinny jeans the other day. The size 14 fit the best in the waist, but the legs were too big. It is so weird how much pregnancy changed the shape of my body. Last time when I weighed this, I wore a size 14, no if ands or buts. But now, I can't even get a true 16 over my ass...\n\n\nI guess I am not doing a good job of this, haha. I just want anyone in my situation to know it is not just you. Yes it is harder now. And yes it is frustrating. But it will happen. It just might take a longer amount of time, but honestly what is the difference? If you don't lose it as fast, were you just going to stop? NO! So just keep doing what we're doing, and we will get there eventually. It's a marathon not a race \ufffd\ufffd","subreddit_id":"t5_34au7","subreddit":"100DaysofKeto"}

The rules for an egg fast vary pretty wildly but the general gist is 6+ eggs per day with butter and/or cheese and don't eat 3 hours before bed. Pretty simple. Why am I doing it? Like the previous fasts it's mostly curiosity and, well, boredom with a regular calorie restricted diet.\n\nSo that started this morning. I weighed in at 69.3kg at 6am. I've had two bulletproof coffees (butter + coconut oil) and a bit of fried cheese and two eggs. Looking at the likely calorie end points for various combinations of egg/cheese/butter that the diet recommends you'd probably end up in the 600-1000 Cal per day range with 0g carbs so it's no surprise people lose weight on this thing. I may gorge on eggs though and sweep way the hell past those calorie numbers.","subreddit_id":"t5_34au7","subreddit":"100DaysofKeto"}

I did three successful 120 hour fasts and decided at the last minute (actually, past the last minute) that I'd do another one starting last Sunday the 11th. It didn't go well I think primarily because it was a last minute decision.\n\nI haven't had serious rebound issues with weight or diet after the fasts. As you can see [here](http://i.imgur.com/yatdg0N.jpg) I've continued to lose weight on average even on the weeks I had a 2,000+ Cal plus refeed week. I attribute this to my keto diet - you can't regain the glycogen and associated water weight when you remain keto. And of course my TDEE is ~2150-2400 most weeks so I should be at worst stable on refeed weeks.\n\nSince [then](https://www.reddit.com/r/100DaysofKeto/comments/52biv1/sep_12_round_7_day_029_motivational_monday/d7j6p83) I haven't put too much thought into what I'll do this week.\n\nThe idea of alternate day fasting (eat nothing every other day) and 5:2 (one 2 day fast per week) appeal to me. With ADF I'd probably do Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday every week instead of a continuous off-on cycle. With 5:2 I'd probably fast on Sunday &amp; Monday.\n\nI think I'll leave it another week though. Try and get back in the habit of a ~1600 Cal diet which was the vague plan for this week, but I ended up well above that. My enemy there has been my old nemeses - protein bars and nuts. They're my weakness when at the shops and once I've bought them I scoff them down same day, usually. If I'd skipped them my average for this week would be 1865 Cal instead of 2248 Cal... and that's only direct calories, I think eating them makes me hungry instead of sating hunger.","subreddit_id":"t5_34au7","subreddit":"100DaysofKeto"}

{"body":"Are you sore from the exercise? You might be retaining water, or going through the fat-muscle transformation.

On top of this you'll lose the 5-10 lbs of water, so you might see it as this:\n\n&gt;Week 1: 5 lbs (-4 water, -1 fat)\n\n&gt;Week 2: 3 lbs (-2 water, -1 fat)\n\n&gt;Week 3: 2 lbs (-1 water, -1 fat)\n\n&gt;Week 4: 1 lbs ( 0 water, -1 fat)\n\n&gt;Week 5: 0 lbs (+1 water, -1 fat)\n\n&gt;Week 6: 0 lbs (+1 water, -1 fat)\n\n&gt;Week 7: 0 lbs (+1 water, -1 fat)\n\n&gt;Week 8: 0 lbs (+1 water, -1 fat)\n\n&gt;Week 9: 0 lbs (+1 water, -1 fat)\n\n&gt;Week 10: 0 lbs (+1 water, -1 fat)\n\n&gt;Week 11: 1 lbs ( 0 water, -1 fat)\n\n&gt;...\n&gt;So you lose \"weight\" the first weeks as you lose both water and fat, and then at the fifth week you stall as you start gaining back the 6 lbs if water. If you gain back 1 lb of water weight per week you'll have six weeks of stalling before you start losing 1 lb per week again, and by that point you've actually lost those 10 lbs in real fat (four weeks of weight loss, six weeks of stalling, but actually losing 1 lbs of fat per week).

I'm pretty new to these long fasts - the last four weeks being my only real experience. Before that I've only done lazy IF (ie I don't snack and I usually skip breakfast and sometimes lunch).\n\nI drink black coffee, tea, 5g of psyllium husk powder, a multivitamin, electrolyte pills and bone broth. And I've just added diluted Apple Cider Vinegar and this week I was lazy and didn't make bone broth so I'm using stock cubes. The calories for the day end up being 40-80, mostly from the broth/stock and apple cider vinegar. [Sample](http://i.imgur.com/vtgDZUo.jpg). [Sample 2](http://i.imgur.com/43VrkVV.jpg).\n\nI didn't work out for the first two weeks of fasting but did during the week break and am this week. I've only done one workout when I was just 30ish hours fasted but will be doing the second in about 8 hours at the ~80 hour mark. But I'm a good 20-35kg on each lift away from where fails would be possible/likely so it's not a massive test or anything.\n\nI have gotten headaches but the mildest of mild headaches that I feel like a bit of a wuss for even mentioning. A couple of paracetamols and a salty drink and it's gone in under an hour. I tend to get them around the 72-90 hour mark - I've got one while typing this and expect it to be gone soon. It's like a 1/10 on [the pain scale](http://i.imgur.com/dacqHJ5.jpg). It's worth noting I don't really get keto flu, even back before I knew to supplement K/Mg/Na.

{"body":"\n\"With acknowledgements to Lady Butler's picture.\"\n\n\"Elizabeth Thompson, Lady Butler, was one of the most popular and well-known artists in late Victorian Britain. In 1874 she had submitted a painting entitled \u2018The Roll Call\u2019 to the Royal Academy in London which caused a sensation and crowds flocked to see it. Butler had taken a completely new approach to military paintings, showing the pain and suffering of ordinary soldiers.  Staniforth uses this painting as the basis for his cartoon in which the roll call is one of Zeppelins as opposed to soldiers.  On 2-3 September 1916 the biggest Zeppelin raid to date occurred, with twelve German Navy and four Army airships setting out to bomb London. Bad weather over the North Sea scattered the airships and only one managed to come within seven miles of central London, the others being forced back to their bases. The airship SL11 dropped eleven bombs in Hertfordshire before it was brought down by Lieutenant William Leefe Robinson who was awarded the Victoria Cross for his achievement.  In Staniforth\u2019s cartoon the Kaiser is checking in his remaining battered Zeppelins after the raid, with a discarded bomb on the floor.\"","subreddit_id":"t5_2y3jq","subreddit":"100yearsago"}

(It should be noted that the Hunding Line was later subdivided into two lines renamed the Brunhild Line and Kriemhild Line).\n\nThe new German defensive system is the greatest construction project of the war, with 370,000 workers (German reservists, civilians, and Russian POWs) involved in the construction work and another 170,000 allocated to preparing the necessary building materials. Some 1,250 supply trains transport building materials to the front. To the great anger of the French, the Germans as they withdraw create a desert by destroying orchards, towns, and roads between their old and new fronts. \n","subreddit_id":"t5_2y3jq","subreddit":"100yearsago"}

On 10 September the paper had titled its editorial \u2018The Enemy Under the Hammer\u2019 and made reference to \u2018splendid gains\u2019 on the Somme. \u2018Over a front of thirty miles heavy fighting has been continually in progress, and everywhere the enemy has had to yield ground before the arms of the Allies. Over and over again the red tide of battle surged over Guillemont. For long it resisted the valour of our gallant troops. But in the long run they were not to be denied, and all the arch-devilry of German defence could not further maintain the place against the dogged spirit of our matchless British infantry. Thiepval, too, is seriously threatened, and with its certain fall a pillar which supports a large section of the German fron to the north collapses. With that collapse the British will be free, if it is so desired, to sweep onwards over a new and widely-extended front.\u2019 On 17 September 1916 the editorial was titled \u2018Girdle of iron closing on enemy\u2019: \u2018Well may the nation read to-day with pride and delight the great and glorious news of the new victorious advance of our army on the Somme. Our troops have smashed into the old German third line \u2026 we are isolating the obstinate stronghold of Thiepval.\u2019 And in this week\u2019s editorial it was argued that \u2018while with sure and methodical blows the Anglo-French offensive moves from one brilliant success to another\u2019 \u2026 \u2018It would be unfair to our splendid soldiers to suggest that the Germans are not, in the main, fighting well. What is true is that they are not fighting well enough to stand before British troops.\u2019","subreddit_id":"t5_2y3jq","subreddit":"100yearsago"}

Unknown to the Germans, the machine guns of British airplanes now have incendiary ammunition that can torch the hydrogen that fills the Zeppelins. One of the army Zeppelins falls victim to this ammunition, crashing in flames and killing its sixteen crew members. The massive raid fails. \n\n//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\n* September 2\u20133 (overnight) \u2013 12 German Navy and four German Army airships raid southeast England in the largest airship raid of World War I; they drop 823 bombs totaling 38,979 pounds (17,681 kg), killing four people and injuring 12 and causing over \u00a321,000 in damage. Royal Flying Corps Lieutenant William Leefe-Robinson, flying a B.E.2c, shoots down the German Army Sch\u00fctte-Lanz airship *SL 11*, which falls spectacularly in flames near London, killing her entire crew of 16. Leefe-Robinson becomes the second pilot to shoot down an airship and the first to do it over the United Kingdom, and the German Army Airship Service withdraws from future bombing raids on England, leaving the bombing campaign to German naval airships.

{"body":"\n**Somme River**. The British attack begins at 6:20 a.m. on a wide front stretching from Bouleaux Wood to Mouquet Farm. The troops advance behind a creeping barrage. They are meant to be supported by forty-nine tanks- their first appearance in battle- but only eighteen of these actually participate, as fifteen have failed to find their assembly sites and others bog down in the great shell craters of no-man's-land. In a few cases, the tanks fire on their own infantry because of the confusion of battle and difficulties in maneuvering. German shells destroy some of the strange new weapons. But where the tanks succeed in their role, astounded German troops give way or surrender in large groups. Improved communications and aerial reconnaissance also help the British effort. They capture Courcelette, push near the Mouquet Farm, secure Martinpuich, and take High Wood and Flers; they are stopped, however, at Bouleaux Wood and the nearby Quadrilateral.\n\n//////////////////////////////////////////////\n\n* September 15\u201322. \tBattle of Flers-Courcelette; the British use armored tanks for the first time in history.\n\n////////////////////////////////////////\n\n* Paris, 15 September.

It is clear, however, that he had no idea what the tanks really looked like. The tanks, or land ships as they were officially known, had set off from a point a little outside Pozieres on the Somme front and although only nine managed to reach the German lines they managed to break through. The tanks struck fear in to the Germans since they were immune to the light arms fire from their trenches giving the infantryman little choice but to give ground.

The cautious advance of the Romanian forces, hampered by poor mountain roads and blown bridges, allows Falkenhayn to assemble his forces on the Maros River for a counterfoffensive. Mackensen's pressure on the Bulgarian front forces the Romanian high command to shift troops to that front. \n\n**WESTERN FRONT:** On the Somme, rain that had started on the previous evening reduces the battlefield to a quagmire. The day before Rawlinson had issued grandiose orders that called for a general attack on September 16, to be \"pushed home with the utmost vigour\" so as \"to enable the Cavalry Corps to push through to its objectives and complete the enemy's defeat\". A few attacks do take place today, but the continuation of a general offensive proves impossible. Continued bad weather and opposition from the French to an immediate resumption of a general offensive will further delay any general Anglo-French attack until September 25.\n\n**STRATEGY:** When the India Office lobbies for a British advance up the Tigris to capture Baghdad, Sir William Robertson, the government's adviser on strategy, dissents. \"We have not got\", he notes in a paper for the War Committee, \"and are not likely to have, available the number of troops required to seize and hold Baghdad; for a long time to come we cannot hope to maintain them there even if we had them; their position at Baghdad would be in a military sense unfavourable and would exert no decisive effect on the war\". In private letters to Maude, the new British commander in Mesopotamia, Robertson also cautions him against enlarging the British commitment in that part of the world. \n","subreddit_id":"t5_2y3jq","subreddit":"100yearsago"}

For new guns they only had a bolt action .22 Rugers and the salesman was also trying to pitch getting a .17 instead. We accepted defeat but he offered to take us to their \"Gun Corner\" where they had all sorts of things. While he wen to the backroom we saw things like a cira 1912 Colt SAA, a WWII era BAR, even some beautifully kept lever actions from the late 1800's!

{"body":"Okay, so here's the quick 'n dirty how to use peep sights.\n\nFirst, sight alignment. Put your cheek on the stock, look through the rear sight. Look **AT** the front sight. It should be in perfect focus. Your target WILL be blurry. This is good. You should always be focused on the right sight.\n\nAgain, your eyeball physically can focus on only one thing out of the three that you're aligning (Rear sight, front sight, target). So focus on the front sight. This is critical. \n\nYou should also *try* to keep the front sight as close to the center of the blurry circle that is the rear sight as you can (this is not a *critical* thing to do with peep sights, but it does help). Due to the optical design of the peep sights, you can be off-center with this and still get good hits, but it'll improve accuracy a bit to keep it centered.\n\n\nNext: Sight picture. Put the center of the front post in the center of the target. Imagine that there's a vertical line in the middle of your front post, and a horizontal line across the top of it. [This is your 'crosshair'](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-skn6zVvfd8k/T0OTqCycoAI/AAAAAAAAAGk/Tr00b4LTmec/s547/sightAlignment.gif). It'll look [like this](https://www.ocabj.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/sight_picture-center.gif) when done properly.\n\nHere's an example of what you can expect to see, on a 10/22 with the OEM peeps: http://imgur.com/cEcmgv9\n\nHere's an example showing that the target and rear sight won't be focused: http://i.imgur.com/J5bNmir.jpg\n\n(hat tip to /r/aimdownsights)\n\n(There's another school of thought, called \"Pumpkin on a post\" or \"6-o-clock hold\". That's for weird people. We're not weird. Hold to the center of your target). \n\nSo after all that, if it's still shooting high, then adjust your sight. **The rear sight screws in and out to adjust elevation**. You should be able to zero your rifle at 25 yards no problem (Screw it down to move your impact down, screw it up to move your impact up). \n\nCleaning it is personal preference. I clean mine after every other shooting day. Some people wait thousands of rounds before cleaning. That bulk bucket ammo is dirty, so I'd clean more often than not.

You'll have a fun time, it'll be a success. Don't feel like you *need* to change anything.\n\nHowever, if I were you, I would spend the money for something other than the ruger factory peeps on the wood gun (also, it looks like the [oem ruger stock](http://www.ruger.com/products/1022Carbine/specSheets/21102.html)). They're very in-accurate to adjust (you won't be able to dial clicks for adjustment or anything like that), and they're also difficult to adjust as they have that stupid 2-set-screw setup for windage (that you have to completely fuck up to set elevation). \n\nThey'll work, but man they're bad.\n\nOn the takedown: I too have seen a guy who had great groups, they just kept shifting around on him all day. He was definitely rifleman-capable, but his rifle kept putting the (nice, tight) groups in the wrong location. It was a takedown, and I haven't seen the same problem with regular 10/22's. \n\nAlso, those don't look like [tech sights](http://www.tech-sights.com/ruger-products/) to me.

Take the takedown as a backup rifle with the OEM ruger peeps (or throw a scope on it if you've got one). It's 4 screws on each rifle to swap the rails on 'em, and then just push out the fronts.

I shot 50 rounds of Sig 180 grain ammo through it.  The box said it was 1250 fps.  After 50 rounds I got a lot of brass marks on my slide.  It also scuffed up the heads on 50% of the brass and they are visibly rough as well as rough to the touch.  It spits the brass around 25' away and to 5:00.  It is my understanding that 10mm spits brass far anyway, but my slide is coming back too fast because of the stronger loads and that is what is causing the cases to hit the slide when they eject.\n\nI plan on reloading for it and I'm pretty disgusted with it beating up my brass.  I don't like it marking up my gun, but I also got the gun to use it and not to keep it scratch free, meaning if I have to run it this way I guess I'll live with the marking on the slide.

As much as I love the 1911, I shoot a Glock just as well and I have not yet had a stoppage in either Glock.  Both have over 1K rounds through them.  The Glock 20 get daily duty now.\n\nGoing UP to a Glock 29 from a 9mm may be a different experience though.  I went from a huge tank (Witness) to a slightly smaller tank(1911), to a lightweight, big gun (Glock 20).  If I had started with my Browning Hi Power, I might never have gone \"up\".","subreddit_id":"t5_2uf65","subreddit":"10mm"}

{"body":"In the world of full-auto submachine guns, 10mm has a leap in power and flatter-shooting distance than the usual popular pistol calibers. It would EXCEL in a short barrel where taking 100-200 yard shots can be difficult with those compact, low-recoil pistol-round rifles. It is a devastating round at close range. Having 30ish rounds on tap is just the plum in your pudding.. I fail to see how silly it compares to having, say, 30 rounds of .45 ACP. 10mm is more expensive, but not that expensive.\n\nFrankly, the only downside I see is increased noise/concussion, BUT you could also easily load heavy subsonic rounds and suppress if the mission called for it, and slap in your mag of hots if you need to take a distance shot where .45 wouldn't perform.\n\nI will readily admit the above isn't the best civilian rifle, and I would avoid it for home defense, again because of noise, and outside there are so many other options. Given the cartridge, I'd rather pack a lightweight 10mm guide gun, like a [repeater](http://www.rangerpointprecision.com/single-post/2015/05/09/Marlin-1894-Pistol-Caliber-Carbine-Conversions-10MM-40SW-45ACP-357SIG).

{"body":"So, the recoil spring does add resistance to rearward slide movement, but the stronger you make it, the stronger and faster the RETURN movement becomes, which can speed up wear and tear, and even damage your gun.\n  \nThe mainspring is inside the mainspring housing in the bottom-rear of the grip. Most resistance to rearward slide movement is caused by this spring. The slide pushes on the hammer, the hammer strut depresses this spring, and when you pull the trigger this is the spring that actuates the hammer to fire the round.\n  \nIf you increase the weight of the mainspring, you can increase the time it takes for the slide to unlock and move to the rear, which will help mitigate muzzle flip and recoil. Increasing the weight of this spring gives you the benefits of increasing the weight of the recoil spring, with none of the downsides, like increased slide velocity.\n  \nAs far as the firing pin stop. So, when the gun was originally designed there was a very small radius on the bottom of the firing pin stop. This decreased the mechanical advantage for the slide over cocking the hammer. The gun could run lighter springs while still being timed right. Well when the military adopted the gun as the M1911, one of the early \"problems\" they had were soldiers expressing difficulty racking the slide. They discovered that if they increased the radius on the firing pin stop, it would increase the mechanical advantage the slide had over cocking the hammer, making it easier to rack the gun. With this change came increased slide velocity and more recoil/muzzle flip. This has become effectively the \"standard\" for 1911's to this day (with some rare exceptions. My STI Nitro 10, for example, has a much smaller radius than other 10mm 1911's I've looked at).\n  \nEGW makes a replacement firing pin stop that has a true flat bottom. You need to fit it to your gun (it's very simple) and add a SMALL radius to the bottom outside edge of it where it contacts the hammer. They're not that expensive. The nice thing about this \"mod\" is that it's 100% reversible. You can bring your original and the new fitted one to the range and try shooting with both of them and see if you notice a difference in the shooting.\n  \nIf you want to go the firing pin stop route, there's been a ton written up online about them. Just do some google searches like \"flat firing pin stop recoil\" or \"fitting egw flat firing pin stop\".","subreddit_id":"t5_2uf65","subreddit":"10mm"}

If Jake had gone back in time and made a decent sum through gambling or the stock market (which would have been much safer, as Jake points out in the novel at one point), he could have bought a bunch of gold bars, buried them somewhere, then dug them up back in 2016 and made about a 450% profit on money he essentially cheated his way into in the first place.","subreddit_id":"t5_3arpq","subreddit":"112263Hulu"}

{"body":"Gotta admit, as a huge fan of the show, the part with the Kennedys calling Jake was one of the weaker scenes in the series from my perspective. Not due to the presentation (which was spot-on), but because it's clear that they inserted it only because it's in the book without considering the changes they made to the show that render it nonsensical. In the book, [spoiler](#s \"Jake is never a serious suspect after the shooting. The authorities suspect he isn't who he says he is, but they never really think he was involved in the shooting either and they come to believe that he stopped it pretty early on. Therefore, it makes perfect sense for Kennedy and his wife to call and thank him.\") In the show, he was considered to be a co-conspirator in the shooting up until literally seconds before the call came in. Why would the Kennedys make that call to someone who is being actively suspected of involvement in the assassination? Did they somehow find out in the space of seconds that Jake was innocent? It just plain doesn't make any sense. If they'd had the Kennedys call later on, in his hotel room or something, it would have made a whole lot more sense, since it'd give them some time to be informed that \"hey, the guy who got arrested wasn't involved and actually saved you guys\". As it stands, the scene just came off as sloppy to me. Like they remembered at the very last second that they needed to put that scene in and inserted it regardless of how much sense it made.  \n  \nSorry, I'm not trying to rain on your parade or anything, but that's been bothering me since my very first viewing of the series and I've never really had an opportunity to bring it up anywhere until now. I totally agree about the scene at the end with Sadie and Jake dancing, that was an incredible end to the series and I have no complaints about that bit.","subreddit_id":"t5_3arpq","subreddit":"112263Hulu"}

If you are in some way an exception, then perhaps consider that most comments about general things thus don't apply to you.

If a condition is medical and not psychological, then there should be no need for such falsified fanfare.

If you can't sleep you must be stressed or guilty or bipolar or something. However, in the majority of cases insomnia has a physiological cause, usually the person's body is having trouble regulating internal tempurature (you have to be slightly cold to fall asleep, dropping body temp is a part of the process of falling asleep and insomnia is prevelant in the summer). Insomnia can certainly be caused my a manic episode, but it is a lot more common for people to have episodic insomnia for less serious reasons like \"the bed is too hot in August.\"\n\nI don't have insomnia but I do have excessive hunger, and so far as my doctor and I can tell it is likely caused by my PCOS. I have managed to maintain a healthy weight my entire life, but I am constantly hungry when I simply shouldn't be. Having a big appetite could be caused by some deep internal trauma, or it could be stress or genetics or whatever else. In my case, my appetite has been nearly lifelong, it has persisted since puberty (around the same time I was first hospitalized for PCOS). If someone has no other symptoms of an eating disorder besides needing to eat a high volume of healthy food to feel satisfied it seems alarmist to diagnose them with a mental illness.","subreddit_id":"t5_3ermb","subreddit":"1200isjerky"}

If I can give myself the satisfaction of eating for as long as I did with a binge for less calories, it helps.\n\n2) Lots of water and using that water as a tool for my thought process.  Am I hungry or just sad/stressed?  I need to drink this 500 ml bottle of water.  If my tummy rumbles after, I can have a snack.  (Just as an example) Sometimes that snack can lead to another snack and another snack.  Read labels.  Look up the nutritional impact of what you're doing and ask yourself if its really worth sabotaging your hard work.\n\n3) Acknowledge that it's a mental battle.  Trying to change the behaviour drastically and all at once might not help.  Maybe introduce yourself to lower calorie high volume foods and start there.  Learn to know what satiation feels like.  Learn that food is fuel, not comfort.\n\n4) Find new activities that bring you joy.  Go for a walk, go shopping, do something that keeps your hands busy like colouring.  For me it was shopping at first, and now its the gym.\n\n5) LOG EVERYTHING.  Item by item.  It's so tedious and annoying if you've been picking at different things all day that it might prompt you to stop.  Even if it's one giant costco bag of chips, log it all.  You need to see the caloric evidence and think about how much more fuel you gave your body than you needed that day.  \n\nHope this helps, and good luck!

{"body":"This will not be relevant for everyone \u2013 maybe not to OP \u2013 but in case this is useful to someone: for me the trick is finding the absolute best-quality version of the thing I crave and rejecting all lesser versions. I'm in a financial bracket that means I think pretty carefully about every small purchase, and when I buy things that are more expensive than I feel I have a \"right\" to, I reflexively really slow down and savor them. I have had a lot of gross dollar-store and food-bank binges in my life, where it's like, oh, this huge sack of generic sugar cereal? It's garbage, it doesn't matter what happens to it, nobody wants this, I'm just going to shovel it down my craw. The more cheap and disposable it feels, the more likely I am to abuse it as a substance rather than relate to it as food in any rational way. But then if I spend like $5 on one bar of chocolate, as much as I feel ridiculous and guilty, I also eat it a tiny bit at a time over a much longer period and get a lot more pleasure out of it in the end, and I don't buy junk chocolate because I can say to myself \"Why would you, when you have something nicer at home?\" tl;dr \u2013 maximize quality and then quantity goes down of its own accord, I find.","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

After I make them, I wrap them in foil and stick them in the freezer. It's really easy and you just pop them in the microwave for lunch or dinner.  \n\nAlso, fast food places are not the worst. I personally love McDonald's Southwest chicken salad (grilled chicken) and will grab that if I don't feel like cooking. It's 450 calories including the dressing and really filling.  \n\nI also go to Chipotle to grab a burrito bowl with sofritas (definitely try it if you haven't, it's so good and I am not a vegetarian), brown rice, no beans, and EVERY other topping which total to a little under 1,000 calories.

{"body":"There isn't really strong evidence either way it looks like, upon doing more research - it's not well studied. For instance, the research cited in that article is with a fairly small sample set of people (under 3000 for #1 and *one person* for #2). Reference #1 study even states in the synopsis \"a greater drop in resting EE relative to weight loss was observed for short interventions (more than 2 but less than 6 weeks) when compared with long interventions (&lt;6 weeks)\" - i.e. short term drops in metabolism are noted but long-term it evens itself out. \n\nI've read anecdotal things from trainers (and seen people I know) whose weight loss plateaued or stopped until they increased their calories, because they either made dramatic cuts or cut continuously to a level that was far too little for their body size/activity rate. Obviously long-term keeping at a low rate would make them lose, but are they losing fat or cannibalizing muscle at that point if their body doesn't have enough fuel?\n\nEither way, the amount she is eating is not healthy for an adult unless they are a tiny, tiny person whether you believe metabolism drops are a \"myth\" or not. \n\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

{"body":"I'm a total binge eater.  I started losing in January and haven't had a ridiculously excessive binge since this week.  The way I got through it was too indulge a little bit.  Sure, I may go over my 1200 but I leave a 300 calorie buffer for those moments. \n\n\nSo, if I'm having a binge sort of day, I will allow myself to indulge in the thing I want but making sure that I've given myself the space to do so while also exercising those extra calories away.  It really limits how much you want to binge when you know how damn impossible it is to quickly burn off 1000 extra calories at the end of the day.  That is why I allow for 300 extra calories.  It is enough to get that satisfaction from the food I want while also being not in excess that it can't be burned over with relative swiftness (depending on activity)\n\n\nAlso, of I feel like binging at the end if a full eating day, all I do is remind myself that that food will be available tomorrow and I can have those foods when I have the wiggle room in my calories to have some.  \n\n\nAnd be mindful of the amount your eating.  Choose your snack and stick to the serving size.  Eat slowly so those 27 pieces last and realize that in taking another half serving (depending on the snack) probably won't create too much havoc in your calories for the day that you won't be able to work it off if you need to.","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

{"body":"I'm a 24 y/o 5'2\" female\n\nA few years back, I lost a lot of weight in a very very unhealthy way. Little by little I was able to get away from all that and forget about weight loss for a while, and just be a bit more active. \n\nWhen I decided to get serious again (because I was gaining it back) I started counting calories and decided to go on keto and join a gym. It was hell. I would be at the gym, doing mainly cardio for 2+ hours, eating 1200 cal, AND under 10g of carbs. KILL ME. This wasn't for me because I had a history of an eating disorder and as you can guess, 1200 was NOT enough when I was spending SO much time at the gym. Half assing my workouts, but it was still a lot for only 1200.\n\nI would do great, then binge. It was terrible. I had the \"all or nothing\" mentality for so long. Healthy food, exercise, and under 10g of carbs for a few days, then binge. repeat. I was miserable.\n\nI don't mean to say that Keto is not good, in fact, I think it's a great lifestyle. But I was doing it so wrong. \n\nI have completely changed the way I do things. I do weight training and HIIT for my workouts. I go crazy for an hour rather than half ass it for over 2. Right now I'm trying to lose 10 lbs and \"tone\" so I am still at a deficient in calories, but definitely not strictly 1200. and CARBS! I still watch my carb intake, and try not to eat empty carbs. I try to get them mainly from veggies and fruits. Brown rice maybe, but definitely not everyday. \n\nBut if I want a cookie, I eat the cookie. I just make sure it's still within my calorie limit. \n\nYou don't have to stop eating the things you enjoy, just do it less often and eat less of it. \n\nI am losing the weight, and building muscle.

My husband, for example, could probably eat every single thing in this house in a single sitting and not gain weight. I, on the other hand so much as look at a greasy burger and it's going straight to my hips. So I need to be much more strict, especially because I'm nowhere near as active as he is. I find recipes and prep meals for the meals we share; if either of us are eating alone (him at work or me here by myself), we have to take care of ourselves. He's free to eat whatever he wants when he's out, even if we're out together. So he basically does the same thing your husband does: He eats whatever food while he's out, and I have no interest in his snacks, which are usually pretty healthy, anyway, so he has those anytime. He's perfectly happy letting me do most of the planning, and I enjoy it, anyway. And he doesn't mind the food I make, either. He's usually full at the end of the meal, which is great. And I build in healthy desserts for us that still meet my dietary needs while making sure both of us are getting those little indulgences (a little bit of chocolate goes a long way in this household!). I even have flex room for my own snacks, which most of the year, I really don't do, but since it's heading toward fall, the orchard store reopened with fresh apples, which...man, that really hits the spot sometimes.","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

{"body":"This dish is my variant of a basic Vietnamese Fish soup, which is a soup that was taught to me by my GF and is commonly cooked by my GF and her family (who live in Saigon). It is actually a really forgiving recipe in that you can vary the amounts of a lot of the ingredients pretty substantially and still get something tasty out the other side. \n\nNotes: \n\n* This is a great dish for getting a solid amount of calcium if you can't stand milk. \n* The only slightly difficult thing to find is the mushroom seasoning/broth granules. They should be available at any Asian grocery store, and are available on Amazon (at a bit of a high price under Mushroom Seasoning), you can substitute vegetarian broth seasoning to replace but it isn't the same. \n* You can certainly replace the seafood mix with any white fish that you desire and it will come out good, this is what the original recipe uses. That being said, the mixed seafood adds an additional depth of flavor though that you don't get with a single fish.\n* Keep the rice noodles separate from the soup until you are ready to serve. This is especially true if you plan to eat this over several days like I do. The first time I made the dish, I mixed everything together and when I came back the noodles had mostly dissolved. This resulted in a soup that had a consistency closer to porridge than soup. \n* You can add more water and mushroom seasoning wihtout affecting the calories much.\n\n\n\n**Vietnamese-Style Seafood Soup**\n\n*Ingredients:*\n\n* 1 Pack of Trader Joes Seafood Blend (around 500g)\n* 1 Large Tomato, diced\n* 1/2 large white onion, diced\n* 50g of fresh green dill\n* Mushroom/Vegetable seasoning granules (add to taste, I usually use around 20g across the whole dish)\n* 150-200g diced mushrooms\n* 120g Rice noodles (thicker noodles work better but any work fine)\n* Lime\n* Fresh red chili pepper, diced\n* Water \n\n*Instructions*\n\n1.  In a large sauce pan, cook the diced tomato over medium/high heat until fully and heavily cooked and mostly liquid.\n2. Add the pack of Trader Joes Seafood Blend to this and around 10g of the Mushroom/Vegetable broth granules. This is your only chance to give some seasoning to the seafood, so it is good to add here\n3. Allow to cook until the seafood is almost fully cooked. \n4. Add the diced mushrooms and add water (I usually add a bowl which I guess is around 500-700ml) and allow it to return to a boil.\n5. Add the rest of the mushroom seasoning (to taste).\n5. While the above is going on, dice up your 1/2 large white onion and your dill.\n6. Cut the heat entirely and add the white onion and dill. You do NOT want the onion fully cooked like you would in western recipes. This recipe actually uses the bright bite of the white onion to add a layer of depth to the dish. \n7. Boil and strain the rice noodles. \n8. When serving, combine the noodles and the soup. Add the proper amount of diced chili pepper and squeeze a wedge of lime into the soup (I usually use about 1/8-1/10 of a lime each time). \n9. Enjoy the complex spicy, sour, savory, meaty flavored soup.\n\nMakes 4 VERY nice sized bowls of soup. Stats per bowl:\n\nCalories: 236, Fat: 0.2g, Carbs: 34.0g, Protein: 23.6g and oddly enough Calcium: 33.4% (dill is high in calcium).\n\nEDIT: Wow, not sure why multiple people down voted my recipe.

The good thing about a job is that most of the time you don't have the time to snack until a meal break or ten minute break. And if you fill those with a walk around the neighborhood, you'll find that you *might* do fine until the evening.\n\nPersonally, I think we have all lost touch with what an empty stomach actually feels like. It's OK to be hungry sometimes. We're eating way fewer calories than our brain and body are used to, and all change is uncomfortable. Because hunger isn't really pain. If anything, pain is the sensation we feel when we eat too much!\n\nI'm rambling a little here, but I guess my point is that a) it's ok to be a little (or even a lot) hungry (obviously don't starve yourself tho!), and b) we should all get in touch with what hunger feels like, and even befriend it a little since we are going to have to learn to live with it at least some of the time.","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

{"body":"- Sushi (a chain near me makes great sushi, and has the nutrition info on the packaging, but there are a lot of local restaurants that make it fast as well - avoid things with breading or cream cheese, you can also get sashimi to avoid all the calories/carbs from the rice). \n\n- Salads, I just use a portion of the dressing and avoid ones loaded with things like cheese &amp; bacon. Practically *everywhere* makes some kind of good salad and grocery stores usually have prepared ones too - avoid fast food ones, as I've read places like McDs soak their salad greens in sugar water to make them taste better and keep their appearance longer. \n\n- Veggie sandwich of some sort on a whole wheat wrap or panini, ask for light condiments and avoid loads of cheese, bacon, etc. A local place has a zucchini, red pepper, basil, onion and mushroom grilled panini that is amazing (about 300-500 calories depending on size and contents).\n\n- Non-cream based soups are usually super low calorie (they're like 80% water). Even a beef or chicken broth soup won't run you much, but obviously veggie heavy soups are better. \n\n- Rice bowls. Half of a Moe's rice bowl with salsa, dollop of sour cream, side of guac, grilled mushrooms, onions and peppers, pinto and black beans, corn pico de gallo, cucumber, and cilantro is around 370 calories and 12 grams of fat. Obviously, you can change up the ingredients a lot. A lot of times a large tortilla has more calories and less nutrition than just getting something over a reasonable amount of rice. Remember things like corn taco shells and nachos are fried. Places like Chipotle make similar items. \n\n- Most taco places will have soft shell flour or corn tortillas (baked not fried) and some type of vegetarian option. Beans can be caloric, so don't go crazy (ex: half cup pinto beans at around 80 calories, half cup black beans at around 120), and avoid deep fried tofu. For instance, 6\" corn tortilla (not fried), red onion, skinless chicken thigh, citrus salsa and cilantro taco from a local place here is around 250 calories, 10g of fat and 18g of protein. A grilled fish taco will run about the same.\n\n- Most Chinese take out places will have steamed vegetable dishes, with or without shrimp, chicken or tofu, with sauce and rice on the side. You can ask for brown rice a lot of places now too. You can also get lightly stir fried items, like bean curd with vegetables, if you know it's a place that doesn't go crazy with the oil. Chinese style stir frying is done at high temperatures and to my understanding little of the oil is absorbed since the outside of the food flash fries so quickly.\n\n\n\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

When I was 19 and 98lbs my hair was falling out, I had amenorrhea for almost a year, started to experience frequent injuries when running, and had horrible anxiety and depression. Being underweight can be just as detrimental to your health as being overweight, and just like being overweight it can sometimes take awhile for your to see just how much damage you are doing. I didn't experience issues right away, but it caught up to me.\n\nA major symptom underweight women experience is osteopenia that can morph into full blown osteoporosis at a very very young age. You do not want that, because you don't recover from osteoporosis.  Being underweight generally also means muscle loss, including your heart. Infertility is another major side-effect of being underweight.\n\nBeing underweight is also linked to causing or worsening disorders like depression and anxiety. Not to mention, not eating enough will affected your cognition, which won't be good for your studies. Dropping further in weight or staying underweight for a long period of time can also cause brain damage.\n\n I glanced at your post history, because sometimes pro-eating disorder people post here trying to get attention to fuel their disorder. While I'm glad that doesn't seem to be the case here, it's still a little concerning. You know your are underweight, you know and show concerns about the consequences of being underweight, and you seem to have issues with binging and emotional eating. Go talk to your mental health counselors on campus, your primary doctor, and/or a psychologist about your anxiety regarding food, your weight, and any other thing that is causing you stress. Regardless of your weight, the anxiety you are experiencing is not normal. You may be in the beginning stages of an eating disorder, and/or you may have an anxiety disorder.

{"body":"Micronutrient(vitamin and mineral) deficiencies. \n\nEating a day at TDEE. Meaning you don't eat more than you burn but you also don't eat less. So say you burn 2000 calories a day. To gain weight you eat more than that, to lose weight you eat less and to stay the same weight you eat 2000 calories. \n\nShort and thin women burn very little which means to lose or even maintain in some cases we have to eat small amounts. So at my height and weight(5'2 and 130 pounds) if I do no exercise at all I burn about 1530 calories. If I eat that much I will probably get most if not all my micro nutrients that I need. To lose though at a one pound a week rate I would have to eat 1030 calories a day. At that low amount it's less likely to get what I need so I need to supplement and take frequent diet breaks and have one to two days a week where I eat 1530 calories to prevent that. Alternatively I could eat 1200 a day and take fewer maintenance breaks(once a month). But 1200 is the low for the average woman to get all the nutrients she needs(1500 for men) so below that amount requires more diligence in diet and sometimes(or more like almost always) closer Doctor supervision.\n\nShort women can combat this by becoming more active and/or gaining muscle.

Then I'll eat half of a banana or half of a pear (my son will eat the other half). Then I'll do lunch. I like to cook and try different meals but sometimes I'll stick with what's simple and easy. For my lunch or dinner if I'm not really with a lot of time to cook I will eat stuff like:\n\n-roasted sweet potato or any vegetables such as broccoli, aspargus, eggplant, mushrooms, zucchini, cauliflower, green beans etc... saut\u00e9ed or roasted\n\n-chicken or fish, grilled or baked\n\n-poached or hard boiled egg\n\n-sandwich- whole wheat bread with maybe some spinach or arugula, cold meat cuts or maybe some meat that I may have cooked the previous days sliced, no fat feta cheese, low cal mayo sometimes... you get the picture basically you make a sandwich having in mind the calories of the items you are using and I always try to stay around 300 calories on my sandwiches\n\nThose are easy things that you can pre make or easily whip up.\n\nI also like to snack on baby carrots and sugar snap peas with hummus, nutrigrain bars (the apple ones are so good), sugar free jello, yogurt, watermelon, strawberries, grapes, bananas, pears, oranges... all great things for you to pack and bring with you\n\nAnd I probably have a couple 300 calorie meals a day and then 6 \"snacks\" under or around 100 calories. \n\nWhat helps me is plan everything ahead.

{"body":"[edit: she's only been counting calories for 2wks, so I think it's fair to say that weight loss is not really measurable in that amount of time, due to some reasons I listed below!]\n\nThese comments are a little misguided. It is NOT ALWAYS \"calories in, calories out\" for weight loss, especially for people w/special circumstances. For example: athletes with a lot of exercise (gaining more muscle weight... if you are not losing weight but looking more toned, that's the culprit!!) or people with hormone imbalances, etc. \n\nIf I were you: 1) I would start measuring my waist/arms/thighs/etc to see if you are at toning up, which is the same if not better than losing weight, and 2) go to the doctor to get your thyroid tested, etc.\n\nI also have no clue how long you've been keeping this up. If all else is well, then after a few months you should definitely be shedding weight, even if you are literally shedding muscle weight (very possible at the amt of calories you are getting.) But if it's only been a few weeks, then water/clothes/even hair weight can literally add up to a lot. A glass of water can be up to 1lb, and apparently women's clothing is about 2lbs (2.5 for men.)\n\nWater weight can shift 5lbs day to day.\nThat means if you are on average, 165 lbs, then one day when you don't have a lot of water you may be 160 lbs. And then all of a sudden, on a day where you're hydrating a lot, you may be 170 lbs (because +5 from your average weight.) \n\nalso 160-170 is a huge weight difference??

Started working out, started tracking calories in February - now I'm down to 136! The best thing about tracking is that it encourages me to workout (so that I can have a bit more leeway). That incentive has turned exercise into a habit for me and I am so much healthier now!\n\n2. Temporary-ish.

Getting used to feeling full on less food and figuring out how to balance the foods I crave with a diet that allows me to eat enough volume/nutrients to feel full and healthy.

This made 6 large servings using my proportions.\n\nSome things I added/changed: I used chicken thighs and doubled the veggies.

Also, I allowed it to cook on low for around 8 hours and it ended up being much thicker than the recipe recommends, but I preferred it this way. \n\nAlso my favorite thing about this recipe logistically speaking is that it allowed me to get rid of a bunch of veggies that were going bad in the fridge, and all I had to add was some cans I always have on hand and some chicken.

{"body":"My store's generic brand of nonfat Greek yogurt is consistently disappointing unless I use it in baked goods as a fat replacement. It's so damn runny. I really don't notice much of a difference texturally between it and the low-fat regular yogurt.\n\nI'm echoing someone else's suggestion of Better'n Peanut Butter - fuck that stuff.\n\nI also looked for low-carb, low-calorie, whole-wheat tortillas that were described in one of the recipes on SkinnyTaste...these tortillas didn't exist in my store, and I'm not spending $10 to get them online. All of the other flour tortillas were super high in calories and/or contained at least one ingredient that literally makes me ill (malted barley flour, oats), so I found this gluten-free alternative called Sandwich Petals that were only 100 calories. I really, really was not impressed. As enchilada wrappers, they sort of melted into nothing, and if I had used them for their intended purpose, which are wraps, it would not have held together at all. If anything, it just made me feel sorry for my father-in-law, who *has* to eat gluten-free. This is what he gets for a tortilla substitute?\n\nI can't stand most protein bars, and the ones that I can either contain oats or tree nuts, which make me ill. One that I remember in particular are the thinkThin bars that my old trainer (back when I had money) made me try one day. After a bite, I politely smiled and told her I'd think about making a trip to Trader Joe's (where she said she found them) to get them. They had them in the peanut butter flavor at my internship this summer, and I had the exact same reaction - grainy, very blatant artificial sugar taste, the chocolate tasted like nothing...just hated them. And they didn't curb my appetite one bit. Plus, they contain maltitol, which is one of the worst offenders for gastrointestinal effects.\n\nI can't do most artificial sweeteners all on their own, so I found one that is the closest to sugar I can get (erythritol), and if I use it by itself, it's in coffee only. Everything else, I just halve the sugar called for in the recipe and replace it with erythritol (it measures like sugar) so it's less noticeable.\n\nAnother big one: Fat-free cream cheese. Grainy as hell. I'll take Neufchatel or Greek yogurt cream cheese over that any day if I ever feel like having cream cheese around.\n\nAnd finally, turkey bacon. That shit does not get crisp enough, and I actually like chewy regular bacon with crisp edges. Turkey bacon doesn't even get chewy - it gets floppy. Just no. I'll just use less of the real stuff.","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

{"body":"&gt; dry taste that makes me want sweets and sugar afterwards. Is there a reason for this?\n\nNo. Honestly this is a first, I've never heard of this. I've eaten Quorn for 12 or so years, fed it to probably a couple hundred others, and never had someone complain of it being dry. The normal complaint is actually that it is too moist/spongy and doesn't mimic the firmer, stringy texture of muscle fibre. \n\nQuorn, unless you are cooking it really badly, should not be dry. As you put it in a chilli, this shouldn't be an issue. Are you buying it from the same place, could there be an issue with storage or transport that is affecting the taste? Is it still well in date? Frozen products have a shelf life too and the taste goes to shit even if it's still safe to eat.\n\nThere is a condition called reactive hypoglycemia which can cause your blood sugar to drop and crave sweets to bring it back to a normal level. However this is normally from carb-heavy foods like potatoes or bread with simple sugars and not much protein or fibre.

{"body":"Most diet ice creams are just really bad. Those that aren't, are often not much better calorie wise then the real stuff. \n\nAdd to that, anyone that eats low carb had one or two really bad options. So you have most dieting groups seeing it as an option. Low calorie, low fat, low carb, and with plenty of protein.\n\nFor most people the taste is like real ice cream. I think there are some people more sensitive to certain artificial flavors, but it seems a minority. \n\nThe texture is different. I think most people who don't like it, don't like the texture. You likely need to let it warm up to soft serve, or you won't like it either. If you have a very cold freezer/house it may take longer then the recommended 5 minutes.\n\nTaste wise it doesn't stand up to premium ice creams, more like regular ice cream. If it was a full calorie ice cream it would not be anything really special. I think a number of people are also disappointed by that.\n\nFYI, I usually love vanilla, but find theirs a bit disappointing. People tend to love or hate the lemon.

{"body":"I'm not very fond of the way microwave popcorn smells, and how it tends to make the microwave smell strongly for sometimes days and weeks afterward.  And god forbid if you burn it just slightly in there, it gets worse.\n\nI prefer to make my popcorn in a 3 quart no-stick pot w/lid on the stove. 1/2 cup of unpopped kernels fits perfectly in this pot (as the kernels shouldn't overlap for best results).   I used to have an old aluminum pot I loved for this, but the no-stick works just fine. \n\nGeneral directions:\n\n- Add 2-3 tbsp of favorite oil to pot\n- Turn stove to med (or low-med if yours runs hot)\n- Place three kernels in pot, put lid on pot\n- Stand there and watch and listen, once all three have popped, add 1/2 cup kernels, put lid back on\n- Pick up pot, and swish the kernels around over the burner to make sure all of them are oil coated, place back on burner\n- Occasionally pick up pot and swish it around over the burner, maybe two or three more times before and during popping\n- Once popping slows down to one or two pops, remove from heat and dump into huge plastic bowl.  Don't try to get 100% of the kernels popped, you'll just burn the other popcorn.  The last 5-10 unpopped can just be tossed out.  Sometimes the popcorn might start to push the lid open, that's ok.  You can either briefly take it off the heat and dump some in the bowl, or just let it go.  If you aren't overfilling the pot, it won't make a mess.\n\nThen after that I weigh my popcorn into 28g portions, place in baggies and pour on two servings of my favorite seasonings (Kernel Seasonings are pretty great, btw).  You can shake the zipped up baggies to spread the seasoning around.  Or add more or less, whatever suits you.\n\nThis amount usually makes me three good 28g portions, and one extra bag of less at the end.  Usually around 20-22g, and I try and leave all the unpopped stuff out so it doesn't mess up my weights.\n\nIf you don't have an air popper, this method is just about as good (and honestly less messy to clean up).\n\nEdits for spelling.","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

{"body":"I discovered that much of my binge/deny cycle has to do with my emotions and/or my feelings of self-control (or, whether or not I feel like someone else is trying to control me). \n\nBasically, if everything in my life feels like it's out of control, I tend to either binge on a lot of food at one time until I'm almost sick, or just refuse to eat until the feelings of hunger or faintness become too much for me to deal with. \n\nYes, it's absolutely fucked up.\n\nWhat actually ended up helping me attempt to gain control of this cycle?  First, using MyFitnessPal.  It allows me to see eating patterns and prevents me from binges (most of the time) because of the shame of entering those calories into my public diary.  Secondly, meal prep and having high protein snacks available so I can make good choices in a pinch.  If it's easy for me to grab and go with a healthy option, I will.  If I have nothing available to me, I will tend to want to open myself up to bad choices.  Thirdly, I have a medication for my metabolic disorder that helps A LOT when it comes to appetite and sugar cravings. It has some heinous side-effects, so it's hard to stay on it sometimes (Metformin), but when I'm on it and taking it consistently, my sugar cravings all but disappear.   Those things still don't mean I'm perfect at resisting a binge entirely, but in conjunction they seem to eliminate the issue about 80-90% of the time.\n\nFood has been there for me during some very difficult times in my life and it's often hard to give up those comforts when, literally, that comfort has been there for you for most of your life.  But, I'm honest with myself.  I know that behavior is bad bad bad for me.  I don't want my child to turn to food in the same way I did.  I want better for her.

{"body":":) Hi!\n\nWell, a couple things could be going on. The first is that you could be under-estimating calories. Are you weighing food? Calorie counting even the oil that you fry things in? Spices? Etc. Calories sometimes tend to sneak in there when you least expect them, especially if you go off of nutrition labels. The suggested serving size versus the actual serving size tends to be off. (Ex: 28g or approximately 28 nuts, but you measure 17 nuts to be 28g, so the nut suggestion is off by quite a bit). \n\nThe second is that you are just adjusting to the new dietary changes. I've seen a lot of people in /r/loseit have similar problems, saying they have trouble at first eating 1200 a day especially if they do a whole diet revamp. Eventually it seems to go away, but I can see how it would be worrisome at first. You could try adding some healthy high-calorie snacks into your regimen, such as nuts (peanuts, cashews, almonds, etc.) since they tend to be small in serving size but pack a lot of calories into it. \n\nI wouldn't force yourself to eat until your sick. Rather, just try to incorporate foods that are a bit higher in calorie until your body adjusts (if you find that you are in fact counting the calories accurately).\n\n:) Hope this helps!","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

{"body":"That's going to be too low to maintain long term. I am M/28/178 at starting, with an office job but am on my feet a ton for an office job, and limited exercise as I cook for me, girlfriend, and dog most of the time and only really home from 6pm-10pm before sleep, and 5am-7am before work, so other than walking the dog no exercise anymore. I started 1200 is plenty on Monday, and plan to go maybe a week tops, just to get myself accustomed to eating healthier again. It is practical in that you have to know the foods and general idea of macros to balance eating this few calories while also getting necessary nutrients in, and eating food that will keep you full. For me that is eating a lot of low calorie, high volume foods, such as soups with a lot of veggies, raw carrots/cucumber/celery, something that keeps you eating for awhile, and low calorie protein sources, such as greek yogurt and protein bars. Allowing yourself small treats such as 1 piece of chocolate also works well.\n\nThat said, for either of us, 1200 calories is just not even close to sustainable long term, and you will start to notice consequences after some time. Your body burns way too many calories, even if you were to sit in bed 22 hours a day, and you will see a huge dropoff in energy levels, and have headaches and just not want to do anything anymore. Maybe give it a week at 1200, just to kickstart things, and then then I would suggest upping calories to 1600-1800 depending on activity level. You will still drop weight at either of these calorie amounts with ease, but will be healthier for you overall. Just make sure to use the same principals as you are using now, healthy, volumeous foods that will keep you satiated, don't think oh I have another 600 calories daily now, let me eat 600 calories worth of ice cream, chips, etc. Good luck to you man, feel free to add me on myfitnesspal if you would like, mine is WilliamChevett.","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

It got here, and OMG IT'S WONDERFUL.  99% of the hulls just crust/crunch up without any real substance, and I don't seem to be having any issues with eating it (knock on wood) so far.  Popcorn is one of my absolute favorite things, and I couldn't have it.  But now, I can!  After like a 9-year hiatus, it's back!  And with great timing, too, since it's so low cal for so much.\n\nLow carb wraps.  These things have so much fiber, and I really needed more in my diet.  Not only are the calories low (60-80 depending on brand) but the fiber is 6-12g which is amazing.  The whole wheat kind tend to be on the higher side of fiber, in case anyone was wondering.  I've been getting La Tortilla Factory brand, and Tumaro (although these are on mail order since I can't find them locally, we'll see how they compare).\n\nHALO TOP ICE CREAM.  Yes, it's been mentioned.  I'm just gonna mention it again.\n\nTurkey everything, but especially turkey pepperoni.  Half the calories of normal pepperoni, and pretty much tastes the same.  It's awesome to spruce up salads, sandwiches, pizzas, or just a tasty snack.\n\nWater enhancers!  You know, those 0 cal bottles of flavor you squeeze into your water to make it less boring?  Store brand works for me.  My husband and I have made a game out of trying every single kind we can find and rating them.  :)\n\nWhole dill pickles!  And various other pickled stuff like asparagus, green beans, etc.  These are ridiculously low cal, usually 5-10 or less each, and one or two is almost always enough to be completely satisfying without a sodium overload.\n\nAlmond Milk!  I love cereal, and get a pretty wholesome brand (Mom's Best Naturals) but was feeling a bit down because the milk calories can be a bit excessive on a restrictive diet.  Changed over from 2% milk, to 1% milk to unsweetened almond milk, and LOVE it!  I'm not really missing the old milk.  Not even in recipes either.

Once you get the ratios of the base down your good to go, thing is each person has their preference for the ratios which drastically changes taste and texture.

But the usual seems to be 2 part oats(the quick 1 min oats don't really work for this too good but some people like it anyways but it dissolves far too much and fast leaving a mushy mess, get old fashioned)1 part milk 1 part Greek yogurt. That's it, make sure you measure and have the milk and yogurt equal about the same amount of oats.                                                            From there on it's tinkering with the amount of the base to change it's consistency and messing with different recipes out there, make sure it gets about 8-9 hours in that fridge soaking up and maybe wait to put on the fruits topping or other ingredients that might spoil a bit in the morning instead of at night, that way the blueberries or strawberries aren't all mushy by the time u get to them.

{"body":"Every person's body is different. Fat free potato chips are famous for causing oily diarrhea accidents when people eat 4x as much for the same calories, instead of eating 1 serving at a time. Also many people get gastric problems (bloating, diarrhea, etc.) from many kinds of artificial sweeteners used in diet sweets. There's also things like, people drinking 5 Diet Cokes a day, because '0 calories and no proven cancer link,' but then all the acid ends up being terrible for their teeth.\n\nPlus there's always new research coming out that discovers health effects of otherwise healthy foods eaten in large amounts (mercury in tuna, isoflavones in soy, oxalate in spinach), and that makes some people try to eat a variety of things rather than rely heavily on particular things. Like for example, I *personally* would consider 4 servings of any one food (which is what a pint of ice cream is), every single day, to be a lot. You can be pretty sure that using a product an average/typical amount isn't likely to cause unforeseen problems, because thousands of people do the same thing every year, so it's relatively unlikely that some horrible thing escaped observation. But if you're an outlier, eating way more than most people do, it's a little risker. Sure, there's testing before a product is released, but that doesn't catch 100% of longterm health effects.\n\nSo basically, yeah Halo Top uses a natural sugar substitute... fine. Does that mean you should eat 4 servings of it every day? Who knows. If your food system works for you then that's great. Some people try to switch it up to avoid potential downfalls of any one food, but that's more about a \"better safe than sorry\" mindset, than about measurable consequences. If it causes more problems than it's worth *for you*, then do what works for you.\n\n(Edited a typo)","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

Diet does go a long way in losing/maintaining weight, but at this point a plateau signifies that you need to increase the calories going out, as opposed to further decreasing those coming in. \n\nOne of the most surprising things, for me anyway, was how much my body changed by taking a daily walk (1-2 miles to start). Especially after being mostly sedentary due to work and other commitments. I get to go outside for a good 30 minutes, listen to music, walk my dog, etc. I picked up a fitbit to track my daily steps, as well as my workouts (which then syncs with MFP). \n\nMy partner and I have since started walking 5 miles per night, and I *finally* got back into the gym to tone up and build some muscle. With the increase in muscle (obviously not bulking) my body's metabolism has increased, meaning my body is now more effective at burning calories (including calories used when working out), and my BMR may have increased with consistent daily physical activity and changes in my body's composition.  \n\nYou might also look into toying with your macronutrients, but I don't really know enough about that to give worthwhile advice.

{"body":"I don't remember where I read it--probably some shitty magazine that was trying to monetize the idea of women's empowerment--but I bought into the idea that in order to be happy, I needed to get rid of my scale. So I did. I had no concept of my weight for four years. I knew I'd gone up a couple sizes, but I blamed it on stress and thought that I'd get back to my baseline eventually. Then one year at Christmastime my sisters told me they wanted to lose weight and we should all join MFP. I weighed myself so I could get an accurate starting point. I'd gained fifty pounds in those four years. I'd thought it was closer to twenty, but I was way off. Those \"couple of sizes\" I'd gone up? I went from a S/M to an XL--from a 6/8 to a 14/16. I'm 5'3\". I was at the point that I was having trouble finding clothes to wear in mainstream stores but I was still a little too small to shop in plus size stores.\n\nI started tracking right away and bought a scale when the New Year's fitness sales were happening. I can tell you that it was quite literally life-changing. The extra weight had made my knees ache and made me unable to do things I loved like hiking and snowshoeing and just being active in general. As I gained weight, it was like I became invisible. It really did a number on my self-esteem. I stopped caring about how I dressed or presented myself with regards to hair, makeup, etc. I'm not saying those things are essential for everyone, but for me they were always hobbies that I enjoyed, and when I was at my heaviest, I stopped caring because it felt like there was no point; no matter how my hair looked or whether my makeup was perfect, I was still invisible, so why bother trying? When I see pictures of myself from that time, it's hard to look at them because I remember how bad I felt about myself and how unhappy I was.\n\nNow I'm within fifteen pounds of the weight I was when I was in my teens and early twenties. I still have about twenty pounds to lose to get to my goal weight, but my progress so far has been really encouraging. I'm much more active than I used to be and I'm able to do the things I missed so much when I was unhealthy--hiking, caving, walking up a flight of stairs without getting winded. I'm also much happier with my physical appearance. I look like myself again, not like I'd taken over a stranger's body.","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

I'll then start adding healthy fillers until it's 5 meals (one for dinner Sunday night). For instance I'll do 1 cup cooked brown rice and 1 cup cauliflower rice. Then I'll add in any frozen or fresh veggies on hand. Last time it was a green bean stir-fry mix. It ended up being 5 meals at 325 calories each. I record everything as I go on the MFP recipe creator so I stop adding when I see the calorie count between 300-350 and think that I would be full on one of those servings. It all goes into one large container and then I portion out one fourth every day, knowing that if I overeat on Mon and Tues I'll have nothing on Thurs. \n\nThis has really helped save calories, money, and time. I've also done this for pasta dishes that start at, say, 350 calories with 3 servings.

{"body":"The first time I went on a 1200-calorie restricted diet was in 2012, and I was in my late twenties. It worked very fast and seemed really easy. Now it's four years later, and it doesn't feel like it's working as fast. It's possible that my age has affected it and my metabolism has slowed (or maybe I'm just impatient), but there are more factors at play.\n\n1. The first time around, my husband was working swing shift and I worked days. This made it very easy for me to eat healthy, low-calorie meals for lunch and dinner because I only had to consider myself. He's now working day shift as well, and he needs more calories than I do; he's almost a foot taller than I am and he works in a very active job. He also likes to have snacks like popcorn later in the evening, and we will drink beer or wine or cocktails a few times a week.\n1. I'm less active because I now work from home three days a week and go to the office only two days instead of going into the office all five days. \n1. I suffered an injury to my hip that makes it hard to get motivated to push past the pain and get out and hike as much as I used to. Ironically, activity makes it feel better in the long run, but when my hip is hurting so badly that it sends pain shooting all the way to my ankle, the last thing I want to do is get up and go for a five-mile hike. This is something I just have to power through, because sitting around being a whiny couch potato is the worst thing I can do.\n\nSo I've had to approach the diet differently than I did the first time. I've tried to find low-calorie alternatives to the cocktails I used to drink (hello, gin and soda) and to restrict my intake of them when I do drink. The popcorn isn't that big of a deal; it's lower in calories than the other snacks we used to eat. On my work from home days, I try to use my stationary cycle (which is the single best exercise I can do for my hip aside from the physical therapy stretches). And on weekends, I'm trying to push myself to get out and do more adventuring than I have been. ","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

{"body":"A lot of other people have a lot of this shit covered, but here's how it goes for me. I'm an emotional binger, I also have a history of eating disorders - first anorexia, then bulimia. Those were many years ago though, I no longer suffer as extremely. \n\n1) Meal prep. I cook big batches of stuff and portion them out, or just slice casseroles into rectangles and only eat one, or one bowl of soup.\n\n2) Smaller dishes. If I put the aformentioned casserole rectangle on a large plate, I'll want more. I'll want to fill my plate. **If** I use a big plate, I fill the spaces with green beans, carrots, broccoli. Veggie sides. No carbohydrate sides, no extra meat sides, no extra cheese. Veggies or fruit only.\n\n3) Think it out. Why do I want this? *I'm tired*. Take a nap. Am I really hungry? *Yeah, ravenous.* Ok let's try a sandwich first then. Am I too busy to make food at home? *Y-yeah...?* No, think about this, reijn - you'll have to drive through traffic to fast food, order, **pay for it**, drive home, and eat. You could just drive home and microwave something or make a sandwich. And you're wasting money on food.\n\n4) Eat something really fatty and satisfying along with some high volume low calorie food. Cheese and meat cubes, and a lot of green beans. Cheese and meat almost 100% of the time fixes the urge to binge, and then I fill the rest of the tummy space with veggies. \n\n5) Drink lots of water. LOTS. I pee at least once an hour, it's actually really annoying (no I'm not diabetic). \n\n6) Strict meal times. Breakfast between 6-8am (then I go to work). Lunch at noon. One snack time is allowed at work, before or after lunch depending on what I need, always something under 100 calories. Dinner at 5pm. Snack before bed at 9pm, under 200 calories. \n\n7) Eat the same thing all the time. I like what I eat, so I don't mind. M-F same breakfast and lunch, and a safe list of snacks. Dinner is where it varies week to week, because dinner is where I find my most meal excitement. I save most of my calories for dinner also. \n\n8) Absolutely under no circumstances do I ever keep junk food in my house. No candy, cookies, chips, pretzels, crackers. No microwave burritos (except my meal prep breakfast burritos), pizzas, hot pockets etc. No ice cream (occasional Halo Top, but rarely because that is a dangerous habit to get back into at this point). I stupidly bought a box of brownie mix and intended to only have 1-2. Guess what? I ate half the pan one night and the other half the pan the next night. (I've been eating clean for so long that it gave me the worst diarrhea, too.) So I remove the temptation. My salty snack is popcorn, I also have mixed nuts but I don't have control problems with nuts (a small palm full is enough). My sweet snack is 1/4c granola in 1/2c almond milk, or fruit. If I feel like I'm losing my mind and **\"need\"** something, I will eat those first and then reevaluate... 100% of the time I feel satisfied afterward. \n\nMost of these steps help me manage my hunger, but step 3 is what helps me most when dealing with urges to binge. I talk it out. Sometimes I'll convince myself it's OK to get some junk food and I'll be all ready for it, then I'll get in my car and think \"god this is a waste of my time and money\".

{"body":"No offense taken, I wonder the same stuff.\n\nMy BMR is about 3200 last I checked (possibly higher since most calculators assume a more average amount of muscle mass), then I average about 14-16 hours a week of serious exercise a week, plus I walk everywhere and spend my weekends doing active stuff.  Thus my TDEE comes out to 4000-4500.  I've only actually put on about 25-30lbs in the last year, yet my bodyfat% hasn't visibly changed.  Honestly I'm excited to start cutting down in a month or two because the amount I cook and eat is excessive and the hippy in me feels bad about the carbon footprint of eating as much meat as I do.\n\nHealth wise, I'm weirdly healthy.  Last time I had bloodwork done, everything was where it should be. my blood pressure over the last few years averages ~80/125.  I assume that's because I have a healthy diet and I'm very active. I do about 80% of my own veggie heavy cooking where most of my fats come from olive oil, I don't use almost any sugar (I don't enjoy sweets or drink soda), I gravitate towards whole grains etc. and I never eat fast food and almost no junk food. That said, I eat two massive wet burritos at least once a week, so I'm not claiming to have some massively healthy diet.\n\nAs to why? Because I can.  I've got a small window where I have the resources and time to have the privilege of treating working out and my fitness in general as my main priority.

{"body":"I am turning 28 as well this year, but I find my numbers to be very accurate and my weight to be predictable. We are still young my friend, so I wouldn't worry about your age yet!\n\nAs for not losing weight, it is more likely that either your eating habits or your lifestyle has changed since you were younger. The thing that has brought me the most success is investing time (and money) in getting good data. I use an app and a food scale to measure accurate calories in, and an activity tracker with heart rate to measure calories out, and a scale with body fat percentage to measure my results. Then I use an online trend tool to get rid of anomalous days. Honestly if you have all that it's pretty hard not to lose weight. If you're struggling to estimate calories in, it might be worth having a few weeks where you only buy food with nutritional info on the package.\n\nBut I saw your comments about disordered eating earlier in life, and I know exactly what you mean. For me, having the rich data helped me to make another change, which was to change how I measure success. So now, instead of trying to loose weight quickly to get to my goal as fast as possible, I am taking it slowly and accepting that I need to do something that I can do for life. I can't be hungry and dizzy and sad for life, so I won't go there again. Now, I'm taking it slowly and treating any day where I was happy but didn't put on weight as a success. If you only loose weight on 1 in 10 days but you never put on weight, then eventually you will reach your goal.\n\nSo far I've been going for over a year and I've lost about 50lb and about 12% body fat, and I feel on top of the world. I have 1200 kcal days when I feel like it and maintenance days when I feel like it, but a lot of the time I would say I hang out at 200 kcal deficit, and that's all it takes to loose weight. I really recommend going slow and steady if you can, in order to build a good relationship with food. I used to have the all or nothing mindset, and it made me very sad and very unhealthy.\n\nBest of luck! We still have our lives ahead of us!","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

Although /r/keto can be a bit hivemind, I have lurked there for years and I would say that following that type of diet has been paramount in restoring me to food sanity.\n\nOther things that have helped include:\n\n* Therapy - I avoided it for years, but having had therapists who work in addiction or specifically with eating disorder issues has made a huge difference in my life.  I'm also on a low dose antidepressant/anti anxiety med, so I feel a lot more stable, in general.\n\n* Regular Medical Checkups - I had an undiagnosed thyroid condition that led to anxiety, which led to binge issues.\n\n* Mindfulness - I would suggest starting with a book by Jennifer Taitz, entitled, **End Emotional Eating**.  This book was recommended to me by a therapist and it has been helpful beyond words.\n\n* Overeater's Anonymous - They have meetings in person, but they also have round the clock meetings online.\n\nI wish you the best of luck!

{"body":"&gt; If I eat one more lean cuisine I will fucking shoot myself.\n\nHahaha, yes! I tried the whole \"frozen meal\" route briefly and with few exceptions they are damn terrible (the nutrition content is usually not great, and the salt/sugar super high). A coworker eats one for lunch almost every day (I've seen her do this for *eight years* now) and I have no idea how. \n\nMy tips:\n\n- Get a cheap crockpot and make one pot meals (soup, roasts with veggies, stews, etc) with a combo of veggies, rice and lean protein and add sauces/spices as needed. For instance, I just made enchilada rice with skinless boneless chicken, black rice, pre-made organic enchilada sauce, jarred salsa and a bunch of veggies. Threw it all in the pot, with some extra blended up tomatoes and a bit of water, on low for like three hours while I watched Fear the Walking Dead with my friend. \n\nBam - everything is perfectly cooked, and you have lunch for the whole week. You can even buy single serving glass dishes with tupperware-type lids that you can portion it out in - pop the lid off, throw it in the microwave wherever for two minutes, you're ready to chow. \n\n- I do smoothies for breakfast almost everyday - about half fruit, 1/4 to 1/3 veggies, then some combo of fiber &amp; protein (1% milk, almond milk, veggie protein powder, peanut butter,nuts) with some water. Most pitchers will make three 16oz smoothies - I store them in glass ball jars (the things you do canning in with a metal lid - they're very cheap). \n\nYou can either have one a day for breakfast, or have half with something else, like a serving of quick oats. Smoothies are very filling and if you're wise with ingredients usually between 140-250 calories for a 16oz one. Plus you get *so much produce* and other things in your diet this way you wouldn't necessarily eat enough of and the protein keeps you full. Adding healthy fats in these like avacados, coconut oil, peanut butter (sparingly) and fiber from flax meal or chia seeds help keep you full longer. \n\n- Pre-cook larger batches of vegetables in the oven. Things like beets, pre-peeled carrots, onions, yams, potatoes, turnips - either roast them whole with water in tinfoil or cube them and roast them on a baking tray with a bit of olive oil. It takes like five minutes to prepare them and you just pop them in the oven and go do whatever while they cook. They are a super easy side dish or snack you can just microwave when you want them, or use them cold on top of salads. Cold roasted beet &amp; goat cheese salads with mixed greens are *amazing*.\n\n- I pre-portion snacks in reusable containers that have a separate part for the sauce/dip. For instance, I made up several containers with 2 tablespoons of hummus &amp; 2 tablespoons of diced tomatoes in the \"dip\" part of the container and about 1.5 cups of fresh veggies. Super easy to grab and go, healthy and delicious. You can do variations on this (celery with peanut butter, carrots and cucumber with plain yogurt &amp; spices, etc). I usually only make a few days at a time, so the veggies stay fresh. ","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

For those who like more normal flavours, Peters has their light and creamy line, for about the same number of kj for a scoop.\n\n*Maharajah's Choice garlic pappadums - 119kj (29 cal)/serve, which is about 4 of them?

I personally enjoy lite cool whip. I enjoy it so much I can't buy it, but ymmv so if you can stop at 1/4 cup go for it. Maybe add cocoa powder for chocolate flavor.\n\n4. http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/01/light-and-easy-five-minute-fruit-mousse-dessert-recipe.html &lt;-- this tastes just like fluffy strawberry mousse, which is sort of like strawberry frosting.

You can make the cupcake extra fancy by splitting it in the middle and sticking some sliced strawberries or peaches or something in there, for a little more fiber and also prettiness.

I have coloring books filled with repetitive patterns that start to shut down my mind and keep my hands occupied until I'm tired.\n- If I'm up past midnight for something like grad school work, the act of being occupied mentally doing that helps keep the hungry monster away.\n- Build in flexible room if you can. Then, with that flexibility, give yourself permission to eat something healthy. For example, during the fall and winter, apples are my best friend - we get apples each week from the university's orchard store, and I pair one up with a serving of PB2. For 150 calories at most, I get a filling snack. Another idea: Popcorn. Buy kernels from the store - you don't even need special equipment, necessarily, to air pop it, and you don't need oil. You can make it [on the stove](https://www.eatingvibrantly.com/healthy-oil-free-popcorn/) or [in the microwave](http://www.onegoodthingbyjillee.com/2012/09/microwave-popcorn-no-bag-required.html) just fine, and you get to season it however you like. If you're not into that and you feel like you want butter, I believe 100-calorie bags are available at a store.\n- If you can, stop buying stuff that is overly tempting, or have someone hide it if you want them to still have them. When I dropped 70 pounds, I had a big problem with these almond and chocolate protein bars, and when I wasn't making progress, I had my husband literally hide them. I stopped craving them, and I managed to accidentally find them one day when I went to grab a rarely-used dish from a cabinet months later. But by then, I had no urge. And now I can't even have them because I developed allergies to tree nuts and oats, so that was serendipitous...\n\nBut no matter what, keep in mind that this is a process. It's not easy to make big changes quickly. If you have a bad day, remember: It's only one day. You log, like you already do, hopefully, and you make note of the damage. But that's as long as you can let it hang out in your head. It's just one bad day. Tomorrow's another opportunity to get it right, and you'll be proud when you do. Besides, the mistakes you make today largely balance themselves out on other days. And the flexibility at times helps keep you on task on the other days. That's why I like building in that padding from the start.\n\nIt's a huge mental shift to make, but I think you'll find it easier as time goes on. You're just replacing bad habits with better ones. My habits were pretty much lifelong, and I still falter. You're allowed to slip up once in a blue moon, too. Just remember why you're making that change: You felt in some way that you needed it - that you were worthy of it. You've already made strides in the right direction, so just keep it up.","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

{"body":"- Short term, your body will go into \"starvation mode\" from a large, sudden calorie deficit. This slows your metabolism and makes it hard to impossible to lose. Obviously long-term your body will still lose, but I don't know how long you've been doing this. \n\n- It's not healthy for any but the most diminutive adult to eat 800 calories a day. Your body will do things to try to compensate for this, including cannibalizing muscle tissue in some instances, and it is just hard to get the amount of nutrients (including fat) that your body needs on such a small amount of food.\n\n- In reference to your job, I've been told not to consider things you do daily already as exercise. For instance, we've all seen overweight farmers, contractors, cooks and waitresses - they work physically demanding jobs on their feet and often walk miles a day if they wear a pedometer to check. Their body is used to it. Being physically active at your job is good for keeping your metabolism at a higher average rate than someone like me who sits all day (all things being equal in our physiology/biology otherwise), but not a substitute for intensive exercise and **especially** not for a good, reasonable diet. I doubt your heart rate goes up to fat burning or intensive cardio levels, for instance, from walking around at your job and whatever extra calories you burn in a day (if many, when your metabolism is used to this behavior) versus someone who is sitting can easily be made up for with a bit of unhealthy eating.\n\n- Be super honest with what you're eating and measure, measure, measure. Read labels and ensure you are eating a serving of something instead of guessing. \n\n- Don't get discouraged. People often seen plateaus in weight loss due to a variety of factors. If you are noticing this long-term with a reasonable calorie amount, go to a doctor for some tests to see if you are having issues with your thyroid or something else that would effect your metabolism.\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

{"body":"Meal prep. Don't buy foods you know you'll binge on (I have zero self-control, so the best thing has been just not buying them anymore).\n\nAnd bulk up your meals with \"good\" calories - I just add a shit-ton of vegetables to my meals, and I don't find myself hungry afterward.\n\nAnd the biggest thing for me has been just learning to push through it. Trust me, I still find myself opening the fridge to eat way too much, and I literally have to tell myself to close the damn door, because I know how bad it makes me feel. You're worth it. I know stress makes me weak, too, but I have to tell myself I don't deserve to make myself feel worse by giving in. It helps that I just plain don't keep tempting foods around until I've got my binging urges under control. I lost 70 pounds by forcing myself through the urges to binge. I had my husband hide foods that he's completely okay eating, because I hated depriving him of something he can totally have. The only time some of the weight and bad habits came back was after a cross-country move for my husband's job, then losing my own job shortly after. I lost a year to that cycle. I can't let that be me anymore. It reinforced how vigilant I need to be about my urges.\n\nBut really, literally track everything. Every single thing that goes into your body, even if you binge. The only way for me to keep myself on track is to literally track every bit of food (and calorific drinks) that I consume.

{"body":"Looking at your stats, you've already made progress. So what if you ate over what you would normally eat in sugar? Yesterday was one day. A single day when you had too much of one macro isn't going to kill your diet.\n\nI have the same sort of struggle you do with feeling somewhat full, and for me that comes from a place of shame. I get the feelings of shame because a relative that I was supposed to be able to trust shamed me every single time I ate, full or not. She'd shame me into eating the whole plate (starving kids in Africa, blah blah blah), then shame me for having done so. Despite her, food was a source of comfort for me, so it ended up getting out of control. She'd withhold it from me, too - everyone else was allowed a granola bar out of the cabinet or a few M&amp;Ms from the dispenser on the counter, but if I made any move toward it, I caught hell for it. So I started hiding whenever I ate anything. I'm in my 30s now and can't help but feel ashamed when I have cravings, when I eat something indulgent (and that's even with me building in indulgences to avoid feeling deprived), when I eat even 10 calories above my daily limit, whatever. So what I have to do is remind myself constantly:\n\n* What I am doing is for me.\n* The occasional \"transgression\" is okay. Even a full day \"off the wagon\" is fine, because it's just one day.\n* It's okay (even encouraged!) to feel full, especially if I filled myself up with the \"good\" calories.

Also love their frozen naan if you've got enough cals to add that (230). \n\n* Bambino Pizza Formaggio (small cheese pizzas) - 250 cal each. Good for lunches, or dinner with something added. \n\n* Guilt-free mac and cheese - 270 cal. I usually eat it as a side or add a quick chili to make chili-mac. \n\n* Tomato and roasted red pepper soup - 200 cal for half the carton. I've tried some of their other soups and found them bland, but I really like this one. Great with half of one of their small baguettes for dinner. \n\n* Chile Relleno - 350 cal - A really incredibly cheesy and flavorful dish. \n\n* Frozen tamales - I like the chicken and cheese or beef tamales (240 each). One of my go-to small dinners with a side of rice. \n\n* Refrigerated pastas - I like almost all of their filled pastas, which are surprisingly low calorie. I typically will get the Perline pasta with prosciutto (370 for half package), goat cheese and sundried tomato ravioli (360 for half), arugula and parmigiano ravioli (345 for half), pesto tortellini (330 for half), or the cheese tortellini (360 for half).

For your PA though, if she's tracking your weight over a series of appointments she shouldn't be surprised that you are limiting calories because the weight reduction would show that. \n\nEDIT - forgot to add but I barely ever ate dessert as a vegan because I don't live in an area that has vegan stores, and I am way too lazy to bake desserts. I would constantly bookmark blog posts about treats and so forth and just never make them. There was a set group of foods I would usually go to, and without realizing it I maintained a pretty low calorie diet for many years just due to the unavailability of options that fit my diet. IE, I turned down every donut, every piece of pizza at work, all of the things that just add up over time. If I was a vegan in a place like NYC or San Fran I would probably have spent lots more money on food and weighed significantly more! ","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

{"body":"I recently spent a week in the Malaga area. The main issue I had was that most foods are fried or deep-fried (and those that aren't can sometimes cost quite a bit more, presumably because you have to use higher-quality meat and seafood when you can't disguise it in oil and batter?).\n\nMy advice:\n\n* Do your own shopping if you're able. Instead of eating out, I got a lot of fresh fruit and vegetables from the supermarkets (mostly from a Dia; SuperSol and Mercadona are also reasonably affordable, whereas Supercor has great products but costs more). You'll probably find numerous varieties of fruit cheaper than in your home area, and the produce selection is pretty good. (Pro tip: there are a lot of good deals on melons and stone fruits, which tend to be decent calorie-wise.)\n\n* I also found a few great, low-calorie products on supermarket shelves there that I could use to feed myself - for instance, prepackaged jamon adobado at 83 kcal/100 g, or some startlingly healthy tinned chicken breast meat in olive oil, or some almost-zero-calorie fruit drinks.\n\n* If you're eating in a restaurant, opt for grilled/plancha rather than fried/frito. Everything involves a lot of olive oil (or occasionally sunflower oil), even if the menu doesn't indicate, so feel free to ask about that, or to request less of it. If you're having tapas, there are some lighter options (the salads, obviously, but almost every tapas place also has a fish kebab that's just white fish and grilled vegetables, and the melon-and-ham is pretty healthy).\n\n* There are plenty of chain restaurants around if you don't mind that sort of thing, and those tend to have their calories listed online. There was a Burger King across the street from my residence, and a Subway and a McDonald's a few minutes' walk away. I'm sure there were more - I just didn't look very hard because I mostly ate supermarket food.\n\nIf you have any more specific questions or scenarios, let me know and I'll see what I can remember!","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

Making my own breakfast bars (I used a base recipe and then am able to adjust this as my tastes change)\n* 3. Make a bag of raw veggies as a snack for each day that week\n* 4. Portion out lunch (usually deli meat, cheese and low-carb wrap)\n* 5. Plan out and make dinners \n\nThen each Monday morning, I bag it all up in a paper bag and bring it to work so I have everything I need for the week.

{"body":"I'm in my 30s. My biggest hurdle that I always have to get over (let's just say weight has been a lifelong issue) is remembering that it's okay to be a little bit hungry. I'm not talking about literal hunger, but sort of psychosomatic hunger.\n\nSo how I overcome a lot of the \"I think I'm hungry\" feelings is trying to make sure that I'm actually hungry before I eat. If I'm not hungry, chances are I'm either bored or feeling depressed (and yes, I have been diagnosed with that, ever since I was a teen), and the third option is that I'm in the middle of an IBS flare, which likes to mimic symptoms of a stomach ulcer, apparently, including hunger after eating. If I'm actually hungry, I find foods that are still within my caloric limit that will be fairly filling. I can't have snack foods around for the most part because I know I can't stop myself. So what do I do? I plan for success. I plan out meals that my husband and I can share, and usually I bulk stuff up with extra vegetables. I only buy what we need, because I'm at a point right now where I'm still too weak to avoid temptation if it's in the house. And to avoid feeling so deprived, I make sure that I build in a dessert of some sort that is still relatively healthy. I can't afford Halo Top, but I know how to make a lot of baked goods healthier. I'm happy to share some of my tips and tricks if you'd like them - this week, we've got a pumpkin cake that's only 103 calories per slice, thanks to some of my tricks!\n\nThe other part is mostly keeping myself occupied. Grad school helps a lot with that, and I don't usually hit the boredom wall too often. If it's depression making me think I need to eat, then unfortunately, I have to fight through it. I can't afford to keep lots of raw, perishable veggies around that might go bad.\n\nBut you can't give up. Sometimes your body's slow on the uptake. Sometimes you hit a plateau. Sometimes, you do everything absolutely right, and your body decides to give you the middle finger anyway. Like yesterday: I ate within my weight-loss range, and most days, that edges the number on the scale down at a comfortable pace, but when I woke up this morning, I'd just maintained. I have to fight that urge to throw it all out the window. But I stepped off the scale, reminded myself that this happens (it did the same thing the last time I lost weight), and just made my coffee and went about my day. Today's another day to keep doing the right things.\n\nJust keep eating the \"good\" calories - you'll feel better for it in the long run. Again, if you want any tips and tricks to build in just enough indulgence to not feel that pang of jealousy or deprivation, let me know. I'm happy to share.","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

{"body":"1. Weight loss! I gained a lot of weight from being in college and overeating/alcohol and decided to take this summer to improve my health and feel better about myself.\n\n\n2. Temporary for weight loss, but the general lifestyle of eating less is something I'd like to be permanent. When I get to my goal weight I'm going to try to keep logging my meals when i stay at maintenance (which is about 1700 cals/day).\n\n\n3. I just started this summer, been logging on MFP for ~75 days. I've lost 12 lbs so far.\u00a0 n\n\n4. Dealing with hunger and cravings for sweets. Also making responsible choices at restaurants and not eating everything on the plate. It was a big change to go from eating whatever willy-nilly to meticulously weighing and logging every single thing I eat and having to turn things down for not being in the budget. But I'm naturally a really organized perfectionist so logging my calories makes me feel more comfortable and feel like I have more control.\n\n\u00a05. Sweets. I work at a frozen yogurt shop so I'm constantly surrounded by sugary toppings that I sometimes graze on. Thankfully this job is temporary so I don't have to worry about such temptations for much longer.\n\n\n6. Not criticism per se, but my parents sometimes treat it as a sort of inconvenience. When going on vacation with my mom she was concerned because I didn't want to splurge. She is also obese so I feel like my own dieting habits make her feel self conscious about her own health. I noticed that around me she tries to make healthier choices, almost as if she's trying to prove to me that she can be healthy too. Yesterday she made a comment to me saying \"you look like you've lost enough weight, you should probably stop.\" Even though I'm only a little more than halfway to my goal.\n\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

This is my take on it, and it's super easy. \n\nHalf cup of Trader Joe's frozen brown rice (don't have to microwave, just put it in there frozen), half a cup of chickpeas, rinsed; 1 cup of TJ's petite green beans (frozen, not cooked), thin sliced radish, diced onion, sliced campari tomato, topped with some alfalfa sprouts. \n\nI also made a dressing for it. I used a couple of tablespoons of tahini, plus a big scoop of TJ's harissa (a spicy pepper paste), some lime juice, a little water, and a tomato whirred together in the food processor. It made enough dressing for six bowls, and I figured out the calories were about 40 per serve of it. \n\nThis one runs me about 350 calories. The basic template for buddha bowls is: bean, green,healthy starch, healthy fat. I can't wait to try more. I'm thinking I may break the typically vegetarian layout of these and add some frozen pre-cooked chicken or a can of tuna to one of them. \n\nRealizing that I didn't need to pre-cook frozen veggies or rice saves a lot of time.

{"body":"Hi! You should check in with /r/fitness for more tips. You're 16 so you're still incredibly young and probably still growing. You're going to need more calories than 1200 in all likelihood. I think the thing about 1200isplenty is it isn't a diet so much as a *lifestyle*. If you're using it to just lose weight then you may have some issues maintaining that weight loss once you hit your peak goal.\n\nAlso - rapid weight loss is often very difficult to maintain (look at biggest loser competitors - they often gain back an enormous amount of weight. Some science people looked at it last year and discovered the rapid weight loss TOTALLY fucked their metabolisms. It was insane). \n\nSo that's one great reason to take it only as quickly as you're comfortable.\n\nYou should chart what you're eating on an average day now. And then think about ways you can start adjusting that diet for the healthier. So if you're eating 2400 calories right now cutting it to 2000. Eating smarter calories so you can feel fuller - things like lots of greens and proteins. Cutting all soda. Period. Changing out, say, high-sugar cereals for, say, oatmeals. \n\nStart adjusting your *lifestyle* so that you're making the kind of changes that are sustainable and healthy. Because if you want to lose fat and keep it off you're going to need to adjust the lifestyle that got you \"fat\" in the first place.\n\nHope you have immense success!","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

Is your dieting preventing you from going out, from eating with friends *ever*, from accepting a slice of cake at someone's birthday, etc? How controlling are you being over your calorie count and food choices?\n\nIf you only ever eat at home, count your calories and refuse to budge... it's not sustainable after a diet, unless you plan to never eat out or have a treat again. So if you're social and out with friends a lot, make sure you're allocating one day a week to eating out with them. It *is* weird if you only drink water every single time they go out to eat. Or maybe, if the situation calls for it, eat a cookie at someone's birthday, or have a donut, and juggle your calories for that day. I know it can be disappointing, when you give up (for example) fruit, peanut butter, crackers, and piece of chocolate for one donut, but I strongly believe in balancing your diet with your life and your social situations. Sometimes you have to make compromises for appropriate behaviours, because you can't always follow your caloric allotment for the day.

You'll need to determine your TDEE and take it from there. It's always a good time to add exercise and what you do know guarantees a better highschool and college experience. I see lots of repeating that highschool sucks and college is better, to not worry if your HS experience isn't like some move where you lose your virginity at prom to some chick who is smoking hot when she takes off her glasses, etc. the general gist is that you need to eat a clean diet, no soda, few processed foods, add some cardio, add some weights, check out r/fitness for suggested weight programs for teens/people just starting out.\n\nThe biggest reason I want you to stay out of this subreddit is because 1200 calories is fine for someone my size, which is about the size of your average 6th grade student. Since you are going to grow to a full adult size, with adult size muscles and all that, this is definitely not the place for you. You know how people who get the gastric bypass end up looking sort of skinny-fat? Like, their skinny, but they aren't toned or muscular?

{"body":"There are several types of people who love to question/ mock/ sabotage anything to do with the healthy lifestyle choices of others. \n\n- 1) \"Your healthy choices make me feel insecure so I overcompensate.\"\n\nThese folks take your lifestyle choices as some sort of judgment on theirs. They feel guilty/ashamed/angry that you are doing what they can't/won't, so they try to bring you down, sabotage or discourage you. \n\nEvery pound you lose rubs it in their face (in their own mind) that they haven't lost any. Every healthy thing you eat, or unhealthy thing you say no to, rubs in their face that their own eating habits aren't good, etc. Of course your choices aren't about them, but they can't typically see that. They may try to talk you into joining in on their unhealthy habits or even be outwardly jealous of you in extreme cases. \n\nDon't get mad at these folks, even if you want to (okay, if they're really being ridiculous, you can tell them off a little...). We all have moments of jealousy, insecurity and doubt that we project onto others. Try to help them in their own goals or, if it obviously will always be an issue, avoid talking about health, weight and food topics. \n\n\n\n- 2) \"I want to keep you in your place.\" \n\nA lot of people love to manipulate others and see life as a \"game\" of dominating other people. Discouraging or sabotaging your weight loss gives them power and in some twisted way makes them feel superior (and let's them put you down when you don't meet your goals). \n\nThese are the folks that will just *have to* give you those coupons to that fast food place you love, or tell you about the last donut in the break room you didn't ask about (but then have some probably-passive-aggressive comment once you eat that \"bad\" food).\n\nTheir tactics are insidious and they get a sick joy out of seeing you fail - I work with one of these people and she does this **non-stop** to a morbidly obese coworker who is trying to lose, then shames her when she fails. These people tend to be crappy people in general. If it isn't your weight/fitness, they'll find some other issue to start a problem with. Deal with them as you see fit - a snappy comeback is always helpful but the best feeling is seeing them sputter when their behavior doesn't work and doesn't get to you.\n\n- 3) \"I'm really concerned...but I don't actually know much about nutrition.\"\n\nThis is a *lot* of people. They know zilch about what calorie or fat intakes should be, what is really a healthy weight, what is and isn't nutrient-dense food versus junk food, etc. They usually mean well but just don't have the knowledge to back up their opinions and may have cultural bias against certain healthy behaviors (for instance, we all know the stereotypical Polish/Italian/etc. grandma who thinks everyone is too thin and tries to feed you starch and meat constantly). You can usually politely educate these folks and once they see you aren't turning into a skeleton, they'll back off.\n\n**TL;DR** - Some people are jealous, some are insecure, some are misinformed and some are downright nasty and just love to mess with others.

{"body":"Have you tried Intermittent Fasting?  You only allow yourself certain hours to eat, usually at least 16 hours of fasting and an 8 hour eating window, but there are a lot of variations.  One variation, the warrior diet, is basically that you eat nothing or very little for breakfast and lunch and then eat all your calories at dinner.  This was helpful to me, since I know I can have just about anything I want (up to 1200 cals) for dinner, I am able to go the whole day without eating.  Honestly I am only hungry for a few hours in the morning and it's easy to ignore if you're busy.  \n\nIF is not for everyone, but you might want to look into it.  It might be bad for you and encourage eating disordered behavior (if so stop immediately), but for me it helped stop the late binges because I never felt deprived.  I would think throughout the day, 'what do I really want to eat tonight?' and if it was a burger, fries and glass of wine, I would do it.  I didn't feel deprived.  Honestly most of my meals were pretty healthy and I started having a small healthy snack at 2pm to reach the 1200.\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

As for peer-reviewed articles and such, I was not looking for a debate or trying to throw things in your face, so I am not going to go there.

How we navigate through life and circumstances = survival.

{"body":"I'm on day 12 of the Whole30 eating plan. Yesterday was absolutely the hardest day for me. I was really exhausted due to other things going on in my life and crazy lack of sleep, and I was feeling really nauseous. All I wanted was a big slice of pizza, and I was *this* close to losing all my good momentum.\n\n\nThen I found this recipe! I happened to have everything in my fridge (for the burgers, guac, and fries!) and it totally made me forget about the pizza I had been dreaming of an hour before. It saved me from going hungry or ruining my progress, plus SO was really happy with it as well. \n\n\nSince I hadn't eaten much all day, I made a good amount of guac to pile onto the burger, so my dinner came out to 532 calories. I put all the ingredients into MyFitnessPal, though, and without the guac it would have just been 340 for the burger (wrapped in lettuce) and fries which were both delicious on their own. \n\n\nI followed the recipe for the burgers almost exactly (minus the paprika) - 193 cal per burger (made 4 burgers).\n\n\nThe guac was really simple - 3 avacadoes, 1/4 red onion, juice of half a lime - 192 cal per serving (it made 4 servings).\n\n\nI also followed the recipe for the fries, only I used sweet potatoes instead of squash. Three relatively small sweet potatoes (small like... 3/4 of the size I usually find at the grocery store. I'd use just 2 regular size potatoes for the same amount) to make 4 servings - 147 cal per serving. ","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

{"body":"To each their own, but I genuinely am rarely able to tell the difference between a full-fat ice cream and the light or frozen yogurt version. Over the summer, I switched between both often, and I really didn't detect many differences, at least with a Haagen-Dasz and the store's frozen yogurt. Just comparing like to like, looking at the Haagen-Dasz vanilla ice cream flavor, it's 270 calories. My store brand's vanilla light ice cream is 120 calories, making it 150 calories easier to budget for it if I want it, still leaving room for a snack in the middle of the day. I can't attest to the flavor of Halo Top, but I can tell you that the lower calorie count of my ice cream, at least, is a big draw. It's just a massive bonus that it still tastes like the ice cream I remember.\n\nI mean, you can definitely have Haagen-Dasz if you want - you certainly don't have to sacrifice taste on a diet, and if anything, I'd say the occasional indulgence helps you stick with it. It's more a matter of making sure that you take the nutritional \"damage\" so to speak into account before you do so, or don't beat yourself up afterward if you go over. I just think that for some people right now, Halo Top or light ice cream are their limit to indulge without too much \"damage,\" and I'd hazard a guess that most of the consumers aren't going overboard, like the woman in the CR article fears.

Or you can switch to two soylent meals a day and eat one more filling meal (which you can even batch-cook in advance to reduce stress - make a week's worth of the same meal in one go, divide it into seven containers, and just reheat one every day).\n\n* If you're not hungry, but bored, why not add in a few low-calorie snacks that aren't soylent? You can buy prepackaged ones in stores to remove the stress of having to prepare them (like individual pieces of fresh fruit, \"snack packs\" of pre-cut fruit or vegetables, those 100-calorie packs of cookies or crackers, granola bars, snack-sized chocolate bars, fruit/nut/seed \"shots,\" or iced treats like sorbet or mini popsicles).\n\n* If you're having trouble losing weight on that regimen (which I strongly doubt, as that's a pretty big deficit), *don't* go any lower without consulting a professional - it could be dangerous.

{"body":"Ah, here it is (sorry for the wall of text - I can't format the quote properly. Their wiki has it all nicely done, if it's easy for you to navigate there. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to post a link):\n\n&gt;I've been losing weight successfully, but I hit a Plateau! Why is this happening, and what can I do to get through it?\nIf your plateau has lasted for a month or more\n\n&gt;The first thing to check is that you are restricting your intake sufficiently to lose body fat. You are either underestimating how many calories you are eating, or overestimating how many calories you burn.\n\n&gt;Make sure that you set a calorie goal that is less than your TDEE. If you use a logging app, make sure that your calorie goal has been updated to use your most recent weight. Verify that your app is close to this calculator.\n&gt;Ensure that you are tracking your calories. Are you logging everything you eat?\n&gt;Ensure that you are tracking portions correctly. It is helpful to use a food scale and/or measuring cups at least when you are getting started to get a better sense for portions, especially with calorie dense foods like peanut butter, nuts, or oils.\n&gt;If you are tracking exercise calories, keep in mind that it is easy to overestimate.\n\n\n&gt;If your plateau has lasted for less than a month\n\n&gt;It is likely that you are losing fat, but water retention after eating more than usual or other factors are keeping your weight fairly steady. This is very common since there are many factors that affect your weight other than body fat.\n\n&gt;It is not unusual to see a \"whoosh\" of weight loss after a few weeks of no change in weight\n&gt;If you have started or made changes to your exercise routine, especially adding weight training, it is very common for your muscles to retain additional water, which will temporarily increase your scale weight for as long as 3 weeks\n&gt;Weigh yourself daily at the same time (right when you wake up is best), and use an app such as HappyScale to keep a moving average. This will give you a much more accurate picture than weighting weekly or monthly, where one bad day can have a huge impact on your perceived weight.\n&gt;It is a good idea to have goals other than your scale weight to make sure you don't get discouraged by plateaus. \n\n&gt;For example:\n\n&gt;waist or other body measurements\n\n&gt;body fat percentage (especially if you are doing weight training) using the caliper test or measurements\n\n&gt;progress pictures (just go on facebook and look at pictures from a month ago and before you started)\n\n\n&gt;Additionally, it is a good idea to have goals that are related to your plan, not the results, since these will be 100% in your control:\n\n&gt;committing to tracking every day\n\n&gt;improving a food habit (e.g. replacing a bag of chips with some baby carrots and a cheese stick)\n\n&gt;consistantly meeting your step goal\n\n&gt;As long as you don't get discouraged, the weight WILL come off.","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

Added a little bit of Greek yogurt for tang, nutritional yeast to give it a slightly cheesier taste (and a Vitamin B12 kick), salt, and pepper. Tasted, and if I felt it was too thick, I thinned it out with some flax milk (allergic to almonds), and if it needed seasoning, I added it. I still made mine on the thick side, rather than thinned out - I wanted it to stick to the pasta. It's not vegan because of the yogurt, but I'm sure there are plain vegan yogurts that would work just fine in its place.\n\nSmitten Kitchen's pesto was made with raw cauliflower, pine nuts or almonds, olive oil, parmesan, dry-packed sundried tomatoes, and parsley, plus salt and pepper, I think, so I deviated a lot, haha.\n\nI also bulked up the dish a bit with some sauteed summer squash and 8 ounces of fresh mushrooms, sliced.\n\nAnother recipe that isn't pesto, but it's still a pretty good cauliflower sauce is Oh She Glows's [cauli-power vegan alfredo sauce](http://ohsheglows.com/2014/01/20/cauli-power-fettuccine-alfredo-vegan/). It's what finally convinced me to buy a shaker of nutritional yeast to try. I don't always substitute nutritional yeast for Parmesan, but the results are rarely bad when I do.\n\nWith a pound of pasta (plus the squash and mushrooms), my pesto makes six servings for 312 calories, including the pasta.

{"body":"&gt; For your PA though, if she's tracking your weight over a series of appointments she shouldn't be surprised that you are limiting calories because the weight reduction would show that.\n\nYou'd think, right? I guess what bothers me the most, other than being talked to like an evil junkfood addict because my PA ignores my 30+ pounds of weight loss, is being told a health issue I had *before* I was in an overweight BMI range is \"from eating bad and being fat.\" I had to practically give her a sermon about my diet and exercise habits - and insist on seeing a GI doctor who ran more sophisticated tests that indeed showed I had a real problem - before she would take anything I had to say seriously. I can't imagine what people go through who are on the higher end of obese or morbidly obese to get their health concerns actually listened to. \n\nWe have Wegmans here (which is a not-very-expensive-but-still-bougie grocery chain) and a variety of local grocers and cafes that have a lot of vegan items. Since I've been eating little to no dairy for health issues, it's really amazed me how much vegan stuff is out there that is absolutely garbage (delicious, delicious garbage). \n\nI've read most people lose a *lot* of weight upon going vegan, but I think some of this is lack of availability (as in your case) or being a fussy eater. I have vegan friends who hate vegetables, lentils, tofu, etc. There are like ten foods they eat and a lot of it is horribly processed and loaded with artificial stuff.

{"body":"I LOVE sushi. Here are some tips, but they may only apply if you're American or Canadian.  \n\nI always begin with a cup of miso soup.  Very low calorie (under 50 usually) and having different types of food in one meal (hot and wet vs. cold and chewy) helps me feel more satisfied. Sometimes my husband and I will share an order of edamame as well. These are also pretty low calorie and filling, just watch your portion sizes.  They also take a longer time to eat so it helps slow you down. \n\nOnto the rolls!  In American sushi restaurants, there are usually two sections of maki (sushi rolls) on the menu.  The basic ones are cheaper and smaller and usually have 1-2 ingredients.  These are your best bet. Then you have the specialty rolls, which are more elaborate, often have several ingredients, and are usually topped off with more fish, avocados, tobiko, and/or sauces.  We stick to ordering a few basic rolls and maybe 1 or 2 speciality, but he eats more of the larger rolls than I do. Skip anything deep fried.  Not only are those higher calorie, but they're kind of gross in my opinion.  Frying makes the seaweed taste really fishy to me.  \n\nAnything that says \"spicy\" has spicy mayo, which will increase the calories.  Anything that says \"tempura\" means that ingredient has been fried.  \"Crunchy\" means that it contains bits of fried tempura batter.  All of this is ok in moderation, but try not to have these things in everything on your plate.\n\nThe biggest thing to keep in mind is that restaurants vary widely in terms of size of rolls.  Spicy tuna maki is my absolute favorite.  The restaurant we go to makes them very small, so although I know they're higher calorie than a regular tuna roll, I don't feel so bad about indulging.  Think maybe an inch or so in diameter.  I've been to a restaurant near a major university that only had specialty rolls, and they were about 3\" in diameter.  Nothing on that menu was a good choice unless you shared a single roll between two people (which we did!). \n\nRemember: the best way to enjoy sushi is with friends.  Order several rolls and try some of each.  \n\nTLDR: have a low calorie appetizer, stick to the basic maki rolls that are small in diameter, and keep crunchy, spicy, and tempura to a minimum.  And share!","subreddit_id":"t5_2xk5e","subreddit":"1200isplenty"}

I don't particularly enjoy measuring and weighing all my food, so it's sort of a treat to not do it occassionally. \n\n\nThat said, starvation mode isn't a thing. Your metabolism can change slightly (and remember rmr and bmr calculators are for the average person, and not everyone is average. Your body composition greatly affects your metabolism. People with prader-willi syndrome have very low muscle tone and their caloric requirements can be half of what would be expected of a similar healthy person), but the idea that you'll entirely stop losing weight by eating too few calories is wrong. People starve. If starvation mode were true, they wouldn't. \n\n\nThat said, you can eat too few calories to lose weight as effectively as you could. Lets say your rmr is 2500 calories per day.

When you feel quiet inside, you can allow yourself small, portion controlled snacks.\n\nYou can get a lot of mileage out of roasted seaweed for low carbs and calories. I like Trader Joe's Wasabi flavor, because the spiciness slows me down.  An entire package is 60 calories and no net carbs.\n\nYou might also try replacing your coffee and soda (which can be agitating) with something calming, like green tea or holy basil (tulsi) tea, which have calming properties.\n\nAdditionally, with any snacks you are already eating, make them as spicy as you can handle and garnish with fresh herbs, green onions, vinegars, mustards, etc.  This will help slow you down and appreciate your snack, and feel fancier and less deprived about it.

{"body":"My favorite bulking veggies are cabbage, spinach, and lettuce.  Lettuce I use mainly for salads. Spinach also for salads, but can be cooked up and used in egg casseroles too. Cabbage, though, has become my go to veggie for making anything. Most recently used stir fried, thin sliced cabbage as a noodle replacement under a delicious chicken/broccoli/alfredo sauce. It was delicious. I also use it in a lot of stir fries and other casserole type dishes.\n\nHere is one example: \n\nChicken Broccoli Asian Stir Fry\n\n3lbs chicken\n\n~4 cup frozen broccoli\n\n10ish eggs\n\n~30oz cabbage\n\nGet a big, deep pan.. I usually use my largest dutch oven or a giant stir fry pan I have. Put some oil in the bottom.. here I use bacon grease and/or some sesame oil.  Cube chicken into pan, fry until chicken is cooked through. Slice up cabbage ( I do this by quartering it, coring it, then thin slicing it to get noodle like pieces, but really any size will be fine). Add to pan with chicken and mix it in. Continue turning cabbage under so that it starts to look translucent and get soft. Add bag of broccoli (Costco broccoli has quite large florets, so I usually spend a few minutes smashing the bag - still frozen -  with a rolling pin to break them up) and stir into the chicken and cabbage mixture. I do this all over high heat on the stove, to cook off some of the water that gets into the bottom.  \n\nWhile the cabbage mixture is cooking, spray a separate frying pan with cooking oil and crack the 10 eggs into it. Scramble with a fork and cook.  Takes a few minutes to thoroughly cook over high heat, so keep them moving in the pan to keep them loose and scrambled. When the eggs are done, dump the whole pan into the cabbage mixture. Use your spoon or spatula or whatever you are stirring with to break up the scrambled eggs and incorporate them into the rest of the mixture.  Now, add lots of soy sauce and other spices you might like to compliment the \"asian\" flavor. I have also served this with crushed peanuts and/or carrot shreds mixed in.\n\nMade as above, I got 9 servings out of it.. 278 calories, 10g fat, 41g protein, 9 carbs, 4 fiber, 5 net carbs per serving.

Or sub venison for the turkey if you have it available.\n\n- About a quarter-cup's worth of streaky bacon, chopped up small.  Or lardons if you have those instead.\n\n- One small finely-diced onion, one clove of minced garlic.  Or if you can't eat those, a stalk of minced celery instead.\n\n- A teaspoon each of ground pepper and salt.\n\n- A quarter-to-half teaspoon each of dried spices:  clove, nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice, thyme, and sage.

Drizzle your maple syrup thinly over the filling once it's packed in.\n\nMake a bowl of mashed cauliflower, or get crazy and do a mix of mashed cauliflower and carrot, then let it cool slightly.  Blend in one beaten egg and spread it like thick frosting to cover all the filling.  Grind pepper over.

{"body":"Welcome!\n\nOk, so you may not know this so ignore me if you do right?\n\nBut all weight loss is based on the calories in calories out principle - that by eating at a deficit your body will burn it's excess fat and you will lose weight.\n\nSo - keto helps by keeping you full on less, makes you burn fat more efficiently, is muscle sparing - all those good things... but at its root it is CICO, still.\n\nYour overall macro balance is based on two things:\n\n* overall calorie consumpsion - based on your total daily calorie expenditure (TDEE), which varies based on gender, height, activity level\n* your muscle mass\n\nIn short the bigger you are and the more muscle you have the more you need to eat to maintain your current weight.\n\nYour protein macro is also higher when you have more muscle mass to sustain.\n\n---\n\nWhere does this leave you?\n\nWhen you're losing it's a general rule of thumb to recalculate your macros every 10lbs lost or so (or stone, depending on your side of the pond).  This is because as you lose weight your TDEE will change - before you'd needed to eat 1600 calories to maintain and your deficit meant you were burning 400 cals of fat - but as you lost weight your TDEE is now 1500, say, so your only burning 300 cals on the same deficit. \n\nThis is often why people think they've stalled because \"what they were doing has stopped working\" where in fact the opposite is true - they did it and their body adjusted and they need to recalculate accordingly!\n\n---\n\n**TLDR**: My advice to you would be this:\n\n* have you lost 10 - 14lbs since your last macro check?\n* have you been working out a lot or lost a lot of inches (ie body fat)\n\nIf the answer to either of those is 'yes' then recalculate, if not... kepp going! :D","subreddit_id":"t5_37vp3","subreddit":"1200isplentyketo"}

Also, it's a good idea to always keep like a gallon at least of cheap tasteless white high-proof vinegar on hand for everything.  One, it can be used in cleaning things or adding a couple drops when you wash questionable produce.  Two, PICKLES!\n\nWe love pickles.  Low-cal, loads of flavour.\n\nSugarfree quick pickles are a great way of using up produce which is about to go off and you want to extend their existence a couple more weeks.  If you have a fridge, keep them in the fridge.  If you're stranded in a blizzard, park the jars in the coldest part of your house/garage once they've cooled to whatever your current ambient temperature might be.  To make, what you do is chop up your veg and pack real tight into jars, putting in some sprigs of whatever herbs you have which also need to get used up.  Dill, thyme, rosemary, maybe bay leaves.  Always cracked pepper, and mustard seeds if you have them.  Then make your pickling liquid (brine) in a pot on your stovetop and/or the alcohol stove you've made from a beer can:\n\n- one tablespoon salt\n\n- one cup plain white vinegar\n\n- 1/4th cup's worth of your artificial sweetener\n\nBring to a boil, then pour over the raw veg in the jars and put lids on while still hot.  Let cool, then put into the cold... these are not long-term preservation pickles so they can't be kept at room temperature or last forever, but it's a good way of extending produce if you aren't sure when you can go find more.  This is a proportion-based thing and can be scaled up to deal with however many veggies and jars you have on hand.  It works for hard/firm things like carrots, bellpeppers, cucumbers, button mushrooms, and probably anything else you have which is fresh or lightly blanched which you could safely eat raw too.  As for calories/carbs, you count them the same as if they're raw because the pickling brine is essentially negligible when you use artificial sweeteners rather than real sugar like your usual bread-and-butter pickles do.","subreddit_id":"t5_37vp3","subreddit":"1200isplentyketo"}

{"body":"Post-Induction Stall Syndrome. I'ts a really sort of ironically unfortunate acronymn because it refers to water weight and stalls.\n\nHere's the summary:\n\n* you stop eating carbs. You increase your water intake. Carbs tend to promote water retention - so by not eating these and increasing your water intake you lose lots of water very fast - aka \"*I lost 10lbs in my first week but it was just water weight*\"\n* when you take a scale reading you're not just measuring the bad stuff (fat) but also muscle, bone and water. \n* so, ideally you want the number on the scale to go down because you're losing fat, but water fluctuations can mask this on a daily basis - especially during skark week for women\n* PISS is the montherlode of this\n* Imagine you're holding a bunch of apples (water) and oranges (fat). You like apples, but hate oranges - and the first week of keto makes you drop *everything* you're holding because it's all mixed together. You then spend the next week or too diligently picking up the pples you dropped\n* Essentially your body takes *back in* the water it's lost in that first week, very slowly over the next several weeks.\n\nSo, the post induction stall is what's going on with your scale while this is happening. \n\nWeek | Weight | Water |  Fat\n---|---|----|----\n1 | 250 lbs | --- |  --- \n2 | 240 lbs | -8 lbs | -2 lbs\n3 | 235 lbs | -4 lbs | -1 lbs\n... | ... | ... | ...\n6 | 235 lbs | +2 lbs | -2 lbs \n7 | 235 lbs | +1 lbs | -1 lbs\n8 | 235 lbs | +2 lbs | -2 lbs\n\netc\n\nso can you see you are still losing fat but the water weight regain is masking it? After it's reached the amount you lost in the first weeks the stall should end and you'll start losing again :)\n","subreddit_id":"t5_37vp3","subreddit":"1200isplentyketo"}

A nice nutty taste to the bread when it's fried in butter.\n* That nutty taste when fried also makes them excellent for dessert nachos, just fry up and add some cinnamon and Stevia.\n* Smaller squares for bite sized items, such as Lavash bread, a quarter of a slice of cheese, a slice of Roma tomato, topped with egg salad or tuna salad or whatever.\n* Easier to create a wrap because it rolls up without having to \"tuck in\" the ends of the tortilla. Just roll up.\n\nVery versatile.","subreddit_id":"t5_37vp3","subreddit":"1200isplentyketo"}

{"body":"To continue, because I'm at home alone and going slowly insane, and since nobody else is reading this post then I can ramble at will...\n\nThe issue of preservation.  There's an order to what you stock and what you consume.  You need to know the shelf-life of what you have, and plan for a total power loss, and then use up your supplies in the order which takes into consideration when they're gonna go bad.  Much of this depends on the external conditions of your crisis.  A blizzard is actually a pretty good thing since it means you all of a sudden have all the deep-freeze capacity you need just by wrapping things in trash bags and burying them in the snowbank outside.  An earthquake in the middle of summer is much worse, because anything frozen you've stored is useless very fast.  The advantage to middle of summer, at least, is that you can hike out and engage in fistfights over toilet paper at the Walgreens two miles distant, while in winter that isn't a good idea.\n\nMy worst winter was the one where me, two kids, and several small animals were in a blizzard which was collapsing roofs and while I was pretty sure our house would stand there was no way in hell we were going to get even my 4wd down the track and into civilization for a while.  Our power went out, of course.  Then the gas line froze, then the water mains exploded and I had to dig out the access to shut off the broken pipe with the long key in the middle of the night.  Couldn't feel my hands, feet, face by the time I got back inside to where my five-year-old was holding my toddler back from following.  That one sucked.\n\nWhat you do is, you set up a tent inside the house because it helps contain your body heat.  You put every pillow and blanket you own inside as insulation, add in your small animals in kennels or travel cages, and you coax the offspring into staying in there with games and whatever was supposed to be their Christmas presents delivered early as long as they stay in the tent.  Food preservation at this point is the easy thing, because your fridge is a freezer now if you crack open the door and all you have to do is worry about repackaging anything which is going to explode frozen.  My son's hermit crab didn't make it, unfortunately.  We'd built a firepit the summer prior and had fuel available (hell, if you have furniture then you have fuel available!), so you can cook outside.  Preferably in ways which permit you to keep your hands mostly inside the bulk of every sweater, coat, and bathrobe you own.\n\nThe problem with emergency situations is that carb-heavy things are so often the easiest to simply preserve.  Everyone's got a bag of flour, right?  Rice, flour, grains, sugar, potatoes, dried beans, these are staples precisely because they last a very long time in non-modernized conditions.  So you have to look instead at the old-fashioned ways people preserved other foods (drying or pickling or smoking meat, making sausage and bacon, pickling or salting eggs, turning milk into hard cheese, drying or pickling vegetables/fruits).  Canning, dehydrating and jarring foods was a huge leap forward in keeping foods available without refrigeration and continues to be something to take advantage of today; many people don't even know that if you look through the center aisles of the grocery store you can find pretty much the same stuff you find fresh in cans or jars or powdered form.\n\nIt's not gonna taste the same as fresh, obviously, which is why dried herbs and spices and pepper are important.  Also salt, which is a preservative in its own right as well as making bland crap palatable.  And your cooking methods will change to either fast cooking in a hot-fire pan or slowcooking in tinfoil or a dutch oven buried in whatever coals you can keep successfully banked.\n\nBonus points:  Rock stew.\n\nTake your dutch oven (or your heaviest pot with a nonmelting lid) and fill it with everything, literally everything, which isn't going to survive past tomorrow.  Leftover meat, wilted vegetables, soft apples, hard sausage, beef jerky, the rinds of hard cheese (wax removed).  Put in bouquet garni herbs (thyme, rosemary, bay leaf, tarragon, parsley, basil, whatsoever) and grind in a good amount of black or mixed pepper.  Add a couple tablespoons of both mustard and tomato paste, and a couple tablespoons of soy sauce, and a tablespoon of red wine vinegar.  Just-past-fresh tomatoes if you have them are a great addition too.  Add a can of kidney, red, or black beans.  Make sure there's at least a carrot and a stalk of celery.  Add a bottle of beer or whichever half-spoiled wine you have leftover, or water if you're desperately out of those, to just reach the top of the ingredients, then stir to be sure everything's mixed.  Maybe wrap the top around with tinfoil if you don't trust your lid's airtight integrity.  Settle this into the coals of your fire (you have to have thick leather gloves and a couple pairs of heavy fireplace tongs here) and leave it for hours while the fire gradually dies.  Eventually, rock stew.","subreddit_id":"t5_37vp3","subreddit":"1200isplentyketo"}

Have you been able to pinpoint exactly which qualities in snacks it is that's giving you the emotional relaxation?  Since cheese, eggs, pork rinds have both salt and fat in common but not texture in common I'd guess you're programmed to look for something salty-and-fatty.  Rather than drinking sweetened things like soda and (maybe sweetened?) coffee, have you considered drinking something which is salty/fatty-seeming instead?  Cubes of chicken or beef bouillon in hot water, cans of tomato soup or heated-up V8?  Those have a whole lot fewer calories than cheese and sour cream while still getting in the not-sweet, salty, viscous feel.

{"body":"Jennifer didn't just have a single vial, she had twelves cases of vials. They are seen being loaded on the plane in the season 1 finale and burnt in 202. She was planning to take a tour, stopping at twelve major cities around the world. As three months elapsed between the finale and premiere (in 2015/6 time), Jennifer must have been having major doubts to have not yet released any of the virus. \n\nIn the season 1 finale, Olivia made a comment about how the distribution of the virus was out of their hands. It seems odd that they would trust such an important part of their plan to someone like Jennifer, however much of the 12 Monkeys plans seems to be based on the Word of the Witness. Perhaps in a previous timeline, Jennifer actually went through with releasing the virus. She would make a good scapegoat as she was CEO of the company that manufactured the Kalavirus (Markridge) and had a history of mental illness. It seemed like there was a good chance that Jennifer would have released the virus if not for Cole's intervention, especially as Olivia had sent her henchman to ensure it's release. \n\nAlso recall that there was a massive gathering of people on the street for the Chinese New Year celebration. I don't think we ever saw what was below where Jennifer was threatening to drop the vial, but if it was the street we saw in the previous scene, dozens of people could have been infected immediately. I believe it was also in New York, so with their high population density, one of those infected people gets on a crowded subway and the spread would probably be rapid and unstoppable.\n\nETA: It didn't seem like Jennifer's actual plan was to go to a roof and drop the virus, as she was in the middle of the street crowd when Cole spotted her and gave chase. Jennifer had a background in virology and worked in the Markridge lab, so likely would have known the best way to disseminate the virus for maximum effect.\n","subreddit_id":"t5_31827","subreddit":"12Monkeys"}

{"body":"As always this is speculation, but my take is that the tea does allow one's consciousness to \"drift within the time stream\", if you will. Note I say drifting and not sailing or swimming (to keep with the stream analogy). This would mean you can visit other times or even places outside of time (the Cedar and Pine House), but not in a deliberate way nor in a desired direction. \n\nI think only certain people have the power or ability to actually control what they do while in the time stream. We know Cole can do it, of course. I believe this is due to the blood injections. There could also be other factors, but that's the most obvious one so far. We'll probably get more insight into this when we learn more about Cole's mom, who as we know had \"delusions\" about an Army of the 12 Monkeys who was after her kid.\n\nWe can assume Witness can do it as well. I'd go as far as saying the time stream is actually where the Witness lives, detached from the physical reality. Him being the son of two travelers, one of them being Cole no less, some genetic element probably comes into play. \n\nI also suspect Jennifer can do it, as we can see her guiding Jones while they tripped together (as opposed to Cassie's \"guided meditation\" at the hands of Olivia where Olivia was only leading her from the outside without also being present in that realm). \n\nHowever, unlike Jennifer, Cole can manipulate events from the time stream and not only choose when to visit. Arguably, Big W can also manipulate events, but only when he can get a hold of a host, like when he possessed Cassie, since again he doesn't exist in the physical world.","subreddit_id":"t5_31827","subreddit":"12Monkeys"}
{"body":"Did Ramse's kid get taken or was that a malfunction in the machine? For some reason Ramse, his child, Olivia, and other revolters against the Ao12M are in this space that seems to be outside of time somewhere. No doubt Ramse's son served a purpose through out the series but I was talking about the people who died in Titan in Blood Washed Away. They were important to Cole, so, in order to get Cole there, the Witness had to kill them so Cole and Cassie would come back to save them. That delivered Cassie to the Ao12M thus giving them the Witness. \n\nAs for the tether, the technology that Katarina has, she can detect a tether. As for the Witness tether and technology, it's unexplored in the show. In Immortal you see the Witness in the form of Aaron Marker appear to Cassie, then he injected her with something. Before that you see his eyes turn black. Once he injected her with whatever he injected her with, her eyes turns black. At that point, when he tethered to the facility, he was in her. That would suggest he could tether his conciousness to other people if they are injected with whatever he injected Cassie with. Once that was done, Katarina gave her some type of injection so the Witness wasn't able to take control of her anymore. It must of been his injection.","subreddit_id":"t5_31827","subreddit":"12Monkeys"}

{"body":"I think the Witness capabilities to time travel and his presence is way different than what we have seen Cole do. We know the Witness was born outside of time by two time travelers who have taken Katarina's serum, while we don't know how different he is, we do know from what Pallid man said concerning him, that he's far more 'special' than himself, Cassie, or Cole. The specifics on that will be in season 3 I think. From what we see in 'Immortal', he wasn't physically present to Cassie, he was present mentally. From there he enjected her with something that allowed him to possess her. Katarina said there was a tether that was in the facility, I think that allowed him to be present in her and him being able to possess her. It may have something to do with his makeup being born outside of time, the injection he gave Cassie, and his technology that was given to him by Katarina's ex-husband that makes him capable of doing these things. From all of that, I think it was the Witness in her all along. \n\nAlso, the primary of 59' in the asylum, I believe, she named off her family and I believe her family members were not members of the Ao12M. She didn't want her family to continue their legacy of having children in a future that was damned with destruction, so she killed them. We see how the Witness used Cole's friends against him to bait him to getting Cassie to Titan to further securing his future, in the same way the Witness could use her family against her. If not that, she probably didn't want to see them corrupted by the future or destroyed in the plague. But she is primary, the Witness has a keen interest in primaries, who knows what he would have done to her through family. But this is just my thoughts on what has happened so far.","subreddit_id":"t5_31827","subreddit":"12Monkeys"}

{"body":"I used to collect cheap paperbacks of Peanuts comics as a kid, and of course I watched as many of the TV specials as I could.  Peanuts was sort of everywhere back then, late 70s/early 80s.  \n\nI have no sense of where Peanuts sits in the cultural landscape these days.  There obviously was last year's big Peanuts Movie (which I enjoyed/thought was fun, overall), and I still see Snoopy stuff all over the place, but there's also a part of me which thinks it's destined for a kind of fade-out/cultural irrelevance soon-ish.  It feels like a natural thing to happen, for a strip whose acknowledged heyday was in the 60s and 70s, which still was pretty dominant in the 80s and whose creator died at the beginning of this century...\n\nI mean, we're closing in fast on the 20 year anniversary of Schulz's death, it'll be here before we know it.  We're hitting a point where stuff that used to be the dominant culture becomes older than 1940s big band music was when I was born.  Everything goes away, and the really huge stuff finds a way to keep itself in the culture, off at the sides, like how Louis Armstrong music is still present, still something people listen to and discover anew, but it's off at the sides, where interesting older things lurk.  \n\nI feel like I'm a little bit out of touch with really recent graphic novel developments-- I left my bookstore job over a year ago and have kind of fallen away from noticing really new stuff, although I really liked Dan Clowes' most recent book, PATIENCE.  I found it really gripping and surprising.

{"body":"I can see your points... but I have to argue that the whole boiling down to 3 or 4 templates really is a problem with money grubbing. RTS in general for a long time has been basically those templates, correct? You have base defense missions, destroy a base missions, build a base missions and you have random escort missions. That has formed the backbone of RTS campaigns for eons. If anything, I think Blizzard is guilty of no innovation here, which would definitely be true. I wonder if an RTS could actually truly innovate along those lines though... with the genre being modeled after real war, how many battles can you not categorize as one of those four things?","subreddit_id":"t5_3bimc","subreddit":"12in12"}

This allows them to help stop the run while limiting the passing game.  \n\nIf the QB can read it quickly enough, then he can throw to the size with the zone and make some yards.  If he can't, he gets sacked.\n\nInside the 20s, things change and you see them lock down the receivers a lot more, as they try to keep everything out of the end zone. \n\nWith a little luck, or a slow-reading QB, the defense will shut down the O and we'll get off the field, but Arky showed that a good QB that can take some shots will move the chains a lot.

{"body":"First of all: thank you for putting this together. My take:\n\nTrevor's pocket presence is worrisome. There are so many times in those gifs where the offensive line does a fantastic job blocking a very talented D-Line, and rather than step up into the pocket created for him Trevor back pedals and makes an off balance or inaccurate throw. Teams like Bama, Ole Miss, and Auburn are really going to make us pay if that continues. \n\nIn watching those gifs it looks like his inaccuracy stems from his uncomfortableness with pressure and stepping up into the pocket. This needs to change.   \n\nWhat worries me even more is often times you cannot teach a player to learn how to handle pocket pressure. They just have it or don't. Trevor is a red shirt senior. If he hasn't developed those skills now I am worried they are just never coming. \n\nNevertheless, it was his first game of real football in over a year against a top 20 team at a new stadium. This could have played a roll in his deficiencies. \n\nOverall he played well, didn't commit costly turnovers, and didn't hand them the game. That being said, he needs to improve his accuracy, his pocket presence, and his decision when to pass or tuck the ball and run. I would also like Noel to run more designed runs to get his confidence up and give the defense something else to scheme against to open up the passing game / help with pressure.

{"body":"Okay, the roll-block is kind of a mixed bag.  It *is* a good block, with some reservations. \n\nThe Good:\n\nThis is meant for a quick pass, and it does well if the ball is thrown immediately or run the other direction immediately.\n\nIt blocks a wide area.  Instead of the width of your shoulders/arms, you can kind-of block from your butt to your head.\n\nThe defender has to put their arms down, as there is a body rolling into their legs.  This is *very* good for making passing lanes.\n\nIt is a bit easier on the OL, as they don't have to  find the defender and get their hands in the body or risk a flat-out miss.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nIt looks stupid.\n\nIf the play takes any time at all, the defender will get up and have a free shot. \n\nIf the defender sees it coming, they can jump the OL, or go around him for a free shot. \n\nAfter making the block, the OL is out of position for stopping anything else. He's (almost) literally like a turtle on his back. Especially if the QB has to scramble. \n\nOverall:\n\nIt is a good move, and I'm actually happy to see it being used, but I'm glad I only saw it a few times on one side and only once on the other. \n\nIt will give teams more to prepare for, while giving us more options to use around it.

{"body":"HOLY RAZORBACK GOGGLES BATMAN... kinda\n\n&gt;Hall may be a little more versatile against the run, while Garrett almost always goes wide. Running right at him (behind Dan Skipper) is probably the best strategy: he\u2019s already not a great run defender (in his defense, teams often run away from him), and it will wear him out faster.\n\nI think that may be an understatement now. Purely eye test here and no advanced stats to back it up but couple the fact that our d line is regularly rotated based on packages and down and distance, this hasn't really been an issue outside fo the first quarter against Auburn. I feel like thats based heavily on first year Myles and early second year but beware of that freak's ability to read the play from the snap. Dae Dae too although you are correct in how they play off the line: Dae Dae finesses to the inside gap way more often. I think thats because he has the agility but the not speed to beat the tackle to the corner every time like Myles.\n\nI'd also be wary of our running attack which you deemed as a non-threat and gave Ford a not so favorable look. Understand that Ford excels in his role as being a punisher. Yeah he wont be there busting off fancy, ankle-breaking runs like Trayveon, but he does his job and he does it well: punishing the dline and LBs with A/B gap runs. This allows Trayveon to clean up in key moments late in the game when the opposing front seven is gassed.\n\nOverall, decent write up and definitely pretty moderate with the bias considering our own blogs and those of more aggressive offenders around the SEC (and big12 [11] cough cough). \n\nGood luck and no injuries tomorrow!","subreddit_id":"t5_2wjlu","subreddit":"12thMan"}

{"body":"I loved Shaan Washington this game. Played very hard despite the opponent, batting down passes and meeting guys in the gaps with intensity. Justin Evans continued to show how disrespected he was in the preseason by not being selected to any All-SEC team. Also, I think even our 2s on defense played really well and showed not too much drop off. \n\nI also agree about Trevor. He played well when he settled in, but again was making too many errant throws early (and when he misses, he misses high). I think he improved today though, even considering the competition. PVAMU didn't get pressure much, but the handful of times they did he remained in the pocket and tried to deliver balls downfield, which was great to see. He didn't backpedal out of a clean pocket like he did against UCLA. I think the o-line will continue to improve, and if he can get more and more comfortable in the offense he should continue to improve as well.\n\nI also think the team did a good job of playing 60 minutes, even against an FCS opponent at an 11:00 AM kick, which is tough (just look at other early games throughout the country). I think that shows that they're taking what the coaches said last week to heart, and want to improve every week, which is a good sign of a mental maturity that we lacked the last couple years.","subreddit_id":"t5_2wjlu","subreddit":"12thMan"}

{"body":"These are my notes on the plays.  Thank you, /u/TheValiantPixel for putting this list together.\n\nTL;DR - Williams is a bad, bad man when it comes to blocking.  He laid the wood repeatedly on LBs and helped shore up a surprisingly good blocking effort by the OLine. We ran 42 passing plays and the OLine made mistakes on 5 or 6 of them, which was much better than I thought we'd do, considering the youth of our line. \n\nOverall, I don't think there is anything terrible here, and I'm pretty dang happy about that. \n\n1 - 14:53\t- RSJ dropped the ball.  Come on, man.  This one was scripted and you gotta follow the script.\n\n1 - 14:48\t- Kirk manhandled the corner and got 4 extra yards.\n\n1 - 14:06\t- Overthrew Jeffery.  Not terrible, and it's better to over throw, than under throw and get the pick. \n\n1 - 13:59\t- Great play call, great catch, and great run ... except that Jeffery was channeling his inner JFF.  I'm pretty sure that the coaches will discuss ball security with him this week. Outside of that, it was pretty dang good. \n\n1 - 8:30\t- RSJ forgot that he was a big, strong man that could out physical corner out there.\n\n1 - 7:39\t- This was the first time that the OLine made a mistake, and Prater missed the LB.  Good move by Knight to complete the pass while under duress.  \n\n1 - 7:09\t- penalty called on the OLine for holding.  Good lord, it's such a ticky-tack penalty when compared to the footage that Chavis, Jr. put up on Twitter of our guys being held.  Such is life. \n\n1 - 6:59\t- great job by Reynolds to find the hole in the zone and go up to catch a ball thrown a touch high ... then get down so he doesn't lose his head.\n\n1 - 6:30\t- good play call, and good throw, but Ratley forgot that the job of a WR is to catch the ball.  \n\n1 - 6:21 - This was the old JFF-to-Mike Evans play, but Reynolds wasn't strong enough to fight back in to catch the ball.  It's not a bad idea to get Reynolds 1-on-1 on the outside, so I'm not upset about this.  I just wish it wasn't on 3rd down.\t\n\n1 - 1:41\t- the RT, Eluemunor, lost his bock, but Knight scrambled perfectly and threw on the run, but he threw it about 2 yards too far.  Not terrible, but still not a catch.\n\n***\n\n2 - 10:57 - Kirk jukes a defender.  He makes it look too easy.\t\n\n2 - 10:30\t- That Kirk guy is pretty good. \n\n2 - 10:07\t- Yay, Pope caught the ball! His one appearance for the game. He shouldn't have tried to dance, but unlike RSJ and Tabuyo, he actually caught the ball that was thrown to him, so I'm not upset.\n\n2 - 9:15\t- And then Tabuyo did a good job of catching the ball, making me feel bad for picking on him. Prater was overpowered on this one.  Not terribly, but he was pushed back almost into Knight.\n\n2 - 8:37\t- Nacho can't stop on a dime like Mike Evans could.  Dang it.  Still he caught the ball and tried to get upfield. \n\n2 - 7:52\t- This was a good play.  Kirk got open and Knight saw him and threw the ball too low.  About 18 inches higher and Kirk would have been aiming for a TD.\n\n2 - 4:25\t-  Lanfear completely wiffed on his block. Knight dumped it off to Kirk who made a good play out of it. \n\n2 - 4:11\t- Quick screen to Kirk pays off. \n\n2 - 3:50\t- very good defense by UCLA.  All three receivers are covered perfectly, and Knight throws it away.  I don't see a problem with this one. Dickerson for UCLA makes a good play, taking away the handoff to Williams, then crashing on Knight to force a quick throw. \n\n2 - 3:07\t- Holding by McCoy, and Knight has to throw it early.  If it was anyone beside RSJ, that would have been a TD.  He just isn't that fast, and couldn't get to the ball. In hindsight, it should have been tossed up in the air for him to grab the jump ball. \n\n2 - 0:45\t- Quick pass to Kirk kind of confuses me.  That was a 3 yard out when we needed 6 yards.  Easy pass and easy completion, but no chance of going any further. \n\n***\n\n3 - 13:18\t - stand and deliver and get 33 yards. \n\n3 - 10:21\t- I believe that Williams was so intent on running a route that he completely missed his block.  Luckily there was a quick pass by Knight (knowing he was going to be clocked) and a great catch by Reynolds. \n\n3 - 9:56\t- one of our standard passes to the enzone.  The rub didn't really help RSJ get open, and Knight threw the ball to a place where it was either RSJ or no one.  I'm kinda okay with that.\n\n3 - 9:50\t- Very good play by the corner to ride Reynolds out of bounds.  Prater lost his block, and Knight had to throw it when he did.\n\n3 - 8:07\t- Kirk with a damn good move and RSJ suddenly remembered that he was bigger than everyone out there ... and landed a killer block.  \n\n3 - 7:50\t- Prater lost his block, and Knight threw it to the defender.  It sucks, but it happens.\n\n3 - 4:02\t- Prater completely wiffed on this one.  He could barely slow down his man, but Knight and Reynolds balled out a the right time. \n\n3 - 0:41\t- Fake QB run and toss to Tabuyo was a very good play.  Knight will command some respect with his feet.\n\n3 - 0:27\t- Ball put perfectly, but the corner got his arm in there and lucked out for UCLA.\n\n***\n\n4 - 7:42\t- RSJ turned in.  If he'd have turned out, that would have been a big play.\n\n4 - 7:36\t- Bad play.  Reynolds was double covered and that should have been an INT. Williams and RSJ were both covered. This would have been a good one to tuck and run for a couple of yards.\n\n4 - 4:01\t- If Knight had led Kirk, this would have been a completion.  I think Kirk just dropped it. \n\n4 - 2:34\t- Thrown away.  This one was on Knight for getting too close to Koda Martin, and exposing the block.\n\n4 - 0:37\t- shovel pass, and Williams was two fingertips away from making the 5 yard pass into a 15 yard pass, or more. Great play call considering we hadn't don that up until now. \n\n4 - 0:20\t- Knight backed up too far and exposed both of his tackles.   He had to throw it away or get sacked.  He should have stepped up, but that's life. \n\n4 - 0:14\t-  Ratley and RSJ were in the same area.  It bounced off of Ratley's hands.  He should have caught it, but if he hadn't, RSJ had his defender behind him and might have gotten it. \n\n4 - 0:07\t- That's the jump ball I was calling for. Just a great play by the corner to strip the ball out of RSJ's hands.\n\n4 - 0:03\t- Hail Mary - Good play by the RT.  Knight back peddled a little too far and exposed himself, but it did't matter as he got the ball off cleanly.  Reynolds *almost* got under the pile to grab the TD.  \n\n***\n\nOT - --:--\t- Who the hell are these guys, and where were they in the 4th quarter? Perfect blocking and Reynolds defeated press-coverage and easily converted a 1st down.\n\nOT - --:-- - making it look very easy.\n\n\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2wjlu","subreddit":"12thMan"}

{"body":"Thank you /u/TheValiantPixel for doing this.  I'm going to put my thoughts on each play below. \n\n**First Quarter**\n\n13:20 - excellent coverage by Auburn on this play.  It is text book on how to defend.  Every receiver is covered and TK put the ball out of bounds where it wouldn't be intercepted.\n\n12:05 - incredible play by TWilliams to get his feet under himself and catch the ball.  We gained 6 yards, but if Prater had turned and blocked the other way, we'd have picked up the 1st down.  I think they'll work on that with Prater this week. \n\n11:29 - Elumenor with the roll block!  Check it out.  Easy pitch-and-catch for Reynolds, and a great throwing lane by the right side of the O line.\n\n10:23 - Right guard picked the wrong guy to block, leaving TK open for the sack.  He still got the ball out and into RSJ's hands where it was dropped.  Great play by TK. It also might have been Ford who was supposed to get the block on the DT.  I'm not certain.\n\n7:11 - Extremely strange play to me.  Watch the line.  They block to their left like it was a run play, but Ford is dicking around in no-man's land.  Maybe this was supposed to be a screen? RSJ caught it, which was a huge play.\n\n6:16 - Yeah, this is the gif we'll be seeing forever.  TK hands the ball off to Williams on the right.  Williams was running left.  Complete F-Up by the RB.  Throwing the ball away was very smart.\n\n3:54 - Good blocking, and Elumenor with another roll-block.  \n\n3:19 - simple screen to spread the field.  Gained 6 yards the easy way and made Auburn respect it.  Very nice play call. \n\n2:43 - thrown high to avoid a pick ... but thrown into 3 defenders.  Speedy had a shot deep in man coverage.\n\n2:37 - smart play.  We had 5 OLinemen, and Auburn rushed 6 defenders.  TK got the ball out just in time to the RB who picked up 7 yards.\n\n1:54 - I hate seeing the deep ball on 3rd-and-3, but Kirk had a step on the defender and if they hadn't \"tangled their feet\" then it would have been a TD. Elumenor tried the roll-block and it was almost a sack, if TK hadn't thrown it as fast as he did.\n\n**Second quarter**\n\n14:43 - RSJ actually hit someone.  Very nice play.\n\n13:53 - TK steps up into the pocked and delivers a strike to RSJ down field. Very good blocking by the line.\n\n13:24 - perfect blocking gives TK time to go deep to Reynolds.\n\n12:11 - Check out Elumenor's block on this play.  He shoves his man 4 yards deep and pancakes him.  Perfect throw by TK to get the ball past the LB.  \n\n8:32 - perfect pass to a guy who was double covered.  I like that Kirk guy.\n\n7:53 - This was RJS versus a LB.  This should be a big play, but the LB went too deep and Reynolds wasn't able to scrape him off on the route. TK threw it away because he was about to be sacked.\n\n7:48 - The screen normally works well against the full-blitz.  We got the ball to Kirk, and everyone did their jobs, but this was the perfect defense against this play.  It would have been nice to go to RSJ down field, but TK didn't have time with both LBs coming at him.  If only he couldn't tuck and run ...\n\n6:24 - TK was pretty smart about throwing away the ball, so I have to assume there was a good reason for this.\n\n5:48 - Catch that RSJ!   It hit your hands in the end zone!\n\n3:45 - Speedy's man blitzes and he makes a defender miss.  Good play all around.\n\n3:15 - screen was thrown too high.  It's really impressive to see how TK turns and guns it almost without looking.  Even if completed, it wouldn't have gained much.  The LBs were right there.\n\n2:42 - The shovel pass.  This was only used once in the game and hadn't been used in either of the other games.  Talk about forcing defenses to plan for something you don't often use!  Caught Auburn on their heels and forced them to step back.  Well done.\n\n2:02 - Our Left Tackle with the roll-block this time!  It should have been a TD, but it also could have been a INT.  Good play, but Reynolds needs to hold on.  (Not something we often say!)\n\n**Third Quarter**\n\n15:00 - fake the screen and go deep to Reynolds.  Great play call to start the 3rd Q, but TK went too high. \n\n14:20 - Good coverage and TK was about to get lit up from behind.  The back shoulder throw was the best option in this place. Noil just couldn't get turned around to get it.\n\n9:16 - good call, good route by Speedy, good throw, but a great defensive play by the corner to knock the ball down. \n\n7:56 - Kirk was lit up.  That could have been targeting like we got called for it last year.  Stupid impossible to understand rules.\n\n7:35 - Screen pass was there, but TK over threw the ball.  In his defense, he was backpeddling and about to be hit.\n\n4:18 - We complete a pass in the 3rd Q!  I'm still not sold on this pass-option, but I think it might set up TK for some big runs in the next few games.  It still got us 6 yards and the 1st down.\n\n4:02 - great scramble by TK, and a GREAT block by McCoy to keep the play alive.  TK might have tucked the ball away and run here, but he was trying for a big play.\n\n3:19 - two options on the right side of the field, and both were covered.  Throwing the ball away was a good play, or it would have been a sack.\n\n3:09 - Good play concept.  The other WRs went deep to allow Kirk to have the middle of the field to himself.  If he could have broken that tackle, he'd have had a lot of room to run. Great play on 4th and 3 where the safeties were trying to make sure they didn't give up the home run. Interestingly, TK could have run that ball and probably gotten the 1st down easily, which was probably the call if Kirk was covered better.\n\n2:14 - Good route by Speedy, as the defender #15 came up to help with TWilliams, making this an easy pitch and catch for 19 yards.\n\n1:20 - perfect blocking by the OLine.  TK has all the time in the world against a great defense.  Unreal.  Speedy went out of bounds and came back in, but we can't tell if he was pushed out.  He might not have been eligible to catch it.  Great defense on the other receivers by the Auburn D.\n\n1:13 - since the majority of the receivers were lined up to the top of the field, and TK never looked that way, I have to believe this was a designed run.  He threw it away when the LB stayed back to defend him.\n\n**Fourth quarter**\n\n13:08 - Watch the OLine on this one.  They pull to block left for a Twilliams run, and then TK throws right for a screen to Reynolds.  What a great concept to say F-U to the linebackers.  Great run by Reynolds to use his blockers in a textbook run.\n\n12:57 - Simple screen to try to open some running lanes for the RB.\n\n12:25 - When do you throw into double coverage?  This is when you throw into double coverage.  Watch the interplay between Kirk and Speedy at the bottom of the screen.  Kirk sells the screen pass and Speedy acts like he's going to block and then releases down field.  I love head games like this to mess with defenses.\n\n10:24 - RSJ should have been awarded a point for effort.  He missed the TD by 2 inches or less.  Well done.  Reynolds cleared out 3 defenders, and the Yell Boys look silly, like always. :)\n\n7:22 - This is when Coach Sumlin says, \"Mazzone, if you pass again in this game, I will fire you.\"  \"Okay coach.\"\n\nThoughts:\n\nOur OLine coach deserves a raise.  A really, really, really big one.  Can someone hit the lottery and give it to him? \n\nThe third quarter was tough.  I think Auburn switched up their plan and it took us some time to get our feet on the ground. \n\nWe need to work on throwing on 3rd down ... but maybe we are playing the long con for the Alabama game!  (Or maybe not, but I can believe!)","subreddit_id":"t5_2wjlu","subreddit":"12thMan"}

It wasn't hard to get my opponents to play around Avenge/get down and put themselves in a weak position in the early game when it turned out not to be either one. I don't remember it killing anything that good when it finally activated since by that time the opponent knew what it was.\n\nI think I picked it because the other options were terrible and I already had the Mad Scientist. Then picking Avian Watcher made at least some sense because Sacred Trial was likely to stick around a long time. And in several games it did and the Watcher did get buffed, which was usually worth more than the secret's actual effect.\n\nInteresting point about taking risks in the draft. To get to 12 wins, even if you're good and have an insane draft, luck also has to be on your side at least a little.

{"body":"Campaign 1: Dungeon World\n\nCampaign 2: Pathfinder\n\nCampaign 3: 13th Age\n\n\n**Talbot Moore:** *Leader of Ki'Toran, and founder of The Dominion. A hedonistic, sadistic, and flamboyant leader of the Wastes. He teaches those who wish to learn The Song of Life. Its not as docile as it sounds.*\n\nThis campaign is set a thousand years after our last one. He is a result of the players leaving a plot hook hanging involving the Kytons, a group of devils from hell that were too evil and wierd so they were kicked out and decided to call the Shadow Plane home, think hellraiser. Talbot moore is their leader, and runs a cult/city deep in the shadow tainted Wastes. A mix of fantasy Las Vegas and pure horror. \n\n**The Barbarian**:  *New to the scene, a warrior of great might that is in the process of conquering the Orlon Clans.*\n\nThe Orlon are a race of 9 to 10 feet tall giants that call the Otak Highlands their home. They hate magic, and have selectively removed arcane magic users from their blood lines. Tribal by nature and live in secluded clans. beleive that clerics and preists are saving them from the gods by draining the gods power, keeping the gods chained up.  The barbarian is a Preist of Vile-Jaw, a war god and NPC from Campaign 1.\n\n**The Black Wing:**  *A creature worshiped and feared as a deity by the Valian, and just simply feared by everyone else. King of Darkvale, and holder of the Shadow Tear.*\n\nA fallen angel and one of the antagonists from Campaign 2. He traded all his power to the remaining few Drow in the world, and in return they got their revenge. But they lost their souls to him. He holds two incredibly powerful artifacts: The Shadow Tear, and a Planar Agate Sword infused with the Essense of Law. The Shadow Tear is basically the Shadow Plane contained in a crystal, or also known as The Heart of the Shadow Plane. Each Plane has one, and allows the holder to do incredible things. Planar Agate is caused when two Planes collide forming a crystal like substance. Extremely rare. It is one of the only things that can hold the powers from Tears, and he used it to contain Law from the material plane in campaign 2.\n\n**The Guardian of Creation:**  *The keeper of the Tree of Life, and the people who live inside. A wise and calm leader. The last of a long forgotten race, the depth of his mediation is unfathomable.* \n\nPlanted a tree under the Essence of Creation in Campaign 2, now he is cursed with guarding the tree for all eternity. As the tree grew is took over the power of Creation, and became the Tree of Life. He's a giant gorilla, and extremely peaceful, but prone to chronic neutrality. \n\n**The Lamp Lighter:**  *As deadly as he is selfless. His entire goal in life is simply to keep back the Dominion. He created and maintains the Lamp Line, a wall of light powered by magical lamps that hold the shadow at bay.*\n\nA God from Campaign 1, and a Player from Campign 2 mixed into one body. A result from the conclusion of Campaign 2. He looks like an asimar mixed with an elf, but bald. He used the last of his divine spark to create a wall of lamps that holds the Wastes at bay, and keeps the evil at bay. \n\n**The Lost Emperor**:  *A truly righteous, and good leader. He once united all the Kingdoms of Laevel under one banner. A feat never accomplished before, but now he's gone and no one knows where to. Despite that mess that is happening in Laevel, there are still devote followers of the Emperor.*\n\nHes a major player in this current campaign, though the players haven't discovered who he is, or where he is yet. Lots of fun with this one. Don't want to give too much away in case they are reading this.\n\n**The Prime Organizer:**  *The title given to the current leader of the Far-Roost Trade Guild. The eldest Far-Roost child takes the seat of power, and Kato Far-Roost has proven a formidable leader and trader, spreading the Far-Roost signature guns all over the world.*\n\nCampaign 2 I had a tengu gunslinger who wanted to create a merchant business. He eventually turned that into a city. Now in campaign 3 it is the worlds first corperation, and is run by the blood line of the player from campaign 2. \n\n**The Raptor**:  *The Wutarians have always had a fear of the outside world, and in the last few hundred years this has turned to a fear of Magic. The Raptor is the leader of The Hawks; a group dedicated to the regulation and control of magic users.*\n\nThe Wutarians were the tengu that stayed behind and didn't follow Alban (player from campaign 2), to the new city. They had a fear of magic users back then and their isolation has just fostered even more fear.\n\n**The Rat King:**  *A creature of hatred and pure vengeance. Left behind in a castle of trash and rats for a few thousand years has left a sour taste in his mouth. The rats he leads are the size of children, and about as smart. And just like children, the rats can be cruel.*\n\nThe players had a robot body inhabited by the soul of a thunderbird from the Air Plane. He travelled with them for a while until they came to the Essence of Entropy. Guarded by a race of rat creatures their king the players decided to kill the guardian and try to take entropy, like the Black Wing did with law. What they didn't know was that who ever kills the old guardian must become the new guardian. They placed this curse on their NPC friend, and went merrily on their way. Decades of being isoloated from the world with nothing but evil rats, and the power of entropy to keep him company has created the Rat King. \n\n**The Snake**:  *A D'suran with a face identical to her thousands of sisters. The Snake is a master of disguise, and intrigue. Almost every unknown solved mystery is attributed to The Snake, and for good reason. Most are probably tied to her, some how.*\n\nMore of a title like the Dread Pirate Roberts, then a singular person. The D'sura are a race of identical creatures. The Snake uses this to her advantage to keep hidden. \n\n\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2xyuo","subreddit":"13thage"}

{"body":"I did my first 14er last weekend.  I've been living out here for about 8 months.  I do a lot of cycling and mountain biking and go above 10k feet at least weekly riding bikes(3-6 hour rides).  So I'm used to the altitude and fairly in shape.  I am not a very strong hiker though I found out last weekend.  \n\nWe did Grey's and Torrey's which are probably one of the busiest summits to hit.  It's like I read online, summit with 500 of your closest friends.  We left Denver at 4:30AM and the trailhead was full when we got there around 5:45.  We parked on the side of the road behind two other cars, but weren't far from the TH at all.  Despite the large number of people the trails were not crowded and the summit had about 20 people lingering around as people come and go, which is fine.  \n\nThe sign there says \"Family Friendly 14er\" but man that thing whipped my ass.  Grey's is a Class1 and Torrey's trails are Class 2.  If we had just done Greys I think it would have been fine, going down the saddle and back up to Torrey's is what really wore me out.  I think anyone who is reasonably physically fit could hike both of those peaks, but give yourself plenty of time.  We were out for about 7 hours, with 5 hours of moving time (breaks often near the tops).  Also bring a good AWD or 4WD car to get to the TH the road is pretty gnarly to that TH.  \n\nIf you want a real nice solo quiet hike I might recommend some of the Colorado Trail segments.  I biked Miner's Creek pass (12.5k) and I ran into about 10 people on a 5 hour ride.  It can be done out/back from Copper Mountain or go up to Searle Pass (12.1k), which is the other direction from Copper Mountain.  Searle pass is a bit more crowded with mountain bikers, but not like the Front Range crowded just more than 0.  \n\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2srvd","subreddit":"14ers"}

So sick in fact, that I did not finish the book. I did get to the part that introduced the ladies. I did not like the use of (apparently) diary entries by the wife.  But you know how it is, everyone's a critic. \n\nDoctor G was a very well-written character. His down-time way of thinking was accurately depicted. (Think how hard it must be to get into the head of a person from so long ago.) Everything came back to his alchemy. That said, he was not very likable.  \n\nI am only an occasional RoF reader in the last few years.

{"body":"I thought there were several interesting female characters in this book.  Most significantly was the wife of Doctor Grubbleflotz and his mother (basically a down-time version of Velma Hardesty) and of course the group of women who hired the good doctor to make baking soda.  The reference to Viagra with the \"little blue pills of happiness\" was also cute along with some very disappointed women.... although working the \"Spanish Fly\" into the book was rather interesting and odd.\n\nFrom the perspective of the era and noting this book is mostly told from the view of a downtimer, it completely makes sense why women were very tertiary characters though.  I wouldn't say it was deliberate avoiding writing about women, just that in the situations that the protagonist found himself in were mostly male dominated situations... at least until the Ring of Fire happened in the story line.\n\nI agree though that the pre RoF stuff was nice to see explored, as this book covers a rather broad range of years.  References to this character in other books sort of paint this character rather flat and simple manner, so it was also nice to see him fleshed out as a real character with depth and meaning to what he did.  His interaction with Tom Stone is something I wish had been fleshed out a little more though.\n\nI don't know if some of the up-time attitudes that Grubbleflotz had were anachronistic though like his constant washing of hands between patients and his disbelief of the humor system practiced by medical doctors of the time.... all before the RoF.  His background of avoiding a traditional education might account for some of that, but I really do wonder if anybody of the era without exposure to uptime ideas would have ever thought of those kind of things?","subreddit_id":"t5_39aso","subreddit":"1632"}

[Here is a good one](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__40274__Hobbyking_YEP_20A_HV_2_12S_SBEC_w_Selectable_Voltage_Output.html) that you could use with a [BMS like this](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/3S-11-1V-10A-BMS-PCM-Protection-Board-Lithium-Li-ion-Battery-New-/272344061620?hash=item3f68f896b4:g:l0kAAOSwdzVXsrmV)","subreddit_id":"t5_38zm9","subreddit":"18650masterrace"}

{"body":"Great idea. IMO you should go at it this way: Charge the batteries and test the pack on the drill. While screwing something in, test the amperage. In my experience it should be around 15A. Look up your batteries datasheet and check how many A you can draw (should be around 4A) So if this is the case, I would just forget about it. IF the batteries can handle it (check also if they get hot), buy that BMS and hook it up. In that BMS you can just feed 21V and it will charge and balance. If you don't mind the hassle, do it with the hobby charger. But first let us know how many amps it draws when you have the time.","subreddit_id":"t5_38zm9","subreddit":"18650masterrace"}

{"body":"You really don't want to go 18650 for this.  Prismatic LiFePO4 packs are the best replacement for lead acid in storage systems like this.  A 4S pack of them is very, very close to a 6S/12V lead acid system in terms of important voltages, and you can't build a more standard lithium ion chemistry into that voltage profile until you're looking at 24V or 48V packs.\n\nIf you're building a large 18650 bank without a BMS, and you're using something other than spinel LiMn, you're insane, and are building a future blowtorch.  Don't.  They need balancing.

{"body":"Actually, gotta say, I use mine a good bit. It easily charges back in a day what you use at night. It can run something like two whole days straight with the flood light on. \n\nNow if you're looking to use it for 7-8 hours a night straight (but who does that?) and still charge a phone or something every single day you probably would drain it and need a booster solar panel like the Nomad that goal zero makes to get it back to full charge by solar alone in a single day. \n\nThe hand crank also works nice if the battery is low. 9 times out of 10 I just charged it at the wall with my other 18650's though. If I'm camping for a weekend or whatever it never dies under real world use.\n\nMy only real complaint is the rubber coating could be tougher.

It really is tough to beat Colt, especially since they're making the best 1911s they ever have (in terms of overall quality, older guns had better finishes, but their modern guns are better in nearly every other single way).\n\nNo other maker regardless of price offers a combination of a forged frame, slide, barrel and slide stop and Colt is the only maker, regardless of price, that proof loads and magnetic particle inspects every single barrel (no batch testing).\n\nIf you can save up just a little more than $700 your money will be very well spent.\n\nHowever, if $700 is your absolute limit I would suggest Ruger over RIA.  I have no doubt RIA makes a good budget 1911, but if you're going to get a cast frame (like RIA) get one from Ruger whose Pine Tree Casting makes frames for Caspian-which is considered one of, if not the best in the business.","subreddit_id":"t5_2rtpo","subreddit":"1911"}

{"body":"I'll second /u/RockWhiskey, but with a couple small caveats.\n\nFirst off, I'm a Colt fan, but I've owned a couple TRPs and know SA can make a very, very good 1911.\n\nI haven't seen a SA MilSpec recently, not since they moved all production to the U.S.  In the past those I've shot or handled ranged from tight to slightly loose.\n\nI mention that because as a TRP owner you may be disappointed with the frame to slide fit of the Colt.  It will be snug, not tight, which some folks equate with low quality.  Nothing further from the truth...Colt still adhere's to the original spec of the 1911 which calls for small but deliberate clearances and tolerances between the frame and slide for the best combination of reliability and accuracy.\n\nEven if the Colt's frame and slide seem a little loose compared to others the barrel is going to be exceptionally well fit, which is the true key to accuracy and durability.\n\nAlso bear in mind Colt does far more hand finishing than any other production manufacturer.  This means each and every Colt is unique and almost all will have some small imperfections which in no way hurts function or looks.  If you're extremely anal about the rear of the frame and slide being almost perfectly blended you may not like a Colt.  Some will be well mated in this area (among others) some less so.  It's just luck of the draw and depends on how the individual parts used in the gun went together.\n\nThe trigger will be less stellar than your TRP.  Colt's triggers are by no means bad, by production standards they're very good, but they range from good to average.  If you get one that's almost as good as your TRP it's a simple fluke of tolerance stacking and parts that happen to fit each other better than average.\n\nIf you understand that going in you'll be happy with a Colt.  They are making exceptional guns again, probably the best in a couple generations, maybe even the best ever overall with newer CNC machining and QC.\n\nIf that makes it sound like Colt is crap, that's not the case at all.  Much of the quality of a Colt is inside, just as the link /u/RockWhiskey explains.","subreddit_id":"t5_2rtpo","subreddit":"1911"}

Like with many things in life, don't buy the cheapest or the most expensive. \n\nI'd recommend a \"good-better-best\" kind of approach. As a minimum, I'd recommend looking at Ruger's SR1911. It's a good gun and reasonably priced. As a better option, I'd check out Springfield Armory. They use forged slides and frames vs. Ruger's cast offerings. One of my brothers has been regularly shooting his Springfield Mil-Spec for well over ten years. No broken parts to report in all that time and thousands upon thousands of rounds. As a \"best\" option (extremely subjective here) I'd recommend a Colt. They offer the very best value for their price point. They might still be the only firm out there offering a forged barrel, but I'm not as in touch with the 1911 industry as I have been in the past. \n\nThis is just an opinion of one guy about three very basic choices that I wouldn't be ashamed to own. Check out Sig, S&amp;W, Dan Wesson, Remington or any of the other household names you'll see around the sub. There are so many other good names to choose from that range all over from genuinely good to outstanding before you even approach the semi-customs like Baer, Brown and Wilson. \n\nHonestly, and I don't mean to hurt feelings here, I'd stay away from the lower end 1911's like Rock Island Armory until you have some experience with a 1911 that's more up to par. Some will gripe at me about this, but I've been inside of RIA 1911's more than most users here. The internals of their frame castings are really pretty sloppy, and the quality of small parts really isn't very good. They'll go bang and look cool for $400, but they aren't going to offer the build quality and accuracy that make the 1911 so attractive. ","subreddit_id":"t5_2rtpo","subreddit":"1911"}

{"body":"The slide stop lug (the part that contacts the magazine follower, which locks the slide back when empty) is too long. Either read online about how to file it or send it back to Colt, they'll fix it no questions asked.  It shouldn't happen, but these are mass-produced guns and sometimes mistakes slip through, it can happen to any manufacturer.\n\nEdit: what's happening is the slide stop lug is too long, contacting the nose of a round, which pushed the slide stop up, prematurely locking the slide back. It most likely took time to develop because Colt makes their slide stops with a small raised ring around the slide stop cross pin to allow a small clearance between the slide stop and frame to allow debris to pass through. Yours likely has a ring on the crosspin out of spec or even a small burr which ground away allowing the slide stop and lug to move too far into the frame.","subreddit_id":"t5_2rtpo","subreddit":"1911"}

Good habits will save you more often than training. It isn't the shit you do when think about it that counts. It's what you do without thinking that will make or break your day.

At what point did we as a society of gun owners just decide that this type of thing wasn't dangerous any more? Do any of the most seasoned professional shooters become so skilled and so familiar with their weapons that trigger discipline is no longer needed? I haven't seen any. Would any responsible gun owner teaching child allow them to do this? I highly doubt it. I hope not anyway. If I ever see this when I am instructing shooters, it is quickly and sternly corrected. At what point does a person become skilled or experienced enough to start ignoring certain aspects of basic gun safety? Does our host's familiarity with the firearm mean much in the event of a negligent discharge that causes him to lose some finger weight? Somehow, I doubt it. \n\nObviously the guy in the video is confident that the pistol was unloaded. We all know that it is safe to handle a gun however you want as soon as you're \"sure\" it's unloaded. Right? Guys? \n\nWhile they're not for me, I'm not trying to attack forward cocking serrations. They're a vestigial remnant from older competition guns who's sights made it impractical to use the rear serrations. Like many things competition, they became a stylistic part of many 1911's on the market today. \n\nIn short, I firmly believe the unnecessary practice is a very dangerous habit that has become somewhat accepted and should be recognized as such.

Ruger lightweights will have titanium inserts so not an issue there. Check the barrel throat for custom ramping or impact damage.\n\nCheck the barrel lock up and bushing fit.

{"body":"I've been into RIA 1911's beyond just tinkering. The link to part one is near the top of the comments of part two. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/1911/comments/3xxxm7/the_sonata_project_part_2/?st=ITDH9PHR&amp;sh=3332b8af\n\nMy purpose is not to be inflammatory, but totally honest and frank about the nature of these guns. What I was getting at was something that is almost completely misunderstood in the gun community, which is quality control. Lower standards in quality control means that a company will accept a wider range of manufacturing error. This is where the most misused term in the sport comes into play. Tolerance. Tolerance is not the distance between two given features. That is a clearance. Tolerance is the range of values that a company has designated as acceptable. \n\nI work as a machinist for an OEM firearms manufacturer. I inspect and machine gun parts for a living. I can tell you with absolute certainty that RIA's tolerances are much wider than the \"$1000\" 1911's. \nThis means that when a dimension is checked at Colt, and the print has a callout for +/- .001\" on a particular feature, they re-work or scrap a part that is +/- .002\". We're talking half the wall thickness of a soda can here. (Totally normal expectation in machining.) That costs money. That's one of the reasons why their guns cost more, but you get what you pay for. In the same scenario at Armscor, they might not find the same given feature to be out of spec until it's +/- .004\" or even more. A greater amount of erroneous clearance  is tolerated, hence the term. This isn't to say that they can't or won't produce a part that is right down the middle of the spec and measures as closely as possible to the desired dimension. They certainly will. It just means that it is essentially by accident because they are willing to accept all of the other parts coming off of the production line that build guns with \"minute of Volkswagen\" accuracy. Keep in mind, we haven't even discussed quality of materials yet. \n\nIf you happened across a good one, that's awesome. No sarcasm here. Being happy with what they have purchased or inherited is something I wouldn't want to ruin for anyone. But I can't honestly tell anybody that RIA makes as great a gun as \"$1000\" brands either, because I understand how profitable firearms manufacturing works.

Harsh testing including salt baths, sand cabinets, freezing the guns until coated with ice then shooting until too hot to touch (and repeating over thousands of rounds) which eventually showed cracks forming on the rail and slide of some guns.\n\nColt has always been know for the quality and durability of their frames and slides, which is why they're the preferred choice for custom gunsmiths.  There was nothing wrong with their metallurgy, just their design (which was similar to virtually every other railed 1911 currently on the market).\n\nColt responded by significantly enlarging the frame rail (it's truly gigantic compared to all others) and changing the position, depth and spacing of the slide serrations.  Colt also developed a dual recoil spring system which allows use of .45 +P for extended periods, requiring replacement after 10,000 rounds. After these changes the guns passed with flying colors.\n\nThe only added change after this was the finish, originally cerakote as decided by the Marines.  Cerakote isn't the toughest of finishes and flakes easily no matter who applies it.  Current guns use IonBond which is much more durable.\n\nThere really is no doubt which is the better gun between the two.","subreddit_id":"t5_2rtpo","subreddit":"1911"}

The difficulty is coming from two sources, then - the friction between your firing pin stop and the hammer and the force required to overcome your mainspring.\n\nI recommend taking some 600 grit (or higher) and gently polishing - gently - the radius on your firing pin stop. If there are any machining/tool marks on that piece, it adds to the difficulty in racking the slide. Youtube will guide your way.\n\nI also recommend changing out the Springfield ILS mainspring and mainspring housing for a conventional setup. Take the time to make sure there are no burrs or machining marks on your hammer strut or mainspring cap. Smooth mating surfaces help.

It's Rockwell hardness is 65 or higher and unlike bumper or decorative chrome it will never chip or peel because it forms a molecular bond with steel.  It is nearly impossible to scratch, unless you use something like a tool steel file and it's almost impervious to rust.  Friction is reduced so much that lubrication isn't even necessary (I still lubricate mine like any other gun) which also means cleaning is a snap. Nothing sticks to it-even the hardest of carbon deposits wipe off with ease.\n\nBest of all, it's a gorgeous finish as well.\n\nThe only downsides are cost ($400-$500) or if for some strange reason you don't like it refinishing is impossible.\n\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2rtpo","subreddit":"1911"}

It means they don't reject one that isn't as accurate. By not eating the cost of manufacturing by rejecting it, they pass the savings and lower quality standards on to the consumer.\n\nThis is basically manufacturing works. Company pays $X for every single unit they make, good or junk. The more they scrap, the less money they make. Wider tolerances make less waste and more money provided the end product is acceptable to the customer. If the customer base will accept those tolerances based on a given price point, the product goes out the door. \n\nThe longer they are in the business, the better they get at making guns in terms of quality per minute invested per unit.

You won't be disappointed in the gun, Commanders are both great shooters and carry guns. \n\nDo you know if it's a \"Combat\" (steel frame) or a \"Lightweight\" (aluminum frame) Commander? That may make a difference for you. Generally speaking, aluminum frames have shorter lifespans (measured by round count) than a similar steel frame, however they are lighter and tend to carry a little better. There are also some challenges to having an aluminum feed ramp with using some hollowpoints and some magazines with steel followers. Just things to keep in mind. \n\nI'd say go for it if it's a steel frame, but maybe take some things into consideration (which we can help you with) before you buy it if it's an aluminum frame.

{"body":"So this weekend I got some new grips for my favorite Colt. I wanted some grips made from mammoth ivory, but the $400+ price tag was just too much so I went with these cherry VZs. I don't care for the crazy aggressive VZs, but I like the more refined look and feel of these.\n\nSo...the funny story. This weekend I hit the range and frankly shot like Ray Charles. My glasses are now seven years old and I can't see shit.\n\nSince I couldn't hit the broad side of a barn at 25 yards I scooped up some spent cases, mixed them with a few live rounds to practice malfunction clearing.\n\nTo my suprise, the SCG actually feed empty rounds without isseue-when using Chip McCormick mags.  I switched to Wilson Combat mags which would FTF empty cases every time.\n\nThis is no knock on Wilson mags, they're great. They do however sort of \"skip\" the controlled feed design of the 1911's feed ramp and instead aim the rounds into the chamber like more modern designs. This easily explains why hey wouldn't feed empty rounds when the Chips would, but then again no pistol was ever meant to feed empty cases.\n\nAt any rate the only guns I've ever owned (besides this SCG) that would reliably feed empty rounds were S&amp;W 4506s.

{"body":"More expensive ammo usually means better ammo but not all ways. I personally prefer to shoot my hand loads because I know exactly how much powder is dropped, the way I drop powder I am at a max of +0.1 grains. My 45acp 230 grain loads recoil like 9mm. That being said if I am buying factory ammo I get the cheap stuff. In my opinion better ammo is more consistent in regards to cartridge overall length, weight of the powder charge, primer seating and consistency of impact required to detonate it and so on. The reason that some ammo is more reliable in some guns than others is because not all ammunition is exactly the same, nor are all magazines, feed ramps, chambers, extractors and so on. Unless you are shooting .22lr you should not have any problems with your 1911 not liking some brands vs others in terms of fmj unless they are garbage ammo.

That makes me think it could have been installed wrong... Could very well also be a defect with the gun though, not sure. \n\nIf you have a chance, when you check for the 'N' (you will need to remove the lever to see it), try to see if that bottom lever will even assemble backwards or not. I think it will fit backwards with the other trigger parts, but I'm not sure if it will fit into the interior cutouts in the frame if it's backwards. That'd be good to know. I'd try it myself, but I don't have a Series 80 gun laying around that I'm willing to detail strip (my GCNM has some extra sear parts that are a giant pain in the ass, my SCRG is absolutely *filthy* lol, and my Commander is on holster duty with a buddy still) unfortunately. \n\n&gt;The first time I detail stripped the gun, they threw me off because I was using your guide in the wiki.\n\nMan, sorry about that.

{"body":"Well damn. It's also possible that the plunger is getting chewed up as a symptom of the problem, and not the cause. \n\nCan you tell if the firing pin is binding because the metal got peened from hitting the plunger? In other words, does it look like metal got mushed out of place so it's now binding in the firing pin channel, as opposed to being made out of spec to begin with?\n\nYou won't need to hand fit a firing pin or a plunger, however, they could be damaged as a result of the firing pin safety being timed incorrectly, vs the firing pin and/or plunger being out of spec. If that's the case, the new parts will likely just get chewed up, too, so I wouldn't replace anything until we troubleshoot some more. \n\nDepending on your answer to my above question, we can either continue troubleshooting or you can send it back under warranty. The easier/cheaper solution is to send it back. Colt's customer service is very good, but unfortunately it's not typically fast (they are really swamped and understaffed, yay for poor management). If you want fast, we *may* be able to get it resolved with a few dollars in parts. Not sure yet. \n\nAnd I'm sorry this happened, especially after we speak so highly of Colts here.

{"body":"- Don't fuck with the wildlife - It will fuck you back.\n- If you're called a cunt, it could be positive or negative \"You're a shit cunt mate\" is bad \"Fucken top job cunt\" = positive\n- You don't have to tip, people are paid properly here.\n- If you have a medical problem, go to the hospital. (Removed the free bit because I'm a dumb cunt)\n- If you go in the water, be prepared for a jellyfish sting. Lifeguards on the beach have shit to help deal with the sting. Don't pull it off with your fingers. You can piss on it and it should detach.\n- Even on an overcast day, you still get sunburnt. Make sure you slip slop slap like a smart cunt.\n- Thongs are \"flip flops\". Most places in Aus will accept thongs as suitable footwear, if they don't, tell them to get fucked for being un-Australian.\n- Shorts, Thongs and a wife beater is a perfectly acceptable outfit for 90% of the places you visit.\n- There is spiders, snakes and other venomous shit everywhere. Be careful. If you get bitten by something, proceed immediately to the hospital, so they can sort you out. We have antivenom for pretty much every single animal that could kill you.\n- Longys are an abbreviation for long necked beers. If someone offers you a longy, don't be a shit cunt and refuse. Have a swig like a champ.\n- Bottlo's are Alcohol Shops, Chemist is a \"Drug Store\", Servo is a Petrol Station, Woolies is a supermarket.\n- If you're driving at night, keep an eye out for kangaroos, wombats, sheep, etc. They will absolutely fucking wreck your car.\n- Our humour is fucking tops. Swearing is acceptable. If someone starts taking the piss out of you, they aren't doing it to be a shit cunt, they are being friendly and bringing the bants. Respond accordingly.\n- If someone invites you for a barbie, make sure you bring something. (Salad, Drinks, slab of piss, crate of lager, box of favourites, whatever)\n- No drugs are legal here, but weed isn't really a huge issue if you get caught. $110 fine.\n- Watch out for drop bears. Regardless of what you may have heard, those things are fucking ferocious AF.\n- We have giant 3ft lizards that will run at you, and try and climb you like a tree with big fucking claws. They will chase you if you run, so you better learn to become a tree real quick.\n- If you wanna cross the Outback, make sure you're prepared. Its a 4000km trip full of bullshit and danger and sand. Prepare accordingly.\n- If you see a big rig truck, make sure you give him the old \"Toot ya fuckin' horn you cunt\" arm gesture, they love it.\n- If you wanna try Vegemite, spread a LITTLE BIT on some toast with butter. If you knock back a spoonful, you'll hate it.\n- Drink lots of water, or keep a litre of water handy somewhere if you're away from people.\n- If you say \"Chuck a shrimp on the barbie\" you'll likely cop a solid glassing.\n- If you try and order a Fosters at ANY pub in Australia, they will laugh at you.\n- If you get bitten by something venomous or poisonous, get someone to catch whatever it was that bit you and take it to the hospital with you. Not only does it allow the hospital to administer the correct anti-venom, but they will also send it off to the specialist to milk its venom to create more anti-venom. (Obviously if she's a 6ft angry as fuck red bellied black snake, use some common fucking sense and leave it alone, I can't believe I have to clarify this you fucks)\n- Make sure you take the pilgrimage to the local Bunnings for a sausage sanga on a weekend.\n\n\n*Massive cheers to the fucking legend who gilded me.

{"body":"I definitely agree that Jim Bob gives off a creepy vibe, but I am not convinced that Michelle is much better. From the show, I think Michelle does show more interest in her kids than Jim Bob does, but that really isn't saying much. I appreciate her approach to parenting that I have seen on the show. Shedoesn't raise her voice, and I have seen many cases where she was patient and gentle with the children. It really is hard to tell though, because the show really only gives us a glimpse of their life. I've never heard her describe any of her children in any non generic way. They are always \"sweet (if they are a girl), helpful, heart for the Lord\". I feel as if she cared more about popping out all the children she could, then about the children that were growing right in front of her.\nIt is hard to judge her, as she has been cooped up in the environment of \"the husband is the God of the house\". I was raised in a religious household, and my ex-religion taught us about how the man was a leader of a household. It wasn't quite as extreme as the umbrella approach taught in the Duggar household, but it made you think twice before questioning your father/elder men. \nPersonally, I would threaten divorce if molestation happened under my roof and was not followed by intense counseling/rehab. I would have insisted the Josh be separated from the girls so that they could feel safe in their own homes. But, at that time Michelle had 14 kids. She has no education, no marketable skills and it doesn't seem like she has much of a connection with her own family. So I can sympathize with her situation, but I am pretty sure that any rumors about her fighting for pressing charges are purely speculation. I can't see any Duggar releasing that information because they are all convinced that they acted perfectly responsibly following the repeated molestation events.","subreddit_id":"t5_31ev2","subreddit":"19KidsandCounting"}

The whole point of the no-touching during courtship is to allow you to approach a potential spouse with your head clear of the rush of emotions that come with sexual contact, but Jinger's intense infatuation (to the point where she can't even handle her normal chore load or a few hours away from her phone), only serve to show that the whole courtship thing is a farce- at least the way the Duggars are doing it.\n\nI hope, for everyone's sake, that I'm wrong and just observing the power of selective editing.  \"Fast tracking\" marriage does work out for some people, but I've only ever seen it be successful when both people getting involved are mature and ready for the difficulties ahead.

However, his socially awkward way of talking about it and inappropriate financial probing definitely indicate that he's not the reigning authority on being well-adjusted.\n\nYou know, for being the authority of his household, and given that he must give his permission for any of this to happen, I think it's becoming increasingly clear that this is just another example of how the Duggars are rule obsessed without really understanding the point of the rules.  In courtship, a young man seeks a young woman's father's permission and guidance because the father, as an authority figure, is supposed to be guiding the young people toward a mature and rational decision.

Suddenly, he rediscovers his faith, reaches out to Jim Bob asking him to become \"a prayer buddy\" (I guess that is how you impress a fundie) and flies to Nepal where he did some sightseeing while skyping Jim Bob. When Jim Bob falls for him, he starts talking about getting a bride. Probably said something along the lines \"sweet, helpful and with a heart for the Lord\" and Jim Bob realised he has 9 carbon copies of this.\n\n\nJill was not particularly difficult to seduce, and here they are married. Derrick quits his job, get his teeth done and starts flying between central America and US. Also gets a free house and money. Jill still not pregnant with second child can mean he is smart enough not to get her pregnant in a Zika infested area and after a C-section. Also he encouraged Jill to finish her midwife certification, and made her learn spanish and get involved with the locals when she was in to be a housewife. He got far away from the Duggars and set his own rules instead of becoming Jim Bob's yard boy like Ben. Now he lives a hippie life with a hot wife and a son (a single one) while Jim Bob foots the bill for him. He went to a secular university, and his family does not look fundie or even pretend to be for the cameras. So I think he may be playing a game there. \n\n\n\nThe issue I have with Ben is that he is completely spineless. His \"preaching\" is basically posting pseudo intellectual videos on YouTube. I just can't imagine him enforcing any rules in his house.

All this courtship thing, always pleasing your husband,  asking your dad before dating someone, look just like sexual roleplay.

{"body":"S2 E4\n\n**Jeremy and Jinger** \n\nBAAABE\n\nSo far in the show, they\u2019ve been courting for only 3 weeks but Jinger is already heading off to Laredo Texas to meet her man\u2019s parents. She and her brothers already calls them her in-laws. The \u201cinlaws\u201d seem pretty chill. The mother even wears actual pants! Her nail wall hanging art is pretty cool though. Jeremy shows off his apartment Jill is so fake about complimenting it. Jeremy plays a romantic song he sang and recorded on his phone and even puts his ARM AROUND HER SHOULDER. Jinger even puts her head on his shoulder. They visit downtown Laredo and go into pawn shops. Jim Bob acts like a total loser and interrogates Jeremy about how much money he makes. Jeremy\u2019s parents have the tact to not point out that Jinger is completely unemployable. Jeremy shows off the tiny church where he preaches. Even Jinger admitted that being in front of her parents for intimate good byes was super awkward. \n\nJinger has gone completely bonkers to the point where she can\u2019t do laundry. It makes me wonder how she would keep a job.  \n\n**Jill and Derrick**\n\nBeing a missionary apparently only consists of giving like 2-3 sermons a week. Jill invites some women who are her neighbors for a casual Bible study. Jill can still barely speak Spanish. The pastor\u2019s wife who shows up seems genuinely helpful and counsels women through marital problems, but Jill just sits there and looks uncomfortable. \n\n**Joy and John David**\n\nJoy is fast becoming the coolest Duggar. John David (another cool Duggar) teaches her to fly planes. John David seems like the only Duggar who could get a real job and support himself. I really hope Joy sticks with it and gets her license. \n\n**Joy, Jed, and Jere**\n\nThe Duggars hold a \u201cgraduation\u201d party for some of the kids. They get fake diplomas for their fake high school experience. Jana sets the whole party up for a couple hundred people. The boys say they want to flip cars. Joy doesn\u2019t talk about her dreams beyond helping the kids, but maybe the pilot\u2019s license will work out for her.  \n\n\n\n","subreddit_id":"t5_31ev2","subreddit":"19KidsandCounting"}

{"body":"This is all anecdotal and I have no room to claim any special knowledge on the subject, but...\n\nPersonally I don't think you're wrong, but I don't think it's as big a deal as you're making it out to be either. Take ALD-52 for example - for all intents and purposes, it is acid. You can take it for the same purpose and achieve relatively the same effects. They are not, however, the same chemical, and I don't think it's out of the question that they would have slightly different subjective effects. *Slightly* different.\n\nMy take on it is that LSD-25, 1P-LSD, and ALD-52 are all acid for all intents and purposes. You may like one flavor better than the other two, but they theoretically should not be different enough to *really* matter for general tripping purposes. That is, if you take 1P, you are basically on acid - it is not anywhere near the same as taking shrooms or 25i.\n\nIf 1P, for whatever reason, is more debilitating to you, it *is* probably the 1P IMO, but that doesn't mean they aren't \"essentially the same.\" \"Essentially the same\" and \"the same\" are two different statements that don't mean the same thing. They're close enough to be generally interchangeable, but that doesn't mean one chemical won't be slightly better for some purposes than the other two. I agree with you, people are jumping to conclusions with regard to it being a prodrug, but regardless, it's not so different from LSD-25 that there should be a noticeable difference for most people. \n\nBasically what I'm saying is you may just have an odd metabolism - from what I hear there are a small amount of people who have tried all three who can for some reason pick one of them for certain and say it's the one they don't like as much. For whatever reason, one of the three tends to behave differently for some people. Personally I'm about to try ALD-52 in the next week or two for that reason - it *probably* won't be super different, but maybe I've got an odd metabolism too?\n\nI'd give ALD-52 a shot if I were you and see if it treats you any better. If you can't get LSD-25 for whatever reason and 1P isn't quite treating you the same, maybe you'll get more of the specific effects you're wanting from ALD-52?","subreddit_id":"t5_3a2i8","subreddit":"1P_LSD"}

I have Bipolar I, severe social anxiety, ADHD, and was a high functioning alcoholic for the past few years. \n\nSince starting these frequent trips I have been able to restrict my drinking to only acceptable levels during social situations with zero cravings. I've also found that it has been wonderful for decreasing my anxiety as I have been able to identify during my trips the root causes and face them head on, finding some measure of closure that is comforting. The anti-depressant affects of the tryptamines has been amazing and lifted me out of the suicidal depression that I would experience whenever I was not on medication. However unlike the medication that I was constantly prescribed, it has not pushed me into a severe manic state like the anti-depressants did, and it has not turned me into a toxic zombie like lithium did. It seems to have simply lifted my mood gently and eased my mood swings.I feel like my life is finally coming together. I can focus, take care of everyday tasks, maintain my finances and personal hygiene, and generally take care of myself, all things that I was struggling with greatly prior to my psychedelic usage.\n\nI'm currently waiting on and order of AL-LAD and 1p-LSD and I'm looking forward to seeing how both of them could possibly be of use for me in the future.

MXE, for example, is legal in the US, but one of it's precursors (that is probably changed into a different chemical during the process?

You can measure LSD in the urine all you want, but who's to say that 1-plsd is metabolized by different CYPs leading to the creation of LSD as a minor product and some other chemical as a major product that ultimately inhibits the main conversion to LSD? Or what if said metabolite increased the affinity of 1-plsd on 5-HT2A (I believe that's the one) receptors, more than LSD, effectively inhibiting the effects that true LSD would have?

{"body":"Here's my two cents, just considering the proverbial math behind time frame of videos... \n\nThe video uploaded tonight is obviously the very first episode of \"Dickered up with Pug\" that he did for SwearNet, and the one from last night is also blatantly old... I'm thinking the THC vid from tonight was actually a new one because of a few things mentioned specifically. \n\nHere's why... They mentioned something about a \"new video\" that \"worked perfect\", and yesterday on SwearNet they uploaded a Tomberly spoof that totally slammed Tom Hamilton, and Tiff said \"there's one person butthurt terrible\" and Tom even has his own response video posted on his own channel... The other key point is when Tiff mentioned they are going to see Mekkem tomorrow and that he has been taking good care of \"him\" which means the rabbit that goof drunk Pauliester abandoned and Mekkem took in very recently. Lastly, yeah that eye in the THC episode looked a bit purple. I'm thinking Pug might have been popped at least once by one of the roof dicks. It COULD have been Tom, but I'm doubting that. Also, in the THC video tonight someone walks into the room, and it sounds like stink bugs voice slightly... And from what I can recall Stink Bug hasn't been in many, if any, THC vids. Could Stink Bug be back? Who was \"the audience\" Tiff mentioned at the beginning of the video?\n\n\nI figure that since Pug's videos are at LEAST a day behind from the time of recording to time of posting, the roof dicks came by probably Monday (yesterday) and payment was discussed... Obviously, no payment was made, and words were exchanged that eventually ended up with Pug getting punched. Which is probably fine because it's more fuel for his court case against them... Now, at some point either before or after the roof dicks came by, The SwearNet video was posted about 'Tim', and that started the big ordeal with Tomberly, but that's a different issue, and I'm just trying to make sense of the timing of videos... So anyway, Tomberly see's the video, makes a song with lyrics that are anything but coherent (Something about \"suck my dick you ginger prick...\"), and makes a video... Meanwhile, later yesterday evening, Tiff and Pug record a new episode of THC, and upload it tonight where it's clear that Pug's left eye is dickered from the meeting with the roof dicks earlier in the day.\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2u0s8","subreddit":"1PugLife"}

{"body":"No. The Robinhood price will always be lagged cause it's slow. More likely though the issue you're having is robinhood is rounding. Stocks actually trade out to 4 decimal places, so if you have a sell at, say, 1.75 and the stock hits 1.7499, robinhood will show that it hit your price because they round to 2 decimal places. The limit won't execute until the price actually hits there though, also, just because the stock hits your price doesn't necessarily mean you'll get filled. Orders have different priority, and because Robinhood is free, the priority for their orders is usually behind everyone else's. On top of all that, you have algos front running your orders and selling to people for $0.0001 less, who otherwise would buy from you. Ever notice when I post buys sometimes it will be \"$1.5499\" rather than $1.55? That's because an algo stepped in front of someone selling at $1.55 and sold to me cheaper in order to open a short position, and said fuck you to the $1.55 seller.

{"body":"A lot of the armor was BiS back in the day. Some of it is still BiS in some ways; like I think the Range Armor is still BiS for 45 def pures and the Amulet still has the highest Magic Attack, but lacks the damage. I remember back before GWD came out, the Coif was BiS for Ranged Attack and I bought on on GWD release forgetting Armadyl Helmet topped it...\n\nAnyway, I think it is a bit different for armors under 100m to have slightly higher stats and 350m bows to be significantly stronger than the next best alternative. Though tehcnically the 3rd Age Bow is already BiS due to its attack bonus, but giving it stronger damage as well and still not adding a new high-level shortbow would be a bit sad.

Same with removing smite since that would mean someone with 2 or 3 prayer points could just flick for the rest of the game.\n\nMy suggestion would be to either make prayer buyable like other items, or to make it so it works in a different way in LMS. Best thing I can think of is to make it so prayer changes only occur every 12 or 18 tics (once every two/three seconds). This way there would be more mindgames and you could manage to trick someone to think you're out of prayer just to get a free smite for 2 or 3 seconds and maybe combine it with g maul spec to catch them off guard and remove their prayers completely.\n\nAnother option would probably be to lower the effect of prayer in LMS, maybe tune smite down to 5%, protection prayers protects for maybe 20% at most etc etc. It shouldn't either be useless or game-winning depending on if you flick it like your life depended on it, but correct planing and usage should determine if it's actually useful to you.","subreddit_id":"t5_2wbww","subreddit":"2007scape"}

Like you, I care a lot about clearly designing what should and shouldn't be part of the completionist list.

It might be fun to have something to at least look at long into the future instead of being done again after completionist.

{"body":"**EDIT:** Hastily edited pic to show the update doesn't change anything about what could still be done around it:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/zWlLNrr.png\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Original post:** \nAt the risk of stoking the flames, I\u2019d say this really isn\u2019t the type of thing people should complain about.\n\nFor one, that most recent remap I did was meant as a potential view *after* batch 2 (i.e. Raids), once the current parts of Zeah were in a more complete state.\n\nSecondly, everything we\u2019ve seen so far of the Wintertodt points towards it being, well, a pretty decent update:\n\n- As Mod West pointed out before, he was very cautious with adding too much excessive space between Kourend &amp; the Wintertodt itself due to initial Kourend feedback (in fairness rightly so). \n\n- The scope of this piece of content was literally just \u201ca skilling boss\u201d update, not a \u201cfill out the north of Zeah\u201d update. All of the black &amp; empty areas around it are still totally open for updating &amp; will be easier for the OSRS team to do - at least in relation to trying to edit and alter what already exists to the south. \n\n- The pathway leading there is a short but reasonably interesting scenic route, which - most importantly - is optional as there will already be a teleport op to take you right there added to the games necklace. There also appears to be breathing room for expansion both east &amp; west. \n\n- The content itself is fairly simple but still unique, adding a new dangerous form of skilling to the game. Ideally this will be adding variety without devaluing existing methods. \n\n- The rewards are again fairly simple but nice additions that are unlikely to shake up the game too much (regular exp boosting outfit, a combat item that brings fire spells on the normal spellbook somewhat into viability again). \n\n- And of course there\u2019s the fact (though admittedly it may not be known by all) that Mod West will definitely be making changes to Kourend, and the northern snowy regions will be a part of that. \n\n\n\nIf we\u2019re going to provide feedback for things I really feel like that should be directed into useful areas. \n\nYes, I stand by the fact that the rest of Kourend has issues that negatively affect gameplay. \n\nNo, I don\u2019t think this update (or at least what we\u2019ve seen of it so far) shares those issues.
