{"body":"Thanks, good to know","subreddit_id":"t5_2sbet","subreddit":"0ad"}
{"body":"Sweet! Thanks for the info! Another thing I would like to know is unit counters, like what counters what, and you seem like you would know these. Is it a basic \"infantry beats cavalry, cavalry beat archers, archers beat infantry\" triad like Age of Empires or something different? I would like to change my army composition if the AI starts getting certain units out.","subreddit_id":"t5_2sbet","subreddit":"0ad"}
{"body":"This is my current strategy. Some of the most important parts are to have constant unit production, to build houses in advance so that you don't stop your constant unit production, and to collect resources in such a way that you don't have too much of one resource, if you have a lot of one resource then it means that the time could have been spent collecting a different resource that you need more.\n\n* Send villagers to berry bushes, create as many villagers as you can\n\n* Send horse unit to chickens or nearby animals\n\n* Build house with 4 military units and then build storage building by wood and have them collect wood\n\n* Send villagers to berry bushes until you have 10 there, then start sending them to wood\n\n* When you think you can comfortably spend wood, build infantry skirmishers. These units seem to be quite a bit stronger than archers and slingers, and they can hit and run melee units.\n\n* When berry bushes run out, build farms around town centre. When food looks like it might start running low start sending villagers to build farms. Build a mill (I forget what it's called) and build farms around it, only build as many farms as you need since units can be collecting other resources.\n\n* When you have 800 food and 800 wood (I think), upgrade to the next age. At this point I usually take a number of citizen soldiers and have them build a storage building between the stone and metal supplies and get them to start collecting those.\n\n* Eventually, build a second town centre somewhere, and build two markets as far apart as you can while they are still safe, and set up trade between them. I usually built a market as soon as I hit the age when they are unlocked, don't be afraid to trade resources if you have too much of one (usually food) and need something else.\n\n* Keep building units and collecting resources until you can build champion units, then mass those and attack everyone, a few rams/elephants help\n\nBefore realizing how strong champion units are, I used to use cavalry skirmishers as the base of my army. They seem to be very strong and can hit and run melee units, you can make an army of like 30 cavalry skirmishers and they should be able to handle most attacks. You can also build them from early ages, so instead of advancing you can build a bunch of them early on and then just have them protect you.\n\nAnother tip is with garrisoning, military units add arrows to the town centre, villagers don't, so garrison more military units than villagers and it will help defeat invading armies. I usually garrison 10-15 military units and then ring the town bell if I am getting overwhelmed. Sometimes I find myself having an enemy army follow my units in circles around my town centre while my town centre kills them with arrows.\n\nI mentioned it before, but there seems to be a pretty big difference between an army of skirmishers and an army of archers or slingers, I think there's a bit of a balancing issue there but oh well.\n\nAlso, being offensive is important. I used to build sword-cavalry armies to surprise and destroy an opponent's town centre, after that the AI is sort of crippled and their buildings lose health and fall apart on their own. If you're having trouble against an AI, I would recommend building 20 sword-cavalry on the side and sending them directly to the main enemy town centre, you might have to send multiple waves and you might have to retreat if they have a lot of spear/pike infantry units.\n\nAnother thing: I've been playing 4-player free-for-all on the hardest difficulty, although a similar strategy should work for 1-on-1. Sometimes in 4-player ffa, all three AI opponents send their armies to your base, I don't know why, maybe it's just luck. When they do that, sometimes I take the army I am defending with (not my whole army, just enough to have their army follow it) and get them to slowly retreat away from my town, so that rather than attacking my town, the enemy army follows my army. Then I send them into another opponent's town, then my units die and the other two opponents start fighting each other. So far when I've done this the enemies stop attacking me, I suspect it ignites some sort of conflict and they keep attacking each other instead of me. I only do this when I'm overwhelmed, but you might be able to divert a lot of armies this way.","subreddit_id":"t5_2sbet","subreddit":"0ad"}
{"body":"I was trying to set up good counters, but I have found it easier to just use a lot of skirmishers (infantry or cavalry) with micromanagement, and then champion units (assisted by rams/elephants) when they are available, whichever ones the civilization has access to, usually melee infantry or chariot archers. Upgrading the units with the blacksmith helps too.\n\n[This site](http://0ad.wikia.com/wiki/Infantry_Swordsman) has information on what units are good against what other units, but I think it's more of a general guideline. In the unit description in the game it shows that spearmen have 2x bonus against cavalry and pikemen have 3x bonus (I think), but I'm not sure if there are any other actual bonuses. In the wiki site it says that spear cavalry are supposed to have a bonus against infantry swordsmen, but I'm not sure if they actually do.\n\nThere are situations where archers have countered my skirmishers, if my skirmishers are busy with melee units, and behind those melee units are archers with longer range, then that will beat my skirmishers, but if you send skirmishers around the melee units and have them attack the archers directly while evading the melee units then again I think the skirmishers win. That has just been my experience though, I could be missing something.\n\nEdit: Also, spearmen/pikemen have a lot of armour and a good amount of health, so I guess you're supposed to have them to complement whatever archers you are using, so that they absorb damage.","subreddit_id":"t5_2sbet","subreddit":"0ad"}
