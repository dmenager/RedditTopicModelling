{"body":"I was trying to set up good counters, but I have found it easier to just use a lot of skirmishers (infantry or cavalry) with micromanagement, and then champion units (assisted by rams/elephants) when they are available, whichever ones the civilization has access to, usually melee infantry or chariot archers. Upgrading the units with the blacksmith helps too.\n\n[This site](http://0ad.wikia.com/wiki/Infantry_Swordsman) has information on what units are good against what other units, but I think it's more of a general guideline. In the unit description in the game it shows that spearmen have 2x bonus against cavalry and pikemen have 3x bonus (I think), but I'm not sure if there are any other actual bonuses. In the wiki site it says that spear cavalry are supposed to have a bonus against infantry swordsmen, but I'm not sure if they actually do.\n\nThere are situations where archers have countered my skirmishers, if my skirmishers are busy with melee units, and behind those melee units are archers with longer range, then that will beat my skirmishers, but if you send skirmishers around the melee units and have them attack the archers directly while evading the melee units then again I think the skirmishers win. That has just been my experience though, I could be missing something.\n\nEdit: Also, spearmen/pikemen have a lot of armour and a good amount of health, so I guess you're supposed to have them to complement whatever archers you are using, so that they absorb damage.","subreddit_id":"t5_2sbet","subreddit":"0ad"}

{"body":"This is my current strategy. Some of the most important parts are to have constant unit production, to build houses in advance so that you don't stop your constant unit production, and to collect resources in such a way that you don't have too much of one resource, if you have a lot of one resource then it means that the time could have been spent collecting a different resource that you need more.\n\n* Send villagers to berry bushes, create as many villagers as you can\n\n* Send horse unit to chickens or nearby animals\n\n* Build house with 4 military units and then build storage building by wood and have them collect wood\n\n* Send villagers to berry bushes until you have 10 there, then start sending them to wood\n\n* When you think you can comfortably spend wood, build infantry skirmishers. These units seem to be quite a bit stronger than archers and slingers, and they can hit and run melee units.\n\n* When berry bushes run out, build farms around town centre. When food looks like it might start running low start sending villagers to build farms. Build a mill (I forget what it's called) and build farms around it, only build as many farms as you need since units can be collecting other resources.\n\n* When you have 800 food and 800 wood (I think), upgrade to the next age. At this point I usually take a number of citizen soldiers and have them build a storage building between the stone and metal supplies and get them to start collecting those.\n\n* Eventually, build a second town centre somewhere, and build two markets as far apart as you can while they are still safe, and set up trade between them. I usually built a market as soon as I hit the age when they are unlocked, don't be afraid to trade resources if you have too much of one (usually food) and need something else.\n\n* Keep building units and collecting resources until you can build champion units, then mass those and attack everyone, a few rams/elephants help\n\nBefore realizing how strong champion units are, I used to use cavalry skirmishers as the base of my army. They seem to be very strong and can hit and run melee units, you can make an army of like 30 cavalry skirmishers and they should be able to handle most attacks. You can also build them from early ages, so instead of advancing you can build a bunch of them early on and then just have them protect you.\n\nAnother tip is with garrisoning, military units add arrows to the town centre, villagers don't, so garrison more military units than villagers and it will help defeat invading armies. I usually garrison 10-15 military units and then ring the town bell if I am getting overwhelmed. Sometimes I find myself having an enemy army follow my units in circles around my town centre while my town centre kills them with arrows.\n\nI mentioned it before, but there seems to be a pretty big difference between an army of skirmishers and an army of archers or slingers, I think there's a bit of a balancing issue there but oh well.\n\nAlso, being offensive is important. I used to build sword-cavalry armies to surprise and destroy an opponent's town centre, after that the AI is sort of crippled and their buildings lose health and fall apart on their own. If you're having trouble against an AI, I would recommend building 20 sword-cavalry on the side and sending them directly to the main enemy town centre, you might have to send multiple waves and you might have to retreat if they have a lot of spear/pike infantry units.\n\nAnother thing: I've been playing 4-player free-for-all on the hardest difficulty, although a similar strategy should work for 1-on-1. Sometimes in 4-player ffa, all three AI opponents send their armies to your base, I don't know why, maybe it's just luck. When they do that, sometimes I take the army I am defending with (not my whole army, just enough to have their army follow it) and get them to slowly retreat away from my town, so that rather than attacking my town, the enemy army follows my army. Then I send them into another opponent's town, then my units die and the other two opponents start fighting each other. So far when I've done this the enemies stop attacking me, I suspect it ignites some sort of conflict and they keep attacking each other instead of me. I only do this when I'm overwhelmed, but you might be able to divert a lot of armies this way.","subreddit_id":"t5_2sbet","subreddit":"0ad"}

Then, Friday, I have some wine and cheese. Then Saturday, I have some wine and cheese and chocolate. Then, Sunday, I have wine and cheese. This Saturday, I totally over-indulged on wine and cheese while watching a movie. I had hiked 10 miles that day and used that as an excuse. But, Sunday morning, I kind of got angry with myself for not being able to keep it together. I knew I was likely to repeat the whole thing Sunday evening. As \"punishment,\" I skipped breakfast. It was tough, but I wasn't actually hungry and I obviously didn't starve to death. I had a regular lunch and my indulgent dinner and cheese ritual. I did not go over my calories or macros and realized that IF might be the answer to my prayers. I am dipping my toe in this week and think I will try to to make that a goal for the last few week's of this challenge. I rationalize it this way: I like wine and I like cheese. Why do I need to deny myself those things? I don't. But, I need to make room for them in a way that doesn't sabotage the hard work.\n\n\n**Today**  I skipped breakfast.  I had a big lunch and a bigger dinner. It was hardest between 9 and 11.  But, I did it. I did not go over my calorie budget. I did not go over my protein macro.

I can't remember the brand I used, but you melt it and it makes a cheese dipping sauce. \n\n3 cups chicken broth\n\n2 cups HWC\n\n1 1/2 tbsp butter (I used salted)\n\nAbout 1 tsp of sea salt\n\nCayenne pepper to taste\n\nA couple squirts of lime juice\n\nXanthan gum...not sure how much I used. At least 1 tsp. Maybe closer to a Tbsp.\n\nPut HWC and chicken broth in a crockpot. I turned it to low, then high when I added the cheese. (The order might be screwy on this, because I didn't have a recipe and decided to wing it).\n\nClean, deseed, and remove the ribs of your peppers. I wanted to control the heat with the cayenne. \n\nDice the pepper, small dice. Put a pan on medium heat, and add your butter. \n\nWhile you're waiting for the butter to melt and get bubbly, cube your cheeses and add them to the crockpot. Turn it on high.\n\nOnce the butter is bubbly, add your peppers, and saute those bad boys. \n\nAdd salt and cayenne (I used about 2 tsp, then added some directly to the soup later...about 1 tbsp)\n\nLet the peppers get soft and a little blackened. \n\nThe lime juice is optional, but I used it to deglaze the pepper pan.\n\nAdd peppers to the crockpot.\n\nOnce all the cheese has melted, add xanthan gum if you want a thicker texture. Also taste it and see if you want more cayenne.\n\nYou can eat it right then if you want, since it doesn't really need to cook long.\n\nMakes 12 servings. I think the calories are around 400, and the net carbs are a little over 5g net.\n\nAnother good addition would be some shredded chicken to make it more of a meal type dish, and up the protein, which is lacking.

{"body":"**Day 146** for me.\n\nIm learning just what I'm capable of doing with Keto. I came to keto in my weight-loss efforts but this is truly enjoyable. It gets to the heart of making food that is darn tasty and I want to eat every day. Sometimes it is hard to stay very low carb, and I often get up to 30g net carbs a day, but it is completely doable like no other. How keto works with my body's potential is the most amazing thing. The more I learn it seems like there is no area of health keto cannot help one improve upon. Especially when you eat fats full of micronutrients like grass fed butter or MCT containing fats like coconut oil. The human engine of metabolism works great with fat just like any mechanical engine needs grease to keep the gears turning smoothly. \n\nSome random things are my thoughts on treat or indulgent foods. I feel like cucumber is an indulgent food on Keto because of the carbs it has. I'm sure a past version of me would think current me is crazy for thinking of cucumber as indulgent. In general I truly don't want a me of the things I used to indulge in like pizza or candy once a week. I say once a week but I know I ate too much when I let myself, even it was just a day or two out of the week, damage done. That was past me attempting everything in moderation. Nope, not anymore.

{"body":"I use My Fitness Pal, but not religiously. As in, if I'm making a big ass salad, my fitness pal is a HUGE pain in the ass. So I figure out the stuff that I'm worried about calorically. So for the last one I made, there were some croutons and ham cubes and blue cheese crumbles. I had about two servings of each (half the bag of a four serving bag), and tallied that up. then I used vinegar as dressing. 15 calories a tablespoon. Went liberal on that, figuring the worst I could possibly do was 100 calories. Then I didn't worry about the calories in the lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, onions or broccoli, but I figure that could get up to 200 calories if I go hard. But obviously, I want those vegetables. So I figure at lunch (A smaller salad and a bowl of soup that has the nutritional info posted), I'm having 800 calories tops. At dinner, about 600-800. \n\nThat works out to 1600 tops for those two meals. So that leaves some wiggle room if I eat something small throughout the day, which I haven't yet. \n\nSo it's not quite scientific. But it's a method that's worked for me in the past. Mainly, I'm aware of what i'm putting in my face, and how much of it I'm putting in my face. But I think for now, a scientific approach to this isn't really going to work for me.

{"body":"well, let's talk ultimate goal.  is it lose weight for 100 days?  or is it to be healthy and alive for a long time?  personally, when I changed my 'diet' it was with long term health in mind.  I will never be able to not eat pizza if they give it to me for free at work.  I can deal with that one meal.  I can then make good decisions at the points that I have control of during the week.  If I can make good decisions 80% of the time then I think I'm winning.  And most importantly, it gets me in the habit of making those good decisions.  One full day of uncontrolled decisions seems to me to be setting up an ultimate failure in the long term.  However, I am fully on board with full day cheating if you have a plan to go with it.  Let's say the ultimate goal is long term health and this 100 days is the start you want to lead to that.  This is great, one day at a time to 100 days.  Once we get to 100, we set another goal, perfect.  In the mean time, how about a sub goal.

Or Black Widow and Hawkeye since SHIELD was gone? Tony and Bruce are explained layer on the film where they were so I can understand that.\n\nThe end of iron man 3 kind of implied that he was retiring and was done building suits. What got him to get back to being a super hero again? He's not really involved with politics too much, and HYDRA was kind of Captain America's thing.\n\nUltron in the comics may have a better character development in the comics now, but even now, he's still just a heartless, emotionless machine. I think the avengers show (earth's mightiest heroes not assemble) did a much better interpretation of him. Talking like a computer would, not listening to reason from others, and just following the orders he was given, but to an extreme level. It's just the personality that threw me off for this movie.\n\nI know I'm thinking way too hard about some of these problems (I had some time to think about them) but it does bug me a bit. I'm not saying it was a bad film; every movie has some mistakes no matter how good it is. We just choose to ignore them when the movie is really good, but they stand out a bit more if they're bad or if we watch them a bunch of times.\n\n[Spoilers!](/s \"Quicksilvers's death was a surprise, yes. But the problem was I didn't really feel emotionally attached when he died. When he died, I just thought \"well that sucks\" and that was it. When Coulson died, I was struck hard, because I got to know him throughout several films. And even if I hadn't, the first Avengers showed him as an agent but still act like a normal person in some scenes. Scenes like him bickering with Tony or him getting excited to meet captain America only to end up embarrassing himself. It made him more relatable. He was the fan who actually got meet the superheroes that the audience wanted to meet. And he acted like how most of us would. He died going up against a god, and probably knew it wouldn't end well, but did it because he knew it was what a good person would do. Not that quicksilver's sacrifice wasn't noble, but a normal guy going up against a god is more impressive then a guy with powers going up against a plane\")","subreddit_id":"t5_2uktl","subreddit":"100movies365days"}

{"body":"&gt;it jumped straight into the action. No explanation as to how or why they're all together\n\nI felt that the film benefited from not having any build-up to that. It was a nice change of pace from the rest of the movies. Plus, they do talk about their raids later on.\n\n&gt;ignored the end of Iron Man 3 and didn't really acknowledge it\n\nI don't think it did? What exactly does it ignore? Tony Stark's speech? Because that speech was not him giving up being Iron Man, it was him declaring that HE is Iron Man and not the suits.\n\n&gt;but it ended up just being evil robot Tony Stark. He was sarcastic and threw jokes left and right, which was very unlike his comic book counterpart\n\nThat, I would say, is because his comic counter-part had time to grow. In the film, Ultron was created and destroyed in less than a week. He didn't have much time to 'grow'. He acted so much like Stark because he more or less a 'child' of Stark.\n\n[](/s \"I guess you could say that you didn't see that coming? Which is the whole point of that.

{"body":"This obviously happened the day before, but this is the reporting of it. \n\n\"Americans fume over Lusitania sinking. May 8. \nThe huge Cunard liner Lusitania sank off the Irish coast yesterday after being torpedoed without warning by a German submarine. It is feared that 1,400 of the 1,978 men, women and children on board have been drowned.\n\nThe famous ship was only eight miles off the Old Head of Kinsale on her return voyage from New York to Liverpool when she was hit by two torpedoes at 2.12pm. Within 21 minutes she had disappeared beneath the waves. \n\nThe casualties include 128 American citizens, among them many wealthy and prominent people such as Alfred Vanderbilt, the millionaire yachtsman. They are also said to include close friends of President Woodrow Wilson. \n\nGerman-language newspapers in New York jubilantly recalled that the German ambassador, Count Bernstorff, took space in the newspapers there last Saturday to warn Americans not to sail on the Lusitania. But the American reaction to the sinking has been overwhelmingly pro-British.\n\nIn Washington the State Department said that it viewed the disaster \"most seriously\" and it is already being asked what effect the loss of American lives will have on public opinion and on President Wilson's neutral policy. Former President Theodore Roosevelt has already condemned it as an \"act of piracy\".\n\nAltogether there are thought to have been between 500 and 600 survivors, but some of those rescued were too exhausted to talk after hours in the water. Others told heart-rending stories of what they had seen. At least five of those drowned were women with babies in their arms.\n\nOne passenger, Ernest Cowper, a Toronto journalist, actually saw a torpedo heading for the ship. He was chatting to a friend just after two o'clock when he got a glimpse of a submarine's conning tower and then noticed the track of the torpedo. There was a loud explosion when the ship was hit forward and pieces of the hull flew into the air, Mr Cowper said. Shortly afterwards, she was hit again aft.\n\nAnother survivor was the library steward. He said passengers were at luncheon \"chatting merrily\" when \"an awful explosion\" shook them. Captain Turner and the other officers did their best to prevent panic, but at least one lifeboat fell into the sea. \n\nThe Lusitania, with her sister-ship the Mauretania, was one of the two finest liners afloat. She was capable of 25 knots, and it was thought that her speed made her safe against torpedo attack. \n\nPolice were called to the Cunard company's offices in Cockspur Street, which were besieged by well-dressed people seeking news. Confirmation of the loss caused a sharp fall in prices on Wall Street today\". ","subreddit_id":"t5_2y3jq","subreddit":"100yearsago"}

Military historian [Hew Strachan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hew_Strachan) argues that strategic plans caused an over-reliance on shrapnel to attack infantry in the open, which caused a shortage of high explosive shells in most major armies.  At the start of the war there was a revolution in doctrine. Instead of the idea that artillery was a useful support for infantry attacks, the new doctrine held that heavy guns alone would control the battlefield. Because of the stable lines on the Western Front, it was easy to build rail lines that delivered all the shells the factories could produce. The \"shell scandal\" emerged in 1915 because the high rate of fire lasting over a long period of time was not anticipated and the stock of shells became depleted. \n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/X1JAIuE.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:PMLloydGeorge--nsillustratedwar03londuoft.jpg) - *David Lloyd George*\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Minister ^of ^Munitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Munitions) ^| [^Imperial ^Munitions ^Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Munitions_Board) ^| [^HM ^Factory, ^Gretna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HM_Factory,_Gretna) ^| [^Munitions ^of ^War ^Act ^1915](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munitions_of_War_Act_1915) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cr8oz9v) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cr8oz9v)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)","subreddit_id":"t5_2y3jq","subreddit":"100yearsago"}

Errors by signalmen are thought to have been responsible for the highest death toll in British railway history. \n\nThe southbound troop train crashed into a local train standing at Quintinshill shortly before 7am today. Its coaches were crushed, and as survivors struggled to escape it was hit by an express travelling north. Two other trains also waiting at Quintinshill were now entangled in the wreckage, which was swept by fire as the cylinders of the gas-lit troop train ignited.

{"body":"The UK held a general election two weeks ago, in which the coalition government which had been in power for the last 5 years was dissolved. That coalition had been between the Conservatives (Tories) and the Liberal Democrats. The Tories now hold an absolute majority, and the Lib Dems lost 85% of their seats. So the future of their party is very uncertain, and some predict it will dissolve.\n\nThe Lib Dems were formed in the late 1980s when a Labour offshoot (the SDP) joined the Liberal party, who as the title of this post noted hadn't had a purely government since 1915. The Tory-led coalition government they formed in 2010 was the first coalition government since 1945, which was itself a kind of bookend to the WWI-era coalition formed in 1915.\n\nI guess it shouldn't be surprising that the same parties are forming variations on the same government for over 100 years, but in this case there are just a lot more parallels than usual. And the election results of two weeks ago shocked everyone, so a lot of people (myself among them) think we're on the dawn of a new age of British politics. If so, future historians may right the history of British 20th century politics from May 17 1915 through May 7 2015.","subreddit_id":"t5_2y3jq","subreddit":"100yearsago"}

{"body":"Xposting this from r/guns.  Figured you all would like it too.\n\nAfter buying some battleship targets and having entirely too much fun, a friend and I decided it's time to upgrde to 10/22s so they're even more accurate.  Can't be missing the last shot on the carrier now (http://i.imgur.com/ZdLXFl6.jpg)...  Now I'd say it's battleship ready!\n\nIt started as a 10/22 tactical with threaded barrel.
